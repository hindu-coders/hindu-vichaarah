PRESUPPOSITIONS OF JIZYAH
The Muslim psyche is of a peculiar making, vis-a-vis its attitude towards non-Muslims. According to the Prophet, every child is born in Islam, but its parents make it a non-Muslim.1 The Qur&amp;rsquo;ân declares the Muslims to be the best community and raised up to guide and govern humanity2 as viceregents of God on earth,3 and Islam to be the chosen religion4 destined to triumph over all other religions.</description>

JIZYAH AND ITS ASSOCIATIONS-IMPLICATIONS
Little research appears to have been attempted on the role of Jizyah in the spread of Islam or even on Jizyah in general. We are aware of only one monograph on it, by Daniel C. Denett.1 An article, &amp;lsquo;Al-Jizyah&amp;rsquo;, in Urdu from the pen of Shibli Nu&amp;rsquo;mani (d. 1916) was hailed by Abu &amp;lsquo;I-Kalam Azad as a major breakthrough of the modem age in Islamic studies.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
JIZYAH IN INDIA
Arab inroads upon the North-West frontiers of India, upon Sindh, or/and upon Baluchistan began as early as the time of &amp;lsquo;Umar, the second Caliph, and continued in the caliphate of &amp;lsquo;Uthmân, &amp;lsquo;Alî, Mu&amp;rsquo;âwiyyah, and later on as well. Under Hajjâj bin Yûsuf&amp;rsquo;s orders, MuHammad bin Qâism, a nineteen year old Arab, conquered Sindh in 712 A.D. and imposed Jizyah on the Hindus and Buddhists unwilling to embrace Islam, excepting, however, BrâhmaNa-s and ascetics.</description>

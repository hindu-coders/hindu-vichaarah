  <p>( Appendix A and B will give the reader an idea of
the principal arguments advanced by Mr. Tilak
in the Orion and the Arctic Home in the Vedas to
establish his theories. The Gita-Rahasya being com-
paratively a recent production is too well-known
to require any summary. )</p>
<p>Oriental scholars have advanced vague and uncertain conjectures about the age and character of the Vedas. Prof. Max Muller has divided the Vedic literature into four arbitrary periods, the Chhandas, Mantra, Brahmana and Sutra and by assigning two hundred
years for each period he arrives at about 1200 B.C.
as the latest date at which the Vedic hymns have been
composed. As opposed to this linguistic method of
ascertaining the age of the Vedas, there is the astronomical method which though condemned by European scholars as inaccurate and conjectural, can, if properly
applied, lead us to good results. The Vedas, the Brahmanas and the Sutras contain numerous allusions and
references to astronomical facts. There are several
sacrificial hymns in the Rig-veda. Now, no sacrificial
system could be developed without the knowledge of
months, seasons and the year. It appears that
the Vedic Rishis kept up their calender by performing the corresponding round of sacrifices on the sacred fire that constantly burnt in their houses ; and
as they were not only the sacrificers of the community
but were also its time-keepers, these two functions
appear to have blended into one by assigning the commencement of the several sacrifices to the leading days
of the year on the natural ground that if the sacrifices
were to be performed, they must be performed on the
principal days of the year. Samvatsara and Yajna
therefore came to be regarded as convertible terms.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the principal parts of the year
alias the sacrifice. The Savana or the civil day, as its
etymology shows, was selected as the natural unit of
time. 30 such days made a month and 12 such months
or 360 Savana days made a year. Now, a month of 30
civil or savana days cannot correspond with a lunar
synodical month and so a day in some of the Savana
months was required to be omitted to secure the con-
currence of the civil and lunar months. The year of
360 Savana days was thus practically reduced to a
lunar year of 354 civil days or 360 tithis. But a further
correction was necessary to adjust the lunar with the
solar reckoning of time. The commencement of the
cycle of the seasons was, therefore, the only means to
correct the calender and the ancient Aryans hit upon
the device of the intercalary days or month for the
purpose.</p>
<p>It appears that the early Vedic priests were ignorant
of the motion of the equinoxes. The early Aryans must
have determined the position of the sun in the
ecliptic by observing, every morning, the fixed
star nearest to it. Under such system, the year
would naturally be over when the sun returned to the
same fixed star. The solar year, therefore, mentioned
in the Vedic works, must be considered as sidereal and
not tropical. The difference between the sidereal and
the tropical year is 20.4 minutes which causes the
seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about
every two thousand years. When these changes came to
be noticed for the first time they caused surprise and
were regarded as foretelling some great calamity.</p>
<p>Another important point, relevent to our purpose is
when the year commenced. The Vedanga-Jyotish
makes the year (and Uttarayana) commence with the
winter- solstice. But a closer examination shows that
the winter-solstice could not have been the original
beginning of the annual sacrifices (and therefore of the
year). The middle day of the annual Satra is called
the Vishnuvan day and as Vishnuvan literally means
the time when day and night are of equal length, if we
suppose the year to have commenced with the winter
solstice, the Vishnuvan or the equinoctial day could
never have been its central day. If Vishnuvan was
the central day of the year, the year must have once
commenced with the equinoxes. We may, therefore,
take Uttarayana to mean &quot; the passage of the sun into
the northern hemisphere, i.e., to the north of the
equator ; and thus we can say that the Uttarayana and
the year must have commenced with the Vernal equinox.
While describing the Devayana and Pitriyana, the
Shatapatha Brahmana (ii-i-3-3). lays it down in dis-
tinct terms that Vasanta, Grishma and Varsha were
the seasons of the Devas. It is impossible therefore
to maintain that the Devayana or the Uttarayana
-ever commenced with the winter-solstice, for in
neither hemisphere the winter-solstice marks the
beginning of the spring, the first of the Deva seasons. It is difficult to definitely ascertain the
time when the commencement of the year was changed
from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice. When
this change was made, Uttarayana must have gradually
come to denote the first half of the new year, i.e., the
period from the winter to the summer solstice especially
as the word was capable of being understood as &quot; turning towards the North from the Southern- most point.</p>
<p>All our present calenders are prepared on the sup-
position that the Vernal equinox still coincides with the
end of Revati and our enumeration of the Nakshatras
begins with Ashvini, though the equinox has now re-
ceded about 18° from Revati. This position of the
Vernal equinox was true at about 490 A.D. when
probably the present system was introduced. Let us
now see if we can trace back the position of the Vernal
equinox amongst the fixed circle of stars. From Varahamihira, we know that before the Hindus began to
make their measurements from the Vernal equinox in Revati, there existed a system in which the year commenced
with the winter solstice in the month of Magha and the
Vernal equinox was in the last quarter of Bharani or the
beginning of the Krittikas. The Vedanga- Jyotish, the old-
est astronomical work in Sanskrit, gives the follow-
ing positions of the solstice and the equinoxes : —</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) The winter solstice in the beginning of Shravishtha (divisional).</li>
<li>(2) The Vernal equinox in 10° of Bharani.</li>
<li>(3) The summer solstice in the middle of Ashlesha,</li>
<li>(4) The autumnal equinox in 3° 20' of Vishakha.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these data, astronomers have calculated that
the solstitial colure occupied the above position be-
tween 1269 B.C. to 1181 B.C. There are many passages
in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Taittiriya Brahmana
where the Krittikas occupy the first place in the list of
the Nakshatras. We must, therefore, presume that
the Vernal equinox coincided with the Krittikas when
the Taittiriya Samhita was compiled. The Taittiriya
Brahmana (i 5, 2, 7) says that the Nakshatras are the
houses of Gods and that the Nakshatras of the Devas
begin with the Krittikas. The Shatapatha Brahmana
expressly states that the Sun was to be considered as
moving amongst and protecting the Devas, when he
turned to the North, in the three seasons, of spring, summer and rains. This, therefore, at once fixes the position of the Krittikas at the beginning of the Devayana
or the vernal equinox at the time when these works
were compiled. The Taittiriya Samhita expressly states
that the winter solstice fell in Magha. From all these,
we conclude that the Krittikas coincided with the Vernal equinox when the Taittiriya Samhita was compiled 2350 B.C.</p>
<p>The passage in the Taittiriya Samhita which states
that the winter solstice fell in Magha also refers to the
Phalguni full-moon and the Chitra full-moon as the
first days of the year. Now as evidently there can&rsquo;t
be real beginnings of the year at an interval of one
month each, the passage must be understood as re-
cording a tradition about these two full-moon days
being once considered as the first days of the year. If
the year commenced with winter solstice with the
Phalguni full-moon, the Vernal equinox must have been
in the Mrigashiras (Orion) The word Agrhaayani (Syn. for Mrigashiras), suggests the same tale. With the Vernal equinox near the asterism of Mrigashiras, the autumnal
equinox would be in Mula which was so called because
its acronycal rising marked the commencement of the
year.+++(4)+++ Again with the winter solstice occuring on the
Phalguni full-moon day, the summer solstice fell on
the Bhadrapadi full moon so that the dark half of
Bhadrapada was the first fortnight in the Pitriyana,
understood as commencing on the summer solstice.
On no other hypothesis can the dedication of the dark
half of Bhadrapada to the Pitris be satisfactorily ex-
plained.</p>
<p>When the Vernal equinox was in Orion it was the
beginning of the Devayana and as the constellation is
remarkable for its brilliancy and attractiveness, the
ancient Aryans may have been naturally influenced not
merely to connect their old traditions with it but also
to develop them on the same lines. Thus the Devayana
and the Pitriyana, as representing the two hemispheres
must be joined and the Vernal and the autumnal equi-
noxes became the natural points of union between the
regions of Gods and Yama. The equinoxes were in fact
the gates, of heaven and as such it was natural to sup-
pose that they were watched by dogs (Canis Major
and Canis Miror). In the later Indian literature we are
told that the souls of the deceased have to cross a stream
before they reach the region of Yama which we can
easily identify with the Milky W^ay which could then
have been appropriately described as separating the
regions of Gods and Yama, the Devayana and the Pritri-
yana or the Northern and the Southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Later, it is actually called the celestial river and we are
further told that the land of the blessed is to be reached
by &quot; the celestial ship with a good rudder.&quot; We can
satisfactorily account for these legends by supposing
that the Vernal equinox was near the Dog-star in those
days just near the Milky Way,</p>
<p>There is another set of traditions which can be simi-
larly explained on the supposition with which we have
started, viz., the Vernal equinox was then in Orion. The
heliacal rising of the constellation at the beginning of
the year marked the revival of nature at the commence-
ment of spring and the asterism may thus be said to
represent all these milder influences which in later
mythology were fully embodied in the conception of
Vishnu. But the case was completely reversed if we
take the acronycal rising of the same. It was at the
autumnal equinox that the Dog-star rose at the begin-
ning of night and though strictly speaking it marked
the end of Varsha,yet the portion of the heaven wherein
the constellation is situated could have been easily re-
garded as the battle-ground of Indra and Vritra, who
fought in those days and also as the stage on which the
terrible Rudra made his appearance. On this same
hypothesis we can explain how Vritra came to be sta-
tioned at the gates of hell. Indra cut off the head of Vritra
or Namuchi in the form of a Mriga and this at once sug-
gests whether that head is not the same as that of
Prajapati cut off by Rudra (Ardra or Sirius). The
foamy weapon with which Indra killed Namuchi is noth-
ing but a reference tot he Milky Way, The attributes of
Rudra, chasing of the antelope, his bearing of the Ganges
in his matted hair and fondness for the burning ground
and appearance as a Kirata or hunter — all these can be
accounted for by placing Rudra just below the Milky
Way or the celestial Ganges at the gates of the Pitriyana
and figured as a hunter. In Rig. X 192-2, Samvatsara
or the year is said to rise out of the ocean, the place
where Vritra was killed (Rig. X 68-12). Prajapati as
represented by Orion may also be naturally supposed
to commence the year when the Vernal equinox was in
Orion. Rudra killed Prajapati (or Samavatsara or
Yajna) at the beginning of the year and as Yajna also
meant sacrifice, Rudra was later believed to have killed
the sacrifice of Daksha. So then Vishnu, representing
the happy times of Vasanta, Rudra presiding over
storms and Prajapati, the deity of sacrifices — these
three principal deities of the Hindu Mythology can be
traced to and located in the part of heaven occupied by
Orion when the Vernal equinox was there. Later
writers have described this Trinity as represented by the
three-headed Dattatraya, followed by the Vedas in the
forms of dogs, and from what has been written above,
there can be no diificulty in identifying this personified
Trinity with Orion having three stars in the head and
closely followed by the dog (canis) at its foot.</p>
<p>These and other traditions especially those of Ribhus
and Vrishakapi strengthen the hypothesis of the tradi-
tional year-beginning on the Phalguni full moon. With
the Phalguni full moon at the winter solstice, the Vernal
equinox was in Mrigashiras ; so with the Chitra full
moon at the solstice, the Vernal equinox would be in
Punarvasu. The presiding deity of Punarvasu is
Aditi and we are told that Aditi had been blessed with
a boon that all sacrifices must commence and end with
her (Aitareya Brahmana 1-7 and the Taittiriya Samhita
vi 1-5-1,). The story begins with the statement that
the Sacrifice (the mysterious Sacrificial personage) went
away from the Gods. The Gods were then unable to
perform any further ceremonies, and did not know
where it (the sacrifice) had gone to ; and it was Aditi
that helped them in this state, to find out the proper
commencement of the sacrifice. This clearly means
that before this time sacrifices were performed at ran-
dom, but it was at this time resolved and fixed to com-
mence them from Aditi. Aditi was thus the oldest and
rst commencement of the sacrifice or the year. In
the Vajasaneyi Samhita 4-19 Aditi is said to be Ubha-
yatah Shirshni &quot; double-headed &quot; and the commenta-
tors interpret it to mean that the two termini of the
sacrifice which began and ended with Aditi, are the
two heads here alluded to. These traditions are further
corroborated by the sacrificial ceremonies. According
to the sacrificial terminology, the 4th day before Vishnu-
van or the central day of the yearly Satra is called the
Abhijit day. Now if Abhijit day be supposed to be
named after the Nakshtra of that name (i.e. when the
Sun is in Abhijit) then the Vishnu van or the autumnal
equinox must fall four days after the asterism
of Abhijit ; and it can be shown by astronomical calcu-
lation that with Aditi or Punarvasu at the Vernal
equinox to commence the sacrifice, we nearly get at
the same result.</p>
<p>Therefore, the oldest period in the Aryan civilisation
may be called the Aditi or the pre-Orion period and we
may roughly assign 6000 — 4000 B.C. as its limits.
Then there was the Orion period roughly extending
from 4000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. from the time when the
Vernal equinox was in the asterism of Ardra to the
time when it receded to the asterism of the Krittkias.
The third or the Krittika period commences with the
Vernal equinox in the asterism of the Krittikas and
•extends up to the period recorded in the Vedanga-
Jyotisha, i.e., 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C. and the fourth and
last period of the old Sanskrit literature extends from
1400 B.C. to 500 B.C. or to the birth and rise of Bud-
dhism which may be called the real-Pre Buddhistic
period. It will thus be found that the antiquities of
the Vedas can be traced up to a far remoter time than
what Max Muller and other European scholars were
willing to assign.</p>

      <description>Oh hush thee&#39; my baby, the time soon will come
When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may.
For strife comes with manhood and waking with day.+++(5)+++

 The highest praise that has yet been accorded to Lokamanya Tilak has come, curiously enough, from the Hon. Mr. Gokhale who is reported to have said to an Enghsh friend that, bom a hundred and twenty years before, Mr.</description>

Sugar spends to fatten slaves,

IT has been said of Buddha that the sight, in quick succession, of disease, old age and death took away forever the smile from his lips and joy from his mind and thenceforth the Lord of Compassion devoted all his energies to the solution of the problem of misery.</description>

      <description>We have undertaken this work of popular education with the firmest conviction and belief that, of all agents of human civili- sation, education is the only one that brings about material, moral and religious regeneration of fallen countries and raises them up to the level of most advanced Nations by slow and peaceful revolutions : and in order that this should be so, it must be ultimately in the hands of the people themselves.</description>

Swami Vivekananda.
  I have yet to see a nation, whose faith is determined, by the number of husbands its widows get.
Swami Vivekananda.
  Instead of increasing the elements of friction — the besetting weakness of reformers and dissidents of all kinds — he took infinite trouble to reduce those elements to the lowest possible points.</description>

      <description>At the Poona Congress of 1895, when Gokhale was a secretary of the Reception Committee, the ridiculous controversy started by Mr. Tilak, about letting the Social Conference have the use of the Congress Mandap assumed disproportionate dimensions and Mr. Tilak triumphed momentarily. I do not know what he now (1915) thinks in his heart of hearts of the part, that he played in the matter, though he can, like the skilful advocate that he is, still put a fair complexion on it is necessary.</description>

      <description>An Additional Membership is, as I view it, no sop or gag intended to stop honest and fair criticism. But if it is, I should certainly give it up rather than consent to draw the curtain over the gross negligence or the palpable errors of officials, however high they may be.
B. G. Tilak
 On August 7th, 1895, Mr. Tilak, elected by an overwhelming majority by the District Local Boards of the Central Division, took, in the Legislative Council, the customary oath of allegiance to Her Ma- jesty, the Queen-Empress.</description>

      <description>My position among the people entirely depends upon my character ; and if I am cowed down by the prosecution,
living in Maharashtra is as good as living in the Andamans.
We are incapable of nourishing any sinster feeling against the British Rule and it is thus impossible for any of us to be convicted of such a heinous charge as sedition. Such risks however, we must take * * They are the risks of our profession * * Their (the Government&amp;rsquo;s) object is to humiliate the Poona leaders, and I think in me they will not find a &amp;quot; kutchha reed &amp;ldquo;.</description>

The storms that thunder, winds that sweep.
Always our Captain holds the rudder well.
He does not sleep.
Arabindo Ghose.
 That, for nearly eighteen years of his life, Mr. Tilak was involved in a private litigation, arising out of an unnatural alliance between an inexperienced young widow, a number of unscrupulous persons inimical to him and the mighty Bureaucracy hopelessly preju- diced against him, is known to all.</description>

      <description>Bal Gangadhar Tilak is a Maratha Brahmin, thinker and fighter in one. His is the brain that conceived, his is the pen that expressed, his is the force that has directed the extra-ordi- nary movement against which the bureaucracy is now calling up all its resources.
The Morning Leader in 1908.
 The year 1905 forms a land-mark in Indian History. In that year was carried out the fatal Partition of Bengal.</description>

N. G. Chandavarkar
 Elsewhere we have traced Mr. Tilak&amp;rsquo;s connection with the Congress from 1889 down to the early years of the present century. We have seen, how, in the period of poUtical re-action, beginning &amp;lsquo;with 1897, the Congress leaders showed their ** states- manship,&amp;quot; by scrupulously following a policy of Moderation, which, very often meant inaction, timi- dity or indifference to the National good.</description>

The clouds are covering clouds,

And swirls up mountain waves
The flash of lurid light

When smitten on the head, the cobra lifts its hood ;
And the majesty of the soul comes forth only when a man is wounded unto his depths.

 The arrest of Mr. Tilak, though it caused widespread grief and resentment did not surprise anybody. What however extremely surprised all was that such a mild and innocent article as that of May 12th, 1908 had been selected for prosecuting Mr.</description>

      <description>I have had many opportunities of exchanging views with Mr. Tilak during his stay in England, and every time that I have spoken with him, I have felt that he was truly a statesman and not a mere politician. The way in which he was able to take a sane view of the Indian situation in Britain, within a few days of his arrival in this country (England) made me marvel at his perspicuity</description>

      <description>From the Deccan his (Mr. Tilak&amp;rsquo;s) influence projected far and wide. His prestige as a Brahmin of Brahmins, and as pillar of Orthodoxy, his reputation for pro- found learning in the philosophies of the West and the East, his trenchant style, his indefatigable activity, the glamour of his philanthrophy, his accessibility to high and low, his many acts of genuine kindliness, (his) personal magnetism combined to equip him more fully than any other Indian Politician for the leadership of a revolutionary movement.</description>

      <description>Mr. Tilak is dead ! Long live Mr. Tilak !
The Tribune.
 The situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public man has occupied in India. He was the most success- ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing workers who started the New English School (1880), the Kesari and the Mahratta (1881). His opponents — Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered to their fathers before the substantial achievement of their labours.</description>

Longfellow.
 T IKE his literary career, Mr. Tilak&amp;rsquo;s private life was almost absorbed into his political existence and it serves but to enhance the charm of his magnetic per- sonality and romantic career ; and yet, considered even separately, that private life, lived in the full blaze of publicity, will serve as a model for all those who consider self-introspection and self-elevation as the principle duty of life.</description>

Thomas Carlyle
 Mr. TILAK became the declared editor of the Kesari on 22nd October 1887, and of the Mahratta on 3rd Spetember 1891. Since then, he conducted these journals as proprietor till the last, and though, the editorship was occasionally transferred to others, still he supplied the necessary inspiration, except during the intervals when he was a guest of His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s gaols.</description>

      <description>To me it (i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant because it appeared in the midst of the author&amp;rsquo;s direst persecution when money reputation, influence and everything were at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles.

      <description>Yet this is not the whole man. You cannot say this is he, that is he. All that you can say with certainty is that he is here, he is there. Everywhere his influence reigns, his .autho- rity rules, his elusive personality pervades ; and this must be so, for it is true of all great men that they are incalculable, beyond definition. They partake of the nature of the Illimi- table and the Eternal from which they have sprung and to which they are bound.</description>

      <description>We can sacrcely express the admiration which we feel for a mind so great and at the same time so healthy and well-proportioned, so willingly contracting itself to the humblest duties, so easily expanding itself to the highest, so contended in repose, so powerful in action.

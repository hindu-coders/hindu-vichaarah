      <description>PREFACE
Secularism per se is a doctrine which arose in the modem West as a revolt against the dosed creed of Christianity. Its battle-cry was that the State should be freed from the stranglehold of the Church, and the citizen should be left to his own individual choice in matters of belief. And it met with great success in every Western democracy.
Had India borrowed this doctrine from the modem West, it would have meant a rejection of the dosed creeds of Islam and Christianity, and a promotion of the Sanatana Dharma family of faiths which have been naturally secularist in the modern Western sense.</description>

THE SWORD OF TIPU SULTAN
Making darkness by closing one&amp;rsquo;s eyes
V.M. KORATH
Former Editor of Mathrubhoomi
Historical novels are usually an admixture of historical facts and imagination. As such they are not expected to truthfully portray all the historical events. However, authors of historical novels have the moral responsibility to present historical facts without blatant distortions.
Mr. Bhagwan Gidwani, the author of the controversial novel, The Sword of Tipu Sultan, does not seem to be bound by any such ethical obligations; he does not have any qualms even to deliberately falsify historical facts.</description>

RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE OF TIPU SULTAN
LATE P.C.N. RAJA
INTRODUCTION
Tipu Sultan had, ruled his kingdom only for sixteen-and-a-half years, from December 7, 1782 to May 4, 1799. The territory of Malabar was under his effective control only for a short period of eight years. If he had not secured the assistance of the wily Purnaiyya, there would not have been so many Muhammadans in the states of Kerala and Karnataka.</description>

TIPU&amp;rsquo;S OWN TESTIMONY
C. NANDAGOPAL MENON
(The writer is convenor of Bombay Malayalee Samajam)
&amp;ldquo;If you love me, should you not put up with my weakness sometimes?&amp;rdquo; - Tipu Sultan is purported to have asked Mir Sadik who was one of his ministers. This is a remark invented by Bhagwan S. Gidwani in his controversial novel, The Sword of Tipu Sultan.
Across-section of the new generation of historians and novelists is of the opinion that all the available documents and history books on Tipu Sultan originate from the British and, therefore, they cannot be relied upon, the ostensible policy of the British being to &amp;lsquo;divide and rule&amp;rsquo;.</description>

TIPU SULTAN: AS KNOWN IN KERALA
RAVI VARMA
INTRODUCTION
Of late there has been a concerted attempt to distort and falsify recorded Indian history, very often even by painting dark periods of Indian history as glorious and progressive, to suit the selfish and perverted interests of the ruling clique. One of these attempts relates to the life and deeds of Tipu Sultan of Mysore. Most of his active life as Sultan of Mysore was spent in Kerala, waging wars of territorial annexation and Islamic conversions.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 1
MAPPILAS OF MALABAR
 It would be worthwhile to have some broad idea of the character of Mappilas who became notorious after the invasion of Kerala by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. The following notes are based on the documented history of the period contained in. the Malabar Manual of William Logan.  2. The Mappilas had not dared to disobey their Hindu Rajas before the advent of Mysore Sultans with their Islamic brutalities in Kerala.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 2
NEDUMKOTTA: TRAVANCORE DEFENCE FORTIFICATION
The Nedumkotta was a defence fortification constructed along the northern borders of the erstwhile Travancore State. It passed through the territories of the then Cochin State.
The Nedumkotta was built primarily to resist the invasion under Hyder Ali Khan against Travancore State. It was raised mainly with clay and mud, and reinforced with stones, laterite and granite at strategic places. It started from the Krishan Kotta on the west coast, above Kodungallur, and stretched upto the Annamalai Hills on the Western Ghats.</description>

SCANDALOUS TELE-SERIAL ON TIPU SULTAN
PRAKASH CHANDRA ASDHIR
&amp;ldquo;Should a serial on Tipu be telecast?&amp;rdquo; - this question deserves the attention of every Hindu.
The points made out by a progressive Muslim, Asghar Ali Engineer, in support of the telecast of the serial, &amp;lsquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&amp;quot;, are really very interesting. He bluntly states, &amp;ldquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan may be a historical novel, and the story may be somewhat different from actual history.</description>

TIPU SULTAN: A FANATIC MUSLIM
RAVI VARMA
The Union Government&amp;rsquo;s decision to ban the book on Prophet Mohammad entitled The Satanic Verses, by an internationally renowned Muslim scholar, Mr. Salman Rushdie, has been described as a shameful surrender to the minority lobby of fanatic Muslim leaders like Shahabuddin, Sulaiman Sait and Imam Bukhari. Similarly, the internationally acclaimed film on Jesus Christ titled Last Temptation of Jesus Christ has been banned in India so that the religious feelings of the tiny though powerful Christian community may not be hurt.</description>

TIPU SULTAN AND DOORDARSHAN
K. GOVINDAN KUTTY
It was Bhagwan Gidwani&amp;rsquo;s obvious intention to extol Tipu Sultan when he wrote what he called a &amp;ldquo;historical novel&amp;rdquo; - The Sword of Tipu Sultan. Sanjay Khan&amp;rsquo;s approach to the subject could not have been different when he embarked on his controversial tele-film project based on Mr. Gidwani&amp;rsquo;s book. Whether their adulation of Tipu is consistent with facts of history is what an expert panel set up by the Ministry of information and Broadcasting is supposed to determine.</description>

THE TELE-SERIAL ON TIPU SULTAN
P. PARAMESWARAN
In normal course, Doordarshan should have full freedom to telecast any serial which is not against the interest of the general public. But here, the problem is not a novel. It is the distorted presentation of historical events and historical personalities. In the process of projecting certain people in glorifying terms, an attempt is also being made to deliberately defame certain other people.</description>

HIGHLIGHT OF AGITATION AGAINST THE TIPU SULTAN SERIAL
B.N. JOG
Three years back, one news item which appeared on the pages of many dailies attracted my attention. The news item was about a big studio-fire in Bangalore, where shooting of Shri Sanjay Khan&amp;rsquo;s tele-serial, &amp;ldquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&amp;rdquo; was in progress. Scores of young artistes died and many others were injured in the studio-fire. While going through the press report, I was amazed to read that &amp;ldquo;in this TV serial Tipu Sultan is being depicted as a great warrior and secular benevolent ruler&amp;rdquo;.</description>

HISTORY OF LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST THE T.V. SERIAL - The Sword of Tipu Sultan
Madhavrao D. Pathak, Advocate
 The legal fight against the shameful and motivated attempt of Doordarshan and the Government of India to project the usurper king of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, as a national hero, was a long, expensive and frustrating ordeal. According to authentic and documented history of the period, Tipu Sultan had hanged to death and sold as slaves a large number of innocent men, women, and children; looted and destroyed and burnt down hundreds of Hindu temples and Christian churches; and circumcised and converted to Muhammadanism thousands of Hindus and Christians in Mangalore, Coorg, Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Kerala.</description>

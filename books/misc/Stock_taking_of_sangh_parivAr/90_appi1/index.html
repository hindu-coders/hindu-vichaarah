<p><strong>The Tabligh Movement or Millions</strong><br>
<strong>of Bearded Militants on the March</strong><br>
Sita Ram Goel</p>
</div>
<p>The Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch is supposed to work for national
integration. One wonders, however, if Dattopant Thengdi or any other
stalwart of the Sangh Parivar cared to find out who Maulana Wahiduddin
Khan was and what he stood for before they invited him to “sanctify” the
Samadhi of Dr. Hedgewar by his “august” presence.</p>
<p>“Maulana Wahiduddin, currently the director of the Islamic Center,
Delhi, resigned from a prominent position in the Jammat-i-Islami of
India in 1960.”<a href="#1">¹</a> We shall take up the Jamaat-i-Islami at a later
stage in this chapter. We have to take up the Tablighi Jammat first
because it prepares the ground for the Jamaat-i-Islami or in other words
the Jamaat-i-Islami takes over from where the Tablighi Jamaat leaves.</p>
<p>“The Tablighi Jamaat of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent constitutes one
of the very few grass roots Islamic movements in the contemporary Muslim
world. In 1926 the Jamaat began da‘wa work in the limited confines of
Mewat near Delhi and consisted of a few dozen disciples of Maulana
Mohammad Ilyas (1885-1944). Today the movement claims to have millions
throughout the Muslim world and the West. Its 1988 annual conference in
Raiwind near Lahore, Pakistan, was attended by more than one million
Muslims from over ninety countries of the world. The Raiwind
International Conference of the Tablighi Jamaat has now become the
second-largest congregation of the Muslim world after hajj.”^(<a href="#2">2</a>)</p>
<p>“It was because of his dissatisfaction with the madrasas that Maulana
Ilyas resigned from a prestigious teaching position at Mazaharul Uloom
Seminary in Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) and came to Basti Nizamuddin in
the old quarter of Delhi to begin his missionary work. The Tabligh
movement was formally launched from this place in 1926.  Basti
Nizamuddin later became the movement’s international
headquarters.”<a href="#3">³</a> Ilyas had returned from his second hajj in 1925
when he formalized the movement he had started earlier.<a href="#4">⁴</a> “Jama’ats
come to the <em>markaz</em> [at Nizamuddin] from all over [the world]; ten
years ago a five storey building was erected to accommodate foreign
jama’ats.”^(<a href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p>The first great achievement of the Tablighi Jamaat was the cold-blooded
murder of Swami Shraddhananda. The swami had been lionized by Muslims
when he supported the Khilafat agitation during the first
Non-Cooperation movement (1921-22). “But as he was closely associated
with the <em>šuddhi</em> movement… a section of Muslims cherished bitter hatred
against him. On 23 December 1926, when the Swami after a serious attack
of pneumonia was lying in his bed, a Muslim entered into his room on
false pretext and stabbed him with a dagger.”<a href="#6">⁶</a> It became well
known very soon that the murderer had been hired by the Tablighi Jamaat
headquartered at Nizamuddin.</p>
<p>Its latest triumph is recorded by Shail Mayaram in her book on Mewat
published in 1997. “Around the corner from Basti Nizamuddin is the
Masjid Panjpiran, now one of the centers of decision-making for Mewat.
Maulvis, politicians, and chaudharis assemble here to discuss critical
issues such as the outcome of December 1992 violence in Mewat… There is
a growing currency of the word kafir with respect to non-Muslims. A
Deobandi ‘alim in Punhana told me in the context of attacks on temples
in December 1992 (in retaliation to the demolition of the Babri mosque)
that this was an example of the age-old conflict between <em>kufr</em>
(unbelief) and eternal Islam. A report on the rioting in Mewat that
followed suggests the role of some maulvis in the organization of
protest and later damage to temples, in five places. Some Meos explained
the mobs, largely comprising young persons, in terms of the Otherness of
the Hindu which had been brought about by the work of religious
reform.”^(<a href="#7">7</a>)</p>
<p>The “work of religious of reform” referred to in the above citation
means, of course, the work of the Tablighi Jamaat. Wahiduddin Khan has
narrated with overbrimming enthusiasm the story of how the “Otherness of
the Hindu” was “brought about” in Mewat. We have to quote him at some
length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…This greet movement generally known as the Tablighi Jama’at has
inspired a new fervour, a new zeal to serve the divine cause…Its
founder surprisingly was a slight, short-statured individual rather
unimpressive in personality…It was this extraordinary figure known as
Maulana Ilyas who founded the Tablighi Jama‘at which was to inspire in
thousands of people a religious zeal which had been unknown for
centuries…^(<a href="#8">8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…This family traced its descent to the Valliullah family, who had been
chosen to by God to rectify the distorted picture of Islam which had
resulted from the Taimur family’s wrong attitude to towards
religion…^(<a href="#9">9</a>)</p>
<p>…His [Ilays’] father had set up a small religious school
[Madrasah] at Basti Hazrat Nizamuddin to impart free education to
poor students…It was at this place that he [Ilyas] first came into
contact with the Mewatis. Distressed by their religious and spiritual
poverty, he set himself to reform their condition through religious
education…^(<a href="#10">10</a>)</p>
<p>…These uncouth and illiterate people had converted to Islam on a mass
scale as a result of the efforts of the well-known sufi Hazrat
Nizamuddin Aulia and his descendants, But in practical life they were
far from Islam… They kept their Hindu names, like Nahar Singh and Bhup
Singh; they left a lock of hair [<em>chõtî</em>] on top of the shaven head
as Hindus do; they worshipped idols, celebrated all the Hindu
festivals and made sacrifices to the pre-Islamic gods and goddesses…
They could not even recite the creed of the Muslims [<em>kalimah</em>]. So
unfamiliar even was the sight of prayer [<em>namaz</em>], let alone of the
saying of it, that if by chance they came across someone praying, they
gathered to enjoy the spectacle, assuming that the person must either
be mad or suffering from some ailment due to which he was kneeling and
prostrating himself again and again… Major Piolet, the Bandobast
officer of Alwar at the end of the 19th century writes; “Meo are
half-Hindu in their habits and customs.”^(<a href="#11">11</a>)</p>
<p>In 1921 new problems arose when Arya Samaj preachers resolved to
reconvert the Indian Muslim to their ancestral religion. Thanks to the
religious and cultural poverty of the Meos, the large-scale activities
of the Aryan missionaries met with great success. The solution of this
problem was to impart to them religious education so that they did not
yield to any <em>malign influence</em>.^(<a href="#12">12</a>)</p>
<p>When it came to convincing the Mewatis that they should send their
children to school, they were tough nuts to crack… They ultimately
surrendered before his indomitable will, and he succeeded in
establishing a number of schools where besides the teaching of the
Quran, elementary religious education was also imparted. Work on this
pattern continued until another incident occurred which changed the
course of his activities. On a visit to Mewat, the Maulana was
introduced to a young man who had just completed his education in one
of his schools. Much to his astonishment, he saw no traces of Islam in
his clean-shaven appearance. He was quick to realize his failure. His
aim had not been fulfilled. He had been aware of the problem to some
extent before, but now it had become plain for all to see. The schools
did serve a purpose, but to the Maulana’s eyes only a secondary
one…^(<a href="#13">13</a>)</p>
<p>…As soon as the young people left the school they mingled with company
of their own sort, which nullified the school influence altogether.
The only solution to this problem, as the Maulana saw it, lay in
separating them from their milieu, and it was decided that they should
be withdrawn from it in groups for a period of time, and gathered
together in mosques or religious institutions away from <em>bad spheres
of influence</em>… This formula proved the right one, Engaging them in
religious activities round the clock for some length of time made them
into new <em>human beings</em>. Once the trial proved effective, this pattern
was to be followed in future…^(<a href="#14">14</a>)</p>
<p>Such involvement could not fail to reap dividends: large numbers of
people were brought into his fold from various parts of the country to
spread the message he entrusted them with. Staying day and night in a
religious and spiritual atmosphere indeed worked wonders for them, for
when those people returned home after having undergone the training,
they were changed people, Far from falling under the <em>bad influence of
their surroundings</em>, they sat out to be a good influence on their
environment. The Maulana had found the solution to his
problem.^(<a href="#15">15</a>)</p>
<p>The whole of Mewat was transformed. <em>Great spiritual excitement and
enthusiasm could be seen among the people at large</em>. Where previously,
mosques had been few and far between, now mosques and religious
schools came up in every settlement… They changed their way of
dressing and grew beards, shaking off one by one almost all their
pre-Islamic customs that they had retained after their conversion… Not
only did they reform themselves but they were also inspired to spread
the message of God to those who were as they had been
before…^(<a href="#16">16</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ilyas undertook many tours in Mewat after his return from his last hajj
in 1938. “A dislike for Hinduised garments was created and people began
to dress themselves according to the specifications of the Shari‘at.
Bracelets got removed from the arms and rings from the ears of
men…”<a href="#17">¹⁷</a> The first conference of the Jamaat was held in 1941 at
Basti Nizamuddin. It was attended by twenty-five thousand
people.^(<a href="#18">18</a>)</p>
<p>Leadership of the Jamaat passed on to Muhammad Yusuf, the son of Ilyas,
after the latter died in 1944. Yusuf intensified and extended the
activities of the Jamaat by tours to all major cities in India and also
many places abroad. “An international network was established which also
evoked great interest among teachers and ulama of Arabia, who began
coming to Nizamuddin and Deoband, where they too addressed gatherings. A
vigorous pan-India and pan-Islamic movement had been
constituted.”^(<a href="#19">19</a>)</p>
<p>Partition in 1947 landed many Meos in refugee camps at Humayun’s Tomb,
Purana Qila and several other localities around Nizamuddin. Yusuf sent
activists of the Tablighi Jamaat to all camps. “The victims were told
that their fate was the result of <em>azãb</em> (the worst possible punishment
administered by God), incurred because they were not good Muslims. They
were invited to turn towards God. Some months after Partition, Yusuf
visited Pakistan. At a meeting organized by the Jama‘at-i-Lahore, he
addressed the several hundred thousand refugees from India who had gone
to Pakistan, telling them that to avoid <em>khudrishti</em> (fall from Grace)
they must follow the path of God, and that alone will save the Muslim
world. According to Hasani, the work of Tablighi Jama’ats resulted in a
rise of morale among the depressed Mewatis.”^(<a href="#20">20</a>)</p>
<p>“To the Maulana,” observes Wahiduddin Khan, “dominance on earth was
subject to our leading reformed lives. And he said, &lsquo;Follow the pattern
of the Prophet. Those who neither follow the path themselves nor let
others follow it, will be shattered by God as He does the shell of an
egg… No sooner had the people reformed themselves, through the efforts
of the Prophet, then God sent His scourge upon the Romans and Persians.
Those who did not capitulate before Him perished by His
wrath.’”^(<a href="#21">21</a>)</p>
<p>Those who want to promote national integration with the help of
Wahiduddin Khan, will do well to read his chapter on “UMMAN-NESS” or
“Islamic Brotherhood”. It carries the “text of a speech delivered by
Maulana Mohammad Yusuf three days before his death on 30 March 1965, at
Rawalpindi, Pakistan”. We are quoting a few key passages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet and his companions took great pains to establish the Ummah
(the community of believers)… This Ummah was established only after a
great <em>sacrifice of the interests of family, party, nation, country,
language and so on</em>…^(<a href="#22">22</a>)</p>
<p>Remember! <em>The words, ‘my nation’ my region, and my people’ all lead
to disunity, and God disapproves of this more than anything
else</em>.^(<a href="#23">23</a>)</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon us to remain united whatever the cost. The
Prophet is reported to have said: ‘On the day of Judgement, a certain
person would be brought before God to be judged, and although he had
performed all forms of worship in the world, he would stand condemned.
He would wonder what it was that he was being punished for. He would
be told that it was due to such words of his as had caused friction in
the Ummah that he had been brought to this state. Afterwards another
person would be brought, who had worshipped God far less in comparison
to the former person. But he would be amply rewarded. In astonishment
he would ask; ‘For which of my deeds have I been rewarded so
generously.’ He would be told that on some occasion he had done
something or spoken some words, which had helped to bring the
community together, and that it was his good words that had brought
him all the reward.^(<a href="#24">24</a>)</p>
<p>The collective community of Islam should be supreme over groups or
nations… The enforcement of Muslim Brotherhood is the greatest social
ideal of Islam. On it was based the Prophet’s sermon on his last
pilgrimage, and Islam cannot be completely realized unless this ideal
is achieved.^(<a href="#25">25</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patrons of Wahiduddin Khan in the Sangh Parivar should also note the
thrill which the Maulana experienced when he first reached Basti
Nizamuddin to join the Tablighi Jamaat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was August 14, 1966. At 10 O’clock in the morning we arrived at our
destination - Bangla Wali Masjid situated near the tomb of Nizamuddin
Aulia. This mosque has been famous as the center of reform movement
for decades… Today… it has become the center of a world movement. We
can liken this center to the heart. Just as the blood circulates from
the heart throughout the body, then returns to the same place, so do
the people going out from this place come back to it to recharge
themselves spiritually so that they may continue their journey onwards
with renewed vigor…^(<a href="#26">26</a>)</p>
<p>…The Chief (Emir) prayed, to which others said Amen… After the prayer,
the dispatching of missionary groups was attended to… The names of
those who were undertaking the journey were called out one by one, and
each in turn came up to the chief to shake hands with him and receive
his blessing before he departed. <em>Such a poignant scene evoked
memories of the Prophet sitting in the Masjid-i-Nabawi, exhorting
people and sending them in groups to propagate the message to those
who were ignorant</em>…^(<a href="#27">27</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have not read the orthodox biographies of the Prophet will not
suspect how despicably dishonest Wahiduddin can be. The Prophet is not
known to have sent a single group of missionaries believing in methods
of peaceful persuasion. What he had sent instead were military
expeditions forcing one Arab tribe after another to embrace Islam at the
point of the sword. Those who offered resistance were massacred, their
properties were plundered, and their women and children were captured
for being sold as slaves. Circumstances have changed but the intention
remains the same. The Tabligh movement’s main aim is to prepare Muslims
everywhere for taking up arms when the moment is ripe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Metcalf, the model of early Muslim jihad is implicit.
The amir suggests military/political leadership rather than an
intellectual or spiritual one, and the tours of the jama‘at are called
<em>gasht</em> (patrols).^(<a href="#28">28</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are often told by spokesmen of the Sangh Parivar that they are not
opposed to Islam as such but to Islamic Fundamentalism. We do not accept
the distinction because Islam by its very nature is Fundamentalist. But
even if a distinction can be drawn, we wonder why they refuse to read
what Wahiduddin Khan has himself written in so many words, and identify
him as an Islamic Fundamentalist <em>sui generis</em>. His mild manners and
pretended humility should deceive no one. In fact, he is far more
vicious than the traditional or conservative Islamic Fundamentalist. The
traditional Islamic Fundamentalist is never dishonest in his
presentation of his faith. He never tries the tricks which modernist
Muslim apologists like Rafiq Zakaria or Ashghar Ali Engineer have learnt
from the Christian missionaries in order to conceal the real face of
Islam. But Wahiduddin has gone a step further. He has evolved a
double-speak - one for his die-hard co-religionists, and another for his
Hindu dupes like K.R. Malkani, Nana Deshmukh, and Dattopant Thengdi. He
is thus a doubly distilled poison.</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>Hitherto we have dealt with the Tablighi Jamaat as it grew after its
foundation in 1926. But the Tabligh movement as such is much older. We
have to go back into history and see the Muslim situation after the
Mughal Empire broke down after the death of Aurangzeb (1707), and the
invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali in the second half of the eighteenth
century failed to restore Muslim rule in India.</p>
<p>Muslim ‘community’ in India had remained sharply divided into two
mutually exclusive segments throughout the centuries of Islamic
invasions and rule over large parts of the country. On the one hand,
there were the descendants of conquerors who came from outside or who
identified themselves completely with the conquerors - the Arabs, the
Turks, the Iranians, and the Afghans. They glorified themselves as the
Ashrãf (high-born, noble) or Ahli-i-Daulat (ruling race) and
Ahl-i-Sa‘adat (custodians of religion). On the other hand, there were
converts from among the helpless Hindus who were looked down upon by the
Ashrãf and described as the Ajlãf (low-born, ignoble) and Arzãl (mean,
despicable) depending upon the Hindu castes from which the converts
came. The converts were treated as Ahl-i-Murãd (servile people) who were
expected to obey the Ahl-i-Daulat and Ahl-i-Sa‘adat abjectly.</p>
<p>“During the medieval period,” observes Professor K.S. Lal, “forcible and
hurried conversions to Islam left most of the neo-Muslims half-Hindus.
With his conversion to Islam the average Muslim did not change his old
Hindu environment and tenor of life. The neo-Muslims’ love of Hinduism
was because of their attachment to their old faith and culture. High
class converted Hindus sometimes went back to Hinduism and the old
privileges… Such a scenario obtained throughout the country…” He goes
ahead and describes the state of neo-Muslims in the North-West, Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Central India, Bengal, the Deccan and South
India.^(<a href="#29">29</a>)</p>
<p>Shah Waliullah (1703-62) and his son Abdul Aziz (1746-1822) were the
first to notice this situation and felt frightened that the
comparatively small class of the Ashrãf was most likely to be drowned in
the surrounding sea of Hindu Kafirs. Abdul Aziz had converted his
father’s <em>jihãd</em> against the Marathas and Jats into a <em>jihãd</em> against
the British when he issued a <em>fatwa</em> that India under British rule had
become a Dar al-Harb (zone of war). But <em>jihãd</em> against the British
needed manpower which the Ashrãf were not in a position to marshal on
their own. They had to turn to the neo-Muslims. The neo-Muslims,
however, had little interest in waging wars for Islam. They had,
therefore, to be fully Islamized, that is, alienated completely from
their ancestral society and culture. That is why the Tabligh movement
was started. But early leaders of the movement could not achieve much
because each one of them clashed with the Sikhs or the British and got
killed.</p>
<p>Syed Ahmad Barelvi (1786-1831), a devoted disciple of Abdul Aziz,
travelled to Mecca and some other Muslim countries in 1822 and met
masters of Islamic lore to learn methods of “purifying Islam” in India,
that is, brainwashing the neo-Muslims and turning them into full-fledged
Muslim fanatics. He labelled his Tabligh as <em>Tariqah-i Muhammadiyyah</em>.
But he got himself entangled in a <em>jihãd</em> against the Sikh Kingdom in
the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province and Kashmir, and was killed and
burnt to ashes in 1831 by a Sikh battalion led by Kunwar Sher Singh.</p>
<p>Barelvi’s disciple Mir Nasar Ali of Barasat in Bengal, better known as
Titu Mir or Titu Mian, tried to purify Islam in West Bengal. But he
clashed with the British very soon, and was killed by a British military
unit in 1831. Many of his followers were hanged. Around the same time,
Shariatullah (1790-1831) started the Faraizi Movement in East Bengal
after having spent twenty years in Mecca and Medina. But he died in 1837
without achieving significant results. His son, Muhammad Mohsin better
known as Dhudhu Mian (1819-1860) carried on his father’s experiment. But
he was caught by the British for numerous crimes committed against
Hindus in the countryside and died in jail.^(<a href="#30">30</a>)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another Tabligh movement had arisen in Haryana under the
leadership of Shah Muhammad Ramzan (1769-1825). “He found that the
converted Rajputs and Jats… were in no way different from their Hindu
counterparts in culture, customs and celebration of religious festivals…
Shah Muhammad Ramzan used to sojourn in areas inhabited by such
converted Rajputs, dissuade them from practising Hindu rites, and
persuade them to marry their cousins (real uncle’s daughters which
converts persistently refused to do). They equally detested eating cow’s
flesh. To induce them to eat beef, he introduced new festivals like
Maryam ka Roza and ‘Rot-bot’. On this day, observed on 17 Rajjab, a
‘pao’ of roasted beef placed on a fried bread was distributed amongst
relatives and near and dear ones… Such endeavours ruled out the
possibility of reconversion and helped in the ‘Islamization’ of
neo-Muslims…”<a href="#31">³¹</a> This leader of the Tabligh was killed not by the
British but by some neo-Muslims who got enraged by his vituperation
against their ancient ways.</p>
<p>The Tabligh movement had not been able to make much headway when the
last <em>jihãd</em> against the British was launched in 1857.<a href="#32">³²</a> The
British put it down with a strong hand, and the Ashrãf stood really
scared for the first time. A way out of blind alley was found for them
by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan who crawled before the British on behalf of his
co-religionists. The Aligarh movement he started saw salvation for the
Ashrãf in all-out collaboration with British imperialism. Henceforward,
and till the second decade of the twentieth century, every member of the
Ashrãf fraternity prayed and worked for the permanence of the British
rule in India. By 1871 when Sir W.W. Hunter wrote his book, <em>The Indian
Musalmans</em>, the Ashrãf had become the most obedient servants of Her
Majesty, the Queen of England.</p>
<p>But the Ashrãf was far from being cured of its ingrained habit. Soon
they felt strong enough to demand quid pro quo for their loyalty to the
British. They tried to dictate British policies not only in India but
also in the international field. But the British had their own
compulsions. So the alliance broke down when the British annulled the
Partition of Bengal in 1911 and imposed a peace treaty on Turkey in 1919
depriving the Sultan-cum-Caliph of a large part of his domain. The
Ashrãf, therefore, decided to strike a deal with the Indian National
Congress which had been seeking their support ever since it was founded
in 1885. Ishtiaq Husain Qureshi has summed up the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Muslims realized that single-handed they could achieve nothing.
They had waged a lone struggle against British domination and gained a
modicum of temporary success in 1857 when a fair number of Hindus had
made a common cause with them. Both Afghans and Turks had impressed
upon their leaders the stark necessity of gaining the cooperation of
Hindus. Now was the opportunity and it had to be seized. <em>It had been
impressed upon them that the citadel of British power in Asia was
India, which made all the Muslim countries vulnerable to attack and
encroachment</em>… Therefore whatever the cost involved, the British power
must be dislodged from this citadel. They, like the Hindus, wanted
freedom, but if the Hindus were to play false after the departure of
the British, at least the Muslim countries will be able to breathe
freely. The Muslims of the Subcontinent wanted to be partners in the
freedom of their habitat as well as in the liberty of the rest of the
Muslim world, but <em>if the glory of Islam and the prosperity of other
Muslim lands could be built only upon their own misery and
deprivation, they thought the price was not too high to pay</em>…</p>
<p>The stage was, therefore, set for Hindu-Muslim cooperation and Mahatma
Gandhi knowing full well the depths of the emotions that surged in
Muslim breasts and swayed Muslim minds, was too shrewd a politician to
let such an opportunity go. Muslim sentiments and energies could be
roped in for the deliverance of India for little to be given in
return. The bargain was therefore struck.^(<a href="#33">33</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not want to go into the story of who had to suffer “misery and
deprivation”, and who had the last laugh. What we wish point out here is
that the Tabligh movement was revitalized by the Khilafat agitation led
by the Ashrãf in India.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…The beneficiary of the Khilafat movement was not only Mr. Jinnah, the
founder of Pakistan. Maulana Maududi, Allama Inayatullah Mashriqi (the
founder of the Khaksar movement), and Maulana Ilyas (the founder of
the Tablighi Jamaat) also benefited from the emotionally charged
religious environment of Indian Islam in the late 1920s. The emergence
of these new movements unleashed religious and political forces that
had the combined effect of directing the Muslim position on a parallel
course vis-à-vis Hindus and dividing the two religious communities - a
division which ultimately culminated in the creation of the Muslim
state of Pakistan.<a href="#34">³⁴</a> …Although Maulana Ilyas kept himself
completely aloof from politics… he never opposed Islamic groups
actively engaged in politics… Maulana Ilyas was of the view that the
Tabligh movement and politically oriented Islamic groups although
operating in different spheres, were complimenting each other’s work.
Hence there should be no competition and rivalry among
them.^(<a href="#35">35</a>)</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Muslim rule in India, the ulama had remained
permanently allied to an elite north Indian Muslim culture, hence the
orthodox forms of Islam had not penetrated deep into the daily lives
of the Muslim masses, who continued to cherish the customs and
practices they had inherited from their Hindu past. Since the
nineteenth century Mujahideen movement of Sayyid Alimad Shaheed
(1786-1831) and the Faraizi movement of Haji Shariatullah, the Tabligh
movement is the most important attempt to bridge the gap between
orthodox Islam and the popular syncretie religious practices that are
prevalent among the Muslim masses…^(<a href="#36">36</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mumtaz Ahmad has failed to mention the most important beneficiary of the
Khilafat agitation, namely, the Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind which really
fathered the Tablighi Jamaat and which still supplies most of its
leaders to the latter. The Jamiat can also take credit for Islamicizing
the Indian National Congress in cooperation with the Communists and
Socialists of all sorts led by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
during the pre- as well as the post-independence period. It remains
lodged in the heart of the Indian Republic like a cancer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ulama and the Khilafatists were significant components of the
Jamiat ulama-i-Hind, or the Association of Indian Ulama founded in
1919… The Jamiat was responsible for the Unanimous Fatwa of the Indian
Ulama (1920), sanctioning Muslim participation in favour of the
Non-Cooperation movement. It resulted in the predominance of Muslims
in the Congress movement in U.P…^(<a href="#37">37</a>)</p>
<p>The breakdown of the Khilafat alliance launched a new phase of
conflictual communal politics… Tabligh was begun by Khwaja Hasan
Nizami, sajjada nashin of the Nizamuddin Dargah, M. Abdul Bari, and
was actively assisted by the Jamiat… By mid July 1923 Tabligh had
become such a large project that a <em>closed door session</em> of the Jamiat
decided to establish the Jamiat-i-Tabligh-ul-Islam, a subordinate and
financially independent organization to be devoted exclusively to
missionary activity.^(<a href="#38">38</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these Muslim leaders - Maududi, Mashriqi, Ilyas and founders of the
Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind - came to be known as “nationalist Muslims”
during the Freedom Movement simply because they were opposed to the
Muslim League’s demand for Partition. Nobody cared to find out the real
reason for their opposition to the League, namely, that they wanted the
whole of India and not only a part of it as Dar al-Islam. None of them
ever believed that <em>kufr</em> and Islam could ever co-exist peacefully.</p>
<p>The Khaksars of Mashriqi have disappeared from the scene. Ilyas lived to
found the Tablighi Jamaat which is still centered round his family at
Nizamuddin. The Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind has continued to function in
post-independence India, and grown from strength to strength. It is only
Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-i-Islami in 1941, who left for Pakistan
after Partition. But that has not prevented his Jamaat-i-Islami from
cooperating with the Tablighi Jamaat in India as all over the world.</p>
<p>Maududi (1903-1979) like Mashriqi had come to believe that Islam in
India should work out a strategy which had placed the Communists,
Fascists and Nazis in power - the strategy of a mailed fist wielded by a
determined minority. But unfortunately for him, the British decided to
divide India and quit before he could mobilize the requisite manpower
and assemble the arsenal needed. He moved his headquarters to Lahore in
1948 and his “Jamaat scored its first major victory in March 1949” when
the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan passed the Objectives Resolutions
proclaiming that country as an Islamic State. But the Jamaat-i-Islami
which he left in India “is equally vigorous in defending secularism as a
‘blessing’ and as a ‘guarantee for a safe future for Islam in
India’.”^(<a href="#39">39</a>)</p>
<p>The work of the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Tablighi Jamaat is being
coordinated by the Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow, presided over at present by
Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi popularly know as Ali Mian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Associated with both M. Maududi and the Tablighi Jamaat, he has been
concerned with protecting the Muslim way of life through Dini Talim
Council…^(<a href="#40">40</a>)</p>
<p>Nadwi stated in an address at Jeddah (Saudi Arabia): ‘I am one of
those who believe that a religious order cannot be established unless
religion comes to wield political power and the system of government
is based on Islamic foundations’… He states that Hindu civilization,
like the Greek, Roman and pre-Islamic civilizations, are (<em>sic</em>) ‘no
better than ancient monuments’ that have exhausted their
potentialities… Only Islam can contribute to making India the leader
of all nations from Istanbul to Jakarta, and of the continents of Asia
and Africa. Elsewhere, he writes: ‘mankind regards the Muslim world as
the deliverer and the Muslim world, in turn, looks up to the Arab
world for leadership’, to countries as Saudi Arabia who are the
‘custodians of Islam’.^(<a href="#41">41</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tablighi Jamaat is busy world wide in recruiting soldiers for
Islamic <em>jihãd</em>. The merit one earns by working for Tabligh is enormous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Calculations about benefits from righteous acts can only he called
arithmetical. The concrete <em>faza’il</em>, or merits for prayer, for
example, is astronomically inflated depending upon where one is: one
must perform the canonical prayer, but in a mosque its value is
enhanced 27 times, in Mecca 50,000 times in Mecca 100,000 times, <em>in
the path of God, that is, on a jihad including Tabligh mission,
490,000,000!</em><a href="#42">⁴²</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Islamic jihãd like Tabligh is now world wide because the whole world
except some pockets where the Shari’a prevails, has become a vast spread
of <em>jãhiliyya</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…To hasten the return of Islam requires the defeat of jahiliyya.
Modern means of violence are clearly technological tools: to practice
jihad, interpreted as armed struggle against jahiliyya, the most
effective weaponry available provides the means… ‘Adel Hammuda
summarizes the story of al-Jihad as “Bombs and Holy Books” (<em>Qanabil
wa masahif</em>). In Hasan al-Banna’s legacy is the call “from the Holy
Book to dynamite” (<em>mina al-mishaf ila al-dinamit</em>) as an expression
for jihad.^(<a href="#43">43</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wahiduddin Khan spells out the meaning of Tabligh when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Sometimes it becomes urgent to make peace, as at Hudaibiyya, and
sometimes defence is urgently called for, as at Badr and
Hunain…^(<a href="#44">44</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot expect leaders of the Sangh Parivar to read a biography of the
Prophet, and find out what Hudaibiyya, Badr and Hunain stand for and
what “peace” and “defence” mean in the language of Islam, They are bent
upon repeating Mahatma Gandhi who refused to read the Dogmatics and
Polemics of Islam and claimed to know the “noble faith of Islam” better
then those who had studied this doctrine and its history from its
primary sources. He harboured a life-long illusion that the Maulanas of
the Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind would help him in bringing the Muslim masses
into the national mainstream. They helped him all right and to the hilt,
but only in stamping out even the least little voice of resistance to
naked Muslim aggression. He ended by becoming the Father of Pakistan,
and a <em>shahîd</em> in the service of <em>sarva-dharma-samabhãva</em>. We harbour
not the shadow of a doubt that the Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch is pushing
on the same path whatever has survived of Hindu society and culture in
the shrunken and shrinking Hindu homeland.</p>

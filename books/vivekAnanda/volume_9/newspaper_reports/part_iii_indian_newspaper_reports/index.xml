There has been some lively correspondence between Swami Vivekanand and a retired Christian Missionary on the work and prospects of Christianity in India. Among other things, the Swami is reported to have said that &amp;ldquo;the way of converting is absolutely absurd&amp;rdquo;;
Missionary doctors do no good, because they are not in touch with the people.</description>

Swami Vivekananda explained in America the central idea of the Vedas as follows:
I humbly beg to differ from those who see in monotheism, in the recognition of a personal God, apart from Nature, the acme of intellectual development. I believe, it is only a kind of anthropomorphism which the human mind stumbles upon in its first efforts to understand the unknown.</description>

[The Bengalee, May 18, 1895]
There is not a Hindoo who is not proud of Vivekananda Swami — who would not honor him and his teachings. He has done honor to himself, to his race and his religion. If we are right in this view, it follows that the opinions of Vivekananda are entitled to the highest consideration.</description>

He said that religion was the most wonderful factor in the social organism. If knowledge was the highest gain that science could give, what could be greater than the knowledge of God, of the soul, of man&amp;rsquo;s own nature which was given by the study of religion?</description>

NOTE Swami Vivekananda delivered scores of lectures and classes during his relatively short ministry. Unfortunately the Swami was not always accompanied by a professional stenographer who could keep pace with the exceptional speed of his extempore deliveries. However, a few students managed to take notes of some lectures and classes, which are today the only available records of works that would otherwise have been lost to the world.</description>

These notes of daily morning classes delivered at Greenacre, Maine, in the summer of 1894 and recorded by Miss Emma Thursby were discovered among Miss Emma Thursby&amp;rsquo;s papers at the New-York Historical Society. They have been lightly edited in order to conform to the style of the Complete Works.
Notes taken miscellaneously from discourses given by Swami Vivekananda under the &amp;ldquo;Pine&amp;rdquo; at Greenacre in July and August 1894.</description>

[From Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of a lecture delivered in San Francisco, California, on March 11, 1900]
Everything progresses in waves. The march of civilization, the progression of worlds, is in waves. All human activities likewise progress in waves — art, literature, science, religion.
Great waves succeed each other, and between these great waves is a quiet, a calm, a period of rest, a period of recuperation.</description>

[Excerpts of Ida Ansell&amp;rsquo;s first transcript of Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s San Francisco lecture delivered Sunday, March 25, 1900]
Mohammed [After stating that he would &amp;ldquo;take Mohammed and bring out the particular work of the great Arabian prophet&amp;rdquo;, Swami Vivekananda continued his lecture.]
Each great messenger not only creates a new order of things, but is himself the creation of a certain order of things.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of a class delivered in San Francisco, California, on Monday, March 26, 1900]
The first point is the position. Sit with the spine perfectly free, with the weight resting on the hips. The next step is breathing. Breathe in the left nostril and out the right. Fill the lungs full and eject all the breath.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of a Bhagavad-Gitā class delivered Thursday, May 24, 1900, in San Francisco, California]
The Gitā is the gist of the Vedas. It is not our Bible; the Upanishads are our Bible. It [the Gita] is the gist of the Upanishads and harmonizes the many contradictory parts of the Upanishads.
The Vedas are divided into two portions — the work portion and the knowledge portion.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of a Bhagavad-Gitā lecture delivered Saturday, May 26, 1900, in San Francisco, California]
The Gitā is to the Hindus what the New Testament is to the Christians. It is about five thousand years old, and the day of religious celebrations with the Hindus is the anniversary of the Battle of Kurukshetra about five thousand years ago.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of the Bhagavad-Gitā lecture delivered Tuesday, May 29, 1900, in San Francisco, California]
 &amp;ldquo;If you know everything, disturb not the childlike faith of the innocent.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Religion is the realization of Spirit as Spirit. Not spirit as matter.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You are spirit. Realize yourselves as spirit. Do it any way you can.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Religion is a growth&amp;rdquo;: each one must experience it himself.</description>

[Sister Nivedita&amp;rsquo;s notes of a New York Bhagavad-Gitā class, recorded in a June 16, 1900 letter to Miss Josephine MacLeod]
This morning the lesson on the Gitā was grand. It began with a long talk on the fact that the highest ideals are not for all. Non-resistance is not for the man who thinks the replacing of the maggot in the wound by the leprous saint with &amp;ldquo;Eat, Brother!</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s random lecture notes, most of which seem to pertain to chapter two of the Bhagavad-Gitā]
&amp;ldquo;Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone.&amp;rdquo;
The first discourse in the Gita can be taken allegorically.
&amp;ldquo;The Vedas only teach of things in nature, only teach of nature.&amp;rdquo;
We are always letting sentiment usurp the place of duty, and flattering ourselves that we are acting in response to true love.</description>

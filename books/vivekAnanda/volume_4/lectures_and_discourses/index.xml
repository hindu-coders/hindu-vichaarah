      <description>THE RAMAYANA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, January 31, 1900)
There are two great epics in the Sanskrit language, which are very ancient. Of course, there are hundreds of other epic poems. The Sanskrit language and literature have been continued down to the present day, although, for more than two thousand years, it has ceased to be a spoken language. I am now going to speak to you of the two most ancient epics, called the Rāmāyana and the Mahābhārata.</description>

      <description>THE MAHABHARATA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, February 1, 1900)
The other epic about which I am going to speak to you this evening, is called the Mahābhārata. It contains the story of a race descended from King Bharata, who was the son of Dushyanta and Shakuntalā. Mahā means great, and Bhārata means the descendants of Bharata, from whom India has derived its name, Bhārata. Mahabharata means Great India, or the story of the great descendants of Bharata.</description>

      <description>THOUGHTS ON THE GITA During his sojourn in Calcutta in 1897, Swami Vivekananda used to stay for the most part at the Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrisnna Mission, located then at Alambazar. During this time several young men, who had been preparing themselves for some time previously, gathered round him and took the vows of Brahmacharya and Sannyāsa, and Swamiji began to train them for future work, by holding classes on the Gitā and Vedanta, and initiating them into the practices of meditation.</description>

      <description>THE STORY OF JADA BHARATA (Delivered in California)
There was a great monarch named Bharata. The land which is called India by foreigners is known to her children as Bhārata Varsha. Now, it is enjoined on every Hindu when he becomes old, to give up all worldly pursuits — to leave the cares of the world, its wealth, happiness, and enjoyments to his son — and retire into the forest, there to meditate upon the Self which is the only reality in him, and thus break the bonds which bind him to life.</description>

      <description>THE STORY OF PRAHLADA (Delivered in California)
Hiranyakashipu was the king of the Daityas. The Daityas, though born of the same parentage as the Devas or gods, were always, at war with the latter. The Daityas had no part in the oblations and offerings of mankind, or in the government of the world and its guidance. But sometimes they waxed strong and drove all the Devas from the heaven, and seized the throne of the gods and ruled for a time.</description>

      <description>THE GREAT TEACHERS OF THE WORLD (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, February 3, 1900)
The universe, according to the theory of the Hindus, is moving in cycles of wave forms. It rises, reaches its zenith, then falls and remains in the hollow, as it were, for some time, once more to rise, and so on, in wave after wave and fall after fall. What is true of the universe is true of every part of it.</description>

      <description>ON LORD BUDDHA (Delivered in Detroit)
In every religion we find one type of self-devotion particularly developed. The type of working without a motive is most highly developed in Buddhism. Do not mistake Buddhism and Brāhminism. In this country you are very apt to do so. Buddhism is one of our sects. It was founded by a great man called Gautama, who became disgusted at the eternal metaphysical discussions of his day, and the cumbrous rituals, and more especially with the caste system.</description>

      <description>CHRIST, THE MESSENGER (Delivered at Los Angeles, California, 1900)
The wave rises on the ocean, and there is a hollow. Again another wave rises, perhaps bigger than the former, to fall down again, similarly, again to rise — driving onward. In the march of events, we notice the rise and fall, and we generally look towards the rise, forgetting the fall. But both are necessary, and both are great. This is the nature of the universe.</description>

      <description>MY MASTER (Two lectures delivered in New York and England in 1896 were combined subsequently under the present heading.)
&amp;ldquo;Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails, I come down to help mankind,&amp;rdquo; declares Krishna, in the Bhagavad-Gitā. Whenever this world of ours, on account of growth, on account of added circumstances, requires a new adjustment, a wave of power comes; and as a man is acting on two planes, the spiritual and the material, waves of adjustment come on both planes.</description>

      <description>INDIAN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT (Delivered under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Society, in the Art Gallery of the Pouch Mansion, Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn, U.S.A.)
India, although only half the size of the United States, contains a population of over two hundred and ninety millions, and there are three religions which hold sway over them — the Mohammedan, the Buddhist (including the Jain), and the Hindu. The adherents of the first mentioned number about sixty millions, of the second about nine millions, while the last embrace nearly two hundred and six millions.</description>

      <description>THE BASIS FOR PSYCHIC OR SPIRITUAL RESEARCH It was not often that Swami Vivekananda, while in the West, took part in debates. One such occasion in London when he did so was during the discussion of a lecture on, &amp;ldquo;Can Psychic Phenomena be proved from a Scientific Basis?&amp;rdquo; Referring first to a remark which he had heard in the course of this debate, not for the first time in the West, he said:</description>

      <description>ON ART IN INDIA &amp;ldquo;Arts and Sciences in India&amp;rdquo; was the topic under which the Swami Vivekananda was introduced to the audience at Wendte Hall, San Francisco. The Swami held the attention of his hearers throughout as was demonstrated by the many questions which were put to him after his address.
The Swami said in part:
In the history of nations, the government at the beginning has always been in the hands of the priests.</description>

      <description>IS INDIA A BENIGHTED COUNTRY? The following is a report of a lecture at Detroit, United States, America, with the editorial comments of the Boston Evening Transcript, 5th April, 1894:
Swami Vivekananda has been in Detroit recently and made a proofed impression there. All classes flocked to hear him, and professional men in particular were greatly interested in his logic and his soundness of thought. The opera-house alone was large enough for his audience.</description>

      <description>THE CLAIMS OF RELIGION (Sunday, 5th January)
(Portions of this lecture were published in Vol. III, The published portions are reproduced here in small type. The year of the lecture is not known.)
Many of you remember the thrill of joy with which in your childhood you saw the glorious rising sun; all of you, sometimes in your life, stand and gaze upon the glorious setting sun, and at least in imagination, try to pierce through the beyond.</description>

      <description>MEDITATION (Delivered at the Washington Hall, San Francisco, April 3, 1900*)
Meditation has been laid stress upon by all religions. The meditative state of mind is declared by the Yogis to be the highest state in which the mind exists. When the mind is studying the external object, it gets identified with it, loses itself. To use the simile of the old Indian philosopher: the soul of man is like a piece of crystal, but it takes the colour of whatever is near it.</description>

      <description>THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION (Delivered at Alameda, California, on April 18, 1900*)
We read many books, many scriptures. We get various ideas from our childhood, and change them every now and then. We understand what is meant by theoretical religion. We think we understand what is meant by practical religion. Now I am going to present to you my idea of practical religion.
We hear all around us about practical religion, and analysing all that, we find that it can be brought down to one conception — charity to our fellow beings.</description>

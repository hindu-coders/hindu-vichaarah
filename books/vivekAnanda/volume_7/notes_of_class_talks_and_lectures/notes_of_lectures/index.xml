      <description>MERCINARIES IN RELIGION (Delivered in Minneapolis on November 26, 1893:
Reported in the Minneapolis Journal)
The Unitarian church was crowded yesterday morning by an audience anxious to learn something of eastern religious thought as outlined by Swami Vivekananda, a Brahmin priest, who was prominent in the Parliament of Religions at Chicago last summer. The distinguished representative of the Brahmin faith was brought to Minneapolis by the Peripatetic Club, and he addressed that body last Friday evening.</description>

      <description>THE DESTINY OF MAN (Delivered in Memphis on January 17, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
The audience was moderately large, and was made up of the best literary and musical talent of the city, including some of the most distinguished members of the legal fraternity and financial institutions.
The speaker differs in one respect in particular from some American orators. He advances his ideas with as much deliberation as a professor of mathematics demon strates an example in algebra to his students.</description>

      <description>REINCARNATION (Delivered in Memphis on January 19, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
Swami Vive Kananda, the beturbaned and yellow-robed monk, lectured again last night to a fair-sized and appreciative audience at the La Salette Academy on Third street.
The subject was &amp;ldquo;Transmigration of the Soul, or &amp;ldquo;metempsychosis&amp;rdquo;. Possibly Vive Kananda never appeared to greater advantage than in this role, so to speak. Metempsychosis is one of the most widely-accepted beliefs among the Eastern races, and one that they are ever ready to defend, at home or abroad.</description>

      <description>COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY (Delivered in Memphis on January 21, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
&amp;ldquo;Comparative Theology&amp;rdquo; was the subject of a discourse last night by Swami Vive Kananda at the Young Men&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew Association Hall. It was the blue-ribbon lecture of the series, and no doubt increased the general admiration the people of this city entertain for the learned gentleman.
Heretofore Vive Kananda has lectured for the benefit of one charity-worthy object or another, and it can be safely said that he has rendered them material aid.</description>

      <description>BUDDHISM, THE RELIGION OF THE LIGHT OF ASIA (Delivered in Detroit on March 19, 1894:
Reported in Detroit Tribune)
Vive Kananda lectured to an audience of about 150 [according to the Journal, 500] at the Auditorium last night upon &amp;ldquo;Buddhism, the Religion of the Light of Asia.&amp;rdquo; Honourable Don M. Dickinson introduced him to the audience.
&amp;ldquo;Who shall say that this system of religion is divine and that doomed?&amp;rdquo; asked Mr.</description>

      <description>THE SCIENCE OF YOGA (Fragmentary notes of a lecture recorded by Ida Ansell and reprinted from Vedanta and the West, July-August 1957.)
(Delivered at Tucker Hall, Alameda, California, on April 13, 1900)
The old Sanskrit word Yoga is defined as [Chittavrittinirodha]. It means that Yoga is the science that teaches us to bring the Chitta under control from the state of change. The Chitta is the stuff from which our minds are made and which is being constantly churned into waves by external and internal influences.</description>

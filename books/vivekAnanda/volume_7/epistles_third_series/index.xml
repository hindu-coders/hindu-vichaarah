      <description>NOTE
Before leaving for the USA, Swamiji used to change his name very often. In earlier years he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the readers, these volumes use the more familiar name Vivekananda.

Glory to Ramakrishna!
BAIDYANATH,
25th December, 1889.
DEAR SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I have been staying for the last few days at Baidyanath in Purna Babu&amp;rsquo;s Lodge. It is not so cold, and my health too is indifferent. I am suffering from indigestion, probably due to excess of iron in the water. I have found nothing agreeable here — neither the place, nor the season, nor the company.</description>

Glory to Ramakrishna!
ALLAHABAD,
30th December, 1889.
DEAR SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
Gupta left a slip when coming and the next day a letter from Yogananda gave me all the news and I immediately started for Allahabad which I reached the day after, to find that Yogananda had completely recovered. He had chicken-pox (with one or two smallpox rashes also). The doctor is a noble soul, and they have got a brotherhood, who are all great pious men and highly devoted to the service of Sādhus.</description>

GHAZIPUR,
30th January, 1890.
REVERED SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I am now stopping with Satish Babu at Ghazipur. Of the few places I have recently visited, this is the healthiest. The water of Baidyanath is very bad — it leads to indigestion. Allahabad is very congested. The few days I passed at Varanasi, I suffered from fever day and night — the place is so malarious!</description>

Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!
C/O Satish Mukherji,
GORABAZAR, GHAZIPUR.
14th February, 1890.
REVERED SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I am in receipt of your letter of contrition. I am not leaving this place soon — it is impossible to avoid the Babaji&amp;rsquo;s request. You have expressed remorse at not having reaped any appreciable results by serving the Sadhus. It is true, and yet not true; it is true if you look towards ideal bliss; but if you look behind to the place from which you started, you will find that before you were an animal, now you are a man, and will be a god or God Himself in future.</description>

GHAZIPUR,
14th Feb.,1890.
MY DEAR GUPTA (Swami Sadananda),
I hope you are doing well. Do your own spiritual exercises, and knowing yourself to be the humblest servant of all, serve them. Those with whom you are staying are such that even I am not worthy to call myself their humblest servant and take the dust of their feet. Knowing this, serve them and have devotion for them.</description>

Received your kind note yesterday. I am very sorry to learn that Suresh Babu&amp;rsquo;s illness is extremely serious. What is destined will surely happen. It is a matter of great regret that you too have fallen ill. So long as egoism lasts, any shortcoming in adopting remedial measures is to be considered as idleness — it is a fault and a guilt. For one who has not that egoistic idea, the best course is to forbear.</description>

VIII SALEM (U.S.A.),
30th Aug., 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (HONOURABLE PROFESSOR) (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I am going off from here today. I hope you have received some reply from Chicago. I have received an invitation with full directions from Mr. Sanborn. So I am going to Saratoga on Monday. My respects to your wife. And my love to Austin and all the children. You are a real Mahātmā (a great soul) and Mrs.</description>

      <description>IX SALEM,
Saturday, 4th Sept., 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I hasten to tender my heartfelt gratitude to you for your letters of introduction. I have received a letter from Mr. Theles of Chicago giving me the names of some of the delegates and other things about the Congress.
Your professor of Sanskrit in his note to Miss Sanborn mistakes me for Purushottama Joshi and states that there is a Sanskrit library in Boston the like of which can scarcely be met with in India.</description>

      <description>X CHICAGO,
2nd October, 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I do not know what you are thinking of my long silence. In the first place I dropped in on the Congress in the eleventh hour, and quite unprepared; and that kept me very very busy for some time. Secondly, I was speaking almost every day in the Congress and had no time to write; and last and greatest of all — my kind friend, I owe so much to you that it would have been an insult to your ahetuka (unselfish) friendship to have written you business-like letters in a hurry.</description>

XI CHICAGO,
10th October, 1893.
DEAR MRS. TANNATT WOODS,
I received your letter yesterday. Just now I am lecturing about Chicago — and am doing as I think very well; it is ranging from 30 to 80 dollars a lecture, and just now I have been so well advertised in Chicago gratis by the Parliament of Religions that it is not advisable to give up this field now. To which I am sure you will agree.</description>

262 MICHIGAN AVENUE, CHICAGO,
26th October, 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
You would be glad to know that I am doing well here and that almost everybody has been very kind to me, except of course the very orthodox. Many of the men brought together here from far-off lands have got projects and ideas and missions to carry out, and America is the only place where there is a chance of success for everything.</description>

DEAR MRS. WOODS,
Excuse my delay in answering your letter. I do not know when I will be able to see you again. I am starting tomorrow for Madison and Minneapolis.
The English gentleman you speak of is Dr. Momerie of London. He is a well-known worker amongst the poor of London and is a very sweet man. You perhaps do not know that the English church was the only religious denomination in the world who did not send to us a representative, and Dr.</description>

DEAR BROTHER,1
Your letter just reached me here. I am in a hurry, so excuse a few points which I would take the liberty of correcting you in.
In the first place, I have not one word to say against any religion or founder of religion in the world — whatever you may think of our religion. All religions are sacred to me. Secondly, it is a misstatement that I said that missionaries do not learn our vernaculars.</description>

DEAR SISTER (Miss Isabelle McKindley.),
Your letter reached me yesterday. You were perfectly right — I enjoyed the fun of the lunatic Interior, (Chicago Interior, a Presbyterian newspaper which opposed Swamiji. — Ed.) but the mail you sent yesterday from India was really, as Mother Church says in her letter, a good news after a long interval.

DEAR MR. BHATTACHARYA (Mr. Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya),
I was much pleased to read your affectionate letter. I shall make inquiries about the weaving machine as soon as I can, and let you know. Now I am resting at Annisquam, a village on the seacoast; soon I shall go to the city and attend to the matter of the machine. These seaside places are filled with people during the summer; some come to bathe in the sea, some to take rest, and some to catch husbands.</description>

DEAR KALI [ABHEDANANDA],
Thanks for all that I come to know from your letter. I had no news of the telegram in question having appeared in the Tribune. It is six months since I left Chicago, and I have not been yet free to return. So I could not keep myself well posted. You have taken great pains indeed! And for this how can I thank you adequately?</description>

1894.
DEAR BROTHER SHIVANANDA,
Your letter just reached me. Perhaps by this time you have received my other letters and learnt that it is not necessary to send anything to America any more. Too much of everything is bad. This newspaper booming has given me popularity no doubt, but its effect is more in India than here. Here, on the other hand, constant booming creates a distaste in the minds of the higher class people; so enough.</description>

Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!
1894.
DEAR AND BELOVED (Swami Brahmananda.),
. . . Well, do you think there is any religion left in India! The paths of knowledge, devotion, and Yoga — all have gone, and now there remains only that of Don&amp;rsquo;t touchism — &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me! Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me!&amp;rdquo; The whole world is impure, and I alone am pure. Lucid Brahmajnāna! Bravo!</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
We have no organisation, nor want to build any. Each one is quite independent to teach, quite free to preach whatever he or she likes.
If you have the spirit within, you will never fail to attract others. Theosophists&#39; method can never be ours, for the very simple reason that they are an organised sect, we are not.
Individuality is my motto. I have no ambition beyond training individuals up.</description>

DEAR BROTHER (To Dr. I. Janes.),
I was away in the Catskill mountains and it was almost impossible to get a letter regularly posted from where I was — so accept my apology for the delay in offering you my most heartfelt thanks for your letter in the &amp;ldquo;Eagle&amp;rdquo;.

Since writing to you my pupils have come round me with help, and the classes will go on nicely now no doubt.
I was so glad at it because teaching has become a part of my life, as necessary to my life as eating or breathing.
Yours,

DEAR ALASINGA,
Last week I wrote you about the Brahmavādin. I forgot to write about the Bhakti lectures. They ought to be published in a book all together. A few hundreds may be sent to America to Goodyear in New York. Within twenty days I sail for England. I have other big books on Karma, Jnana, and Raja Yogas — the Karma is out already, the Raja will be a very big book and is already in the Press.</description>

He gave me the charge of you all, and you shall contribute to the great well-being of the world — though most of you are not yet aware of it — this is the special reason of my writing to you.</description>

In London once more. The climate now in England is nice and cool. We have fire in the grate. We have a whole house to ourselves, you know, this time. It is small but convenient, and in London they do not cost so much as in America. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know what I was thinking — about your mother!

      <description>Last mail brought the very very sad news of the blow that has fallen on you.
This is the world my brother — this illusion of Māyā — the Lord alone is true. The forms are evanescent; but the spirit, being in the Lord and of the Lord, is immortal and omnipresent. All that we ever had are round us this minute, for the spirit can neither come nor go, it only changes its plane of manifestation.</description>

7th June, 1896.
DEAR MISS NOBLE,
My ideal indeed can be put into a few words and that is: to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.
This world is in chain of superstition. I pity the oppressed, whether man or woman, and I pity more the oppressors.
One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignorance and nothing else.</description>

I have been to Darjeeling for a month to recuperate my shattered health. I am very much better now. The disease disappeared altogether in Darjeeling. I am going tomorrow to Almora, another hill station, to perfect this improvement.

I was very glad to receive your last report. I have very little criticism to make except that you ought to write a bit more legibly.
I am quite satisfied with the work done so far, but it must be pushed forward.

MY DEAR STURDY,
This is not to defend my conduct. Words cannot wipe off the evils I have done, nor any censor stop from working the good deeds, if any.
For the last few months I have been hearing so much of the luxuries I was given to enjoy by the people of the West — luxuries which the hypocrite myself has been enjoying, although preaching renunciation all the while: luxuries, the enjoyment of which has been the great stumbling-block in my way, in England at least.</description>

SAN FRANCISCO,
17th March, 1900.
MY DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),
So glad to get your nice letter. Well, you may be sure I am keeping in touch with my friends. Yet a delay may sometimes cause nervousness.
Dr. and Mrs. Hiller returned to the city, much benefited, as they declare, by Mrs. Melton&amp;rsquo;s rubbings. As for me, I have got several huge red patches on my chest.</description>

SAN FRANCISCO,
17th March, 1900.
DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),
I had a letter from Joe asking me to send my signature on four slips of paper, so that Mr. Leggett may put my money in the bank for me. As I cannot possibly reach her in time, I send the slips to you.
I am getting better in health and doing financially something. I am quite satisfied.</description>

SAN FRANCISCO,
7th April, 1900.
DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),
Accept my congratulations for the news of the cause of the wound being completely removed. I have no doubt of your being perfectly cured this time.
Your very kind note cheered me a good deal. I do not mind at all whether people come round to help me or not; I am becoming calm and less worried.</description>

      <description>Addressee
LI 17th April, 1900.
MY DEAR MR. LEGGETT,
Herewith I send the executed Will to you. It has been executed as desired by her, and of course, as usual, I am requesting you for the trouble of taking charge of it.
You and yours have been so uniformly kind to me. But you know, dear friend, it is human nature to ask for more favours (now that they have come) where it gets from.</description>

      <description>LII 2nd May, 1900.
DEAR AUNT ROXY, (Mrs. Blodgett of Los Angeles),
Your very, very kind letter came. I am down again with nerves and fever, after six months of hard work. However, I found out that my kidneys and heart are as good as ever. I am going to take a few days&#39; rest in the country and then start for Chicago.
I have just written to Mrs. Milward Adams and also have given an introduction to my daughter, Miss Noble, to go and call upon Mrs.</description>

      <description>LIII PERROS GUIREC
BERTAGNE,
22nd September, 1900.
To Miss Alberta Sturges
on her 23rd birthday
The mother&amp;rsquo;s heart, the hero&amp;rsquo;s will,
The softest flower&amp;rsquo;s sweetest feel;
The charm and force that ever sway
The altar fire&amp;rsquo;s flaming play;
The strength that leads, in love obeys;
Far-reaching dreams, and patient ways,
Eternal faith in Self, in all
The sight Divine in great in small;
All these, and more than I could see</description>

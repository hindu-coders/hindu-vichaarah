It is two or three days since Swamiji has returned from Kashmir. His health is indifferent. When the disciple came to the Math, Swami Brahmananda said, &amp;ldquo;Since returning from Kashmir, Swamiji does not speak to anybody, he sits in one place rapt in thought; you go to him and by conversation try to draw his mind a little towards worldly objects.</description>

Hearing the report of such criticism from the disciple, Swamiji would say (in the words of the couplet of Tulasidas), &amp;ldquo;The elephant passes in the market-place, and a thousand curs begin barking after him; so the Sadhus have no ill-feeling when worldly people slander then.</description>

Today is the anniversary celebration of Shri Ramakrishna — the last that Swamiji ever saw. The disciple presented an invocatory hymn on Shri Ramakrishna to Swamiji. He then proceeded to rub Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s feet gently. Before starting to read the poem, Swamiji spoke to him: &amp;ldquo;Do it very gently as the feet have become very tender.</description>

After returning from Eastern Bengal Swamiji stayed in the Math and lived a simple childlike life. Every year some Santal labourers used to work in the Math. Swamiji would joke and make fun with them and loved to hear their tales of weal and woe. One day several noted gentlemen of Calcutta came to visit Swamiji in the Math.</description>

It was Saturday, and the disciple came to the Math just before evening. An austere routine was being followed now at the Math regarding spiritual practices.

The disciple passed the preceding night in Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s room.

The monastic inmates hastened to go to the worship-room for meditation.</description>

Today is the first of Âshārh (June-July). The disciple has come to the Math before dusk from Bally, with his office-dress on, as he has not found time to change it. Coming to the Math, he prostrated himself at the feet of Swamiji and inquired about his health.</description>

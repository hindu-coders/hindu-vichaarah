      <description>AN INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE (In order to truly appreciate this correspondence, the reader has to be informed of the occasion which gave rise to it and also to remember the relation that existed between the correspondents. At the outset of the first letter the Swami speaks of &amp;ldquo;the hard raps&amp;rdquo; that he gave to this correspondent. These were nothing but a very strong letter which he wrote to her in vindication of his position on the 1st February, 1895, which will be found reproduced in the fifth volume of the Complete Works of the Swami.</description>

      <description>THOU BLESSED DREAM (Written to Miss Christine Greenstidel from Paris, 14th August 1900.)
If things go ill or well —
If joy rebounding spreads the face,
Or sea of sorrow swells —
A play — we each have part,
Each one to weep or laugh as may;
Each one his dress to don —
Its scenes, alternative shine and rain.
Thou dream, O blessed dream!
Spread far and near thy veil of haze,</description>

      <description>LIGHT (From a letter to Miss MacLeod, 26th December 1900 (Vide Vol. VI.))
I look behind and after
And find that all is right,
In my deepest sorrows
There is a soul of light.</description>

      <description>THE LIVING GOD (Written to an American friend from Almora, 9th July 1897.)
He who is in you and outside you,
Who works through all hands,
Who walks on all feet,
Whose body are all ye,
Him worship, and break all other idols!
He who is at once the high and low,
The sinner and the saint,
Both God and worm,
Him worship — visible, knowable, real, omnipresent,
Break all other idols!</description>

      <description>TO AN EARLY VIOLET (Written to a Western lady-disciple from New York, 6th January 1896.)
What though thy bed be frozen earth,
Thy cloak the chilling blast;
What though no mate to cheer thy path,
Thy sky with gloom o&amp;rsquo;ercast;
What though if love itself doth fail,
Thy fragrance strewed in vain;
What though if bad o&amp;rsquo;er good prevail,
And vice o&amp;rsquo;er virtue reign:
Change not thy nature, gentle bloom,</description>

      <description>TO MY OWN SOUL (Composed at Ridgely Manor, New York, in 1899.)
Hold yet a while, Strong Heart,
Not part a lifelong yoke
Though blighted looks the present, future gloom.
And age it seems since you and I began our
March up hill or down. Sailing smooth o&amp;rsquo;er
Seas that are so rare —
Thou nearer unto me, than oft-times I myself —
Proclaiming mental moves before they were!
Reflector true — Thy pulse so timed to mine,</description>

      <description>THE DANCE OF SHIVA (Translated from a Hindi / Bengali song.)
Lo, the God is dancing
— Shiva the all-destroyer and Lord of creation,
The Master of Yoga and the wielder of Pināka. (Trident.)
His flaming locks have filled the sky,
Seven worlds play the rhythm
As the trembling earth sways almost to dissolution,
Lo, the Great God Shiva is dancing.</description>

      <description>SHIVA IN ECSTASY (Translated from a Bengali song.)
Shiva is dancing, lost in the ecstasy of Self, sounding his
own cheeks.
His tabor is playing and the garland of skulls is swinging
in rhythm.
The waters of the Ganga are roaring among his matted
locks.
The great trident is vomiting fire, and the moon on his
forehead is fiercely flaming.</description>

      <description>TO SHRI KRISHNA (A song in Hindi )
O Krishna, my friend, let me go to the water,
O let me go today.
Why play tricks with one who is already thy slave?
O friend, let me go today, let me go.
I have to fill my pitcher in the waters of the Jumna.
I pray with folded hands, friend, let me go.</description>

      <description>A HYMN TO SHRI RAMAKRISHNA (In Sanskrit)
ॐ ह्रीं ऋतं त्वमचलो गुणजीत् गुणेड्यो
नक्तंदिवं सकरुणं तव पादपद्मम्।
मोहङ्कषं बहुकृतं न भजे यतोऽहं
तस्मात्त्वमेव शरणं मम दीनबन्धो ॥१॥
1. Om! Hrim! Thou art the True, the Imperturbable One, transcending the three Gunas and yet adored for Thy virtues! Inasmuch as I do not worship day and night, with yearning, Thy compassionate lotus feet which destroy all ignorance, therefore, O Thou friend of the lowly, Thou art my only refuge.</description>

      <description>A HYMN TO SHRI RAMAKRISHNA (In Sanskrit)
आचण्डालाप्रतिहतरयो यस्य प्रेमप्रवाहः
लोकातीतोऽप्यहह न जहौ लोककल्याणमार्गम्।
त्रैलोक्येऽप्यप्रतिममहिमा जानकीप्राणबन्धो
भक्त्या ज्ञानं वृतबरवपुः सीतया यो हि रामः ॥१॥
1. He who was Shri Rama, whose stream of love flowed with resistless might even to the Chandāla (the outcaste); Oh, who ever was engaged in doing good to the world though superhuman by nature, whose renown there is none to equal in the three worlds, Sitā&amp;rsquo;s beloved, whose body of Knowledge Supreme was covered by devotion sweet in the form of Sita.</description>

      <description>NO ONE TO BLAME (Written from New York, 16th May, 1895.)
The sun goes down, its crimson rays
Light up the dying day;
A startled glance I throw behind
And count my triumph shame;
No one but me to blame.
Each day my life I make or mar,
Each deed begets its kind,
Good good, bad bad, the tide once set
No one can stop or stem;
No one but me to blame.</description>

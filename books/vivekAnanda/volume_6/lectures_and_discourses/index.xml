      <description>THE METHODS AND PURPOSE OF RELIGION In studying the religions of the world we generally find two methods of procedure. The one is from God to man. That is to say, we have the Semitic group of religions in which the idea of God comes almost from the very first, and, strangely enough, without any idea of soul. It was very remarkable amongst the ancient Hebrews that, until very recent periods in their history, they never evolved any idea of a human soul.</description>

      <description>THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND ITS GOAL The earliest idea is that a man, when he dies, is not annihilated. Something lives and goes on living even after the man is dead. Perhaps it would be better to compare the three most ancient nations — the Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the ancient Hindus — and take this idea from all of them. With the Egyptians and the Babylonians, we find a sort of soul idea — that of a double.</description>

      <title>416 THE IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY</title>

      <description>THE IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY The idea of psychology in the West is very much degraded. Psychology is the science of sciences; but in the West it is placed upon the same plane as all other sciences; that is, it is judged by the same criterion — utility.
How much practical benefit will it do to humanity? How much will it add to our rapidly growing happiness? How much will it detract from our rapidly increasing pain?</description>

      <title>417 NATURE AND MAN</title>

      <description>NATURE AND MAN The modern idea of nature includes only that part of the universe that is manifested on the physical plane. That which is generally understood to be mind is not considered to be nature.
Philosophers endeavouring to prove the freedom of the will have excluded the mind from nature; for as nature is bound and governed by law, strict unbending law, mind, if considered to be in nature, would be bound by law also.</description>

      <description>CONCENTRATION AND BREATHING The main difference between men and the animals is the difference in their power of concentration. All success in any line of work is the result of this. Everybody knows something about concentration. We see its results every day. High achievements in art, music, etc., are the results of concentration. An animal has very little power of concentration. Those who have trained animals find much difficulty in the fact that the animal is constantly forgetting what is told him.</description>

      <title>419 INTRODUCTION TO JNANA-YOGA</title>

      <description>INTRODUCTION TO JNANA-YOGA This is the rational and philosophic side of Yoga and very difficult, but I will take you slowly through it.
Yoga means the method of joining man and God. When you understand this, you can go on with your own definitions of man and God, and you will find the term Yoga fits in with every definition. Remember always, there are different Yogas for different minds, and that if one does not suit you, another may.</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY AND CHRISTIANITY (Notes of a lecture delivered at the Unitarian Church, in Oakland, California, on February 28, 1900)
Between all great religions of the world there are many points of similarity; and so startling is this likeness, at times, as to suggest the idea that in many particulars the different religions have copied from one another.
This act of imitation has been laid at the door of different religions; but that it is a superficial charge is evident from the following facts:</description>

      <description>WORSHIPPER AND WORSHIPPED (This lecture is reproduced from the Vedanta and the West. See Vol. IV. )
(Delivered in San Francisco area, April 9, 1900)
We have been taking up the more analytical side of human nature. In this course we [shall] study the emotional side. . . . The former deals with man as unlimited being, [as] principle, the latter with man as limited being. . . . The one has no time to stop for a few tear-drops or pangs; the other cannot proceed without wiping the tear-drop, without healing that misery.</description>

      <description>FORMAL WORSHIP (This lecture is reproduced from the Vedanta and the West. See Vol. IV.)
(Delivered in San Francisco area, April 10, 1900)
All of you who are students of the Bible . . . .understand that the whole [of] Jewish history and Jewish thought have been produced by two [types of] teachers — priests and prophets, the priests representing the power of conservatism, the prophets the power of progress. The whole thing is that a conservative ritualism creeps in; formality gets hold of everything.</description>

      <description>DIVINE LOVE (This lecture is reproduced from the Vedanta and the West. See Vol. IV.)
(Delivered in San Francisco area, April 12, 1900)
[Love may be symbolised by a triangle. The first angle is,] love questions not. It is not a beggar. . . . Beggar&amp;rsquo;s love is no love at all. The first sign of love is when love asks nothing, [when it] gives everything. This is the real spiritual worship, the worship through love.</description>

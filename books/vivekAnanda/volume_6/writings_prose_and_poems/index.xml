      <description>HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF INDIA OM TAT SAT
Om Namo Bhagavate Rāmakrishnāya
नासतः सत् जायते — Existence cannot be produced by non-existence.
Non-existence can never be the cause of what exists. Something cannot come out of nothing. That the law of causation is omnipotent and knows no time or place when it did not exist is a doctrine as old as the Aryan race, sung by its ancient poet-seers, formulated by its philosophers, and made the corner-stone upon which the Hindu man even of today builds his whole scheme of life.</description>

      <description>THE STORY OF THE BOY GOPALA &amp;ldquo;O mother! I am so afraid to go to school through the woods alone; other boys have servants or somebody to bring them to school or take them home — why cannot I have someone to bring me home?&amp;rdquo; — thus said Gopāla, a little Brahmin boy, to his mother one winter afternoon when he was getting ready for school. The school hours were in the morning and afternoon.</description>

      <description>MY PLAY IS DONE (Written in the Spring of 1895 in New York)
Ever rising, ever falling with the waves of time,
still rolling on I go
From fleeting scene to scene ephemeral,
with life&amp;rsquo;s currents&#39; ebb and flow.
Oh! I am sick of this unending force;
these shows they please no more.
This ever running, never reaching,
nor e&amp;rsquo;en a distant glimpse of shore!
From life to life I&amp;rsquo;m waiting at the gates,</description>

      <description>THE CUP This is your cup — the cup assigned
to you from the beginning.
Nay, My child, I know how much
of that dark drink is your own brew
Of fault and passion, ages long ago,
In the deep years of yesterday, I know.
This is your road — a painful road and drear.
I made the stones that never give you rest.
I set your friend in pleasant ways and clear,</description>

      <description>A BENEDICTION (Written to Sister Nivedita)
The mother&amp;rsquo;s heart, the hero&amp;rsquo;s will,
The sweetness of the southern breeze,
The sacred charm and strength that dwell
On Aryan altars, flaming, free;
All these be yours, and many more
No ancient soul could dream before —
Be thou to India&amp;rsquo;s future son
The mistress, servant, friend in one.</description>

      <description>THE HYMN OF CREATION (A translation of the Nāsadiya-Sukta, Rig-Veda, X. 129.)
Existence was not then, nor non-existence,
The world was not, the sky beyond was neither.
What covered the mist? Of whom was that?
What was in the depths of darkness thick?
Death was not then, nor immortality,
The night was neither separate from day,
But motionless did That vibrate
Alone, with Its own glory one —
Beyond That nothing did exist.</description>

      <description>ON THE SEA&amp;rsquo;S BOSOM (Swami Vivekananda composed this poem in Bengali during his return from his second trip to the West. At the time of writing it, he was probably crossing the eastern Mediterranean.)
In blue sky floats a multitude of clouds —
White, black, of snaky shades and thicknesses;
An orange sun, about to say farewell,
Touches the massed cloud-shapes with streaks of red.
The wind blows as it lists, a hurricane</description>

      <description>HINDUISM AND SHRI RAMAKRISHNA (Translated from Bengali )
By the word &amp;ldquo;Shastras&amp;rdquo; the Vedas without beginning or end are meant. In matters of religious duty the Vedas are the only capable authority.
The Puranas and other religious scriptures are all denoted by the word &amp;ldquo;Smriti&amp;rdquo;. And their authority goes so far as they follow the Vedas and do not contradict them.
Truth is of two kinds: (1) that which is cognisable by the five ordinary senses of man, and by reasonings based thereon; (2) that which is cognisable by the subtle, supersensuous power of Yoga.</description>

      <description>THE BENGALI LANGUAGE (Translated from Bengali )
(Written for the &amp;ldquo;Udbodhan&amp;quot;)
In our country, owing to all learning being in Sanskrit from the ancient times, there has arisen an immeasurable gulf between the learned and the common folk. All the great personages, from Buddha down to Chaitanya and Ramakrishna, who came for the well-being of the world, taught the common people in the language of the people themselves. Of course, scholarship is an excellent thing; but cannot scholarship be displayed through any other medium than a language that is stiff and unintelligible, that is unnatural and merely artificial?</description>

      <description>MATTER FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT (Translated from Bengali )
A man presented himself to be blessed by a sight of the Deity. He had an access of joy and devotion at the sight; and perhaps to pay back the good he received, he burst out into a song. In one corner of the hall, reclining against a pillar, was Chobeji dozing. He was the priest in the temple, an athlete, a player on the guitar, was a good hand in swallowing two jugfuls of Bhāng (an intoxicating drink.</description>

      <description>SHIVA&amp;rsquo;S DEMON (This incomplete story was found among Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s papers after he had passed away. It is printed as the last article in the Bengali book Bhābbār Kathā.)

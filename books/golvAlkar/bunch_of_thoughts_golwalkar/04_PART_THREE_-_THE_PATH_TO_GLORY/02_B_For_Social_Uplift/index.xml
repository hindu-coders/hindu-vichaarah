      <description>Religious perversion at the root – Historic call of the Dharmagurus – Violent approach recoils – Motivated propaganda of Harijan-non-Harijan confrontation – Special privileges for the needy of all castes – The “untouchables” excel many fronts – Work from the heart– Secret of success in Sangh.
AT the root of the malady of “untouchability” lies the belief among the common mass of people that it is part of dharma, and transgressing it would be a grave sin.</description>

      <description>Divisive policy of the British continues – Uplift through devotion to God – Lesson from foreign missionaries – Declare as Hindus in census – Their backwardness due to our lapse – Spirit of Karmayogi in serving– Questions and Answers.
WE find a strange phenomenon in the Eastern regions of our country. Our Government regognises the existence of the “Christians” but not of the “Hindus”. The Government has classified all the “non-Christians” as “tribals” as distinct from Hindus.</description>

      <description>(*) Address to Coffee Planters and Industrialists
Tea planters, foreigners &amp;amp; natives, a contrast – Trust inherent goodness – First duty towards the poor – Example of Idinthakarai –“Heart” is important.
WE are assembled here to think out what solid contribution we can make towards the cause of resuscitation of our Dharma and our society, which is, I am sure, dearest and nearest to the hearts of us all. I shall give the example of the tea planters in Assam to make a few points clear.</description>

      <description>Making the home, centre of Samskars – Morning chanting, dress, etc. – Toll of “modernism” – Heroic motherhood – Social aspect – Banish “loneliness” – Literacy campaign, training for employment, and Samskars, to needy sisters– Invoke spirit of Savitri.
OUR mothers have a special responsibility of rearing up the budding generations of our society. Now, what does “rearing up” really imply? Is feeding and clothing the children and sending them to schools, the only thing to be done?</description>

      <description>Three classes of people – Essence of education: man-making –Dedication to ideal – Teacher, the pivot – Right home atmosphere – Eschew wrong political leadership – For healthy unions – Role of press and publicity –A thorough reorientation needed.
IT does not seem right to regard the students as community different from the rest of the society. The qualities of the people in general manifest in the younger folk, that only due to the immaturity, inexperience and preponderance of emotions in them; such qualities manifest themselves as an uncontrolled outburst.</description>

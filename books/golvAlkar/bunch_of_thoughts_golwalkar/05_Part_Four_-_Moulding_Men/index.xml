IN our national tradition character has always occupied the place of foremost importance. Character has two facets: the one, which is personal, and the other, which manifests itself in our relationship with society.</description>

ONCE, while I was conversing with a great Sadhu, the subject of frequent student strikes came up. The Sadhu remarked, &amp;ldquo;This is the bitter fruit of dinning into the ears of students by our leaders that they are the pillars of the nation, the leaders of tomorrow and so on.</description>

      <description>Sangh not individual-oriented, but ideal-oriented - Faith in ideal inspires confidence in others also - Instance of people&amp;rsquo;s trust - Beware, dictatorship is coming - Make up for loss of time- Reach the Goal.
NOWADAYS people seem to be very much worried about my health. However, I have directed Dr. Thatte to draw up my tour programme for the ensuing Sangh Shiksha Varga Camps. I have a feeling that if the programme is drawn up and kept ready, I may be able to go through it somehow.</description>

by Lala Lajpat Rai
PART 1 &amp;ndash; [The Hindu-Muslim problem is the problem of India]
[A] THE HINDU-MUSLIM PROBLEM is the problem of India. We have heard and read much of Hindu-Muslim unity. It is always a matter of controversy between the Anglo-Indian [=British person in India] and the Nationalist. The former asserts, and the latter denies, the impossibility of Hindus and Muslims uniting together to form one nation.</description>

PART 2 &amp;ndash; [The Unity Conference and the relativity of rights]
[A] In the discussions at tbe Unity Conference held at Delhi, one thing struck me very forcibly. That was the fact that so many of the ablest and most patriotic Muhammadan young men, as well as a few Hindus, were obsessed with the idea of &amp;ldquo;absolute rights.&amp;rdquo; Time after time it was said that the Muhammadans had an inherent right to slaughter cows, and that that right could only be curtailed by their own voluntary sacrifice.</description>

PART 3 &amp;ndash; [Religions must be rationalised as much as possible]
[A] All those who aim at creating a United India, should remember that India is a land of many faiths and many religions; that these faiths and religions, again, are divided into sections and sub-sections; that these sections and sub-sections practise numerous religious observances ceremonials and rituals; and that some of these rituals and observances conflict with one another.</description>

PART 4 &amp;ndash; [Narrow sectarianism holds us back from obtaining Swaraj]
[A] The observations made in the last article raise several cognate questions, which may profitably be discussed before we come to the political and economic aspects of the problem. Are the Hindu and Muhammadan religions and cultures so fundamentally different, or to be more exact, so antagonistic, as to make their followers naturally and instinctively hostile to each other?</description>

PART 5 &amp;ndash; [&amp;ldquo;Untouchables&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Kafirs&amp;rdquo;]
[A] The considerations urged in the last article are so important .and relevant that I will not apologise for laying further emphasis upon them. Every possible effort should be made (a) to integrate the different religions as much as possible by emphasizing the points [[189]] on which they agree, by eliminating non-essentials, and by restricting essential differences within the narrowest limits; (b) to remove all barriers to free social intercourse between the communities, which do not go to the root of anyone&amp;rsquo;s faith.</description>

PART 6 &amp;ndash; [The history of communal representation]
[A] In this article I propose to trace the history of the evolution of the idea of Communal Representation and separate communal interests. It was in the seventies of the 19th century that the movement for the establishment of the M. A. O. College at Aligarh [[193]] was started, and it was about the same time that the Arya Samaj was founded.</description>

PART 7 &amp;ndash; [From Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to Iqbal]
[A] Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was unquestionably a great man. He was highminded, unselfish, and devoted to the interests of his community. He lived and died for it. His political creed consisted of three articles:
 (a) Non-interference in the affairs of outside Muslim states.
(b) Concentration of all efforts on the betterment of the Muslims&#39; condition at home, and</description>

PART 8 &amp;ndash; [Pan-Islamism and its bankruptcy]
[A] Add to this the Fatwa of the Ulemas that India being a &amp;ldquo;Dar­ul-Harab&amp;rdquo; (a place of war), every good Muslim ought to leave it and migrate to a Muslim country. We know by this time how the Hijrat movement ended; how much money was wasted over it and how much misery was wrought thereby. The best commentary on it was witnessed by me at Constantinople.</description>

PART 9 &amp;ndash; [Hindu revivalism and other communalist trends]
[A] What I have said about Pan-Islamism and the excess of communalism among the Mussalmans, should not be understood to imply that Hindus on their side have been quite inactive and innocent. One thing, of course, is patent. Hindus cannot be anything but Indians. They have no other country and no other nation to look to.</description>

PART 10 &amp;ndash; [The Shuddhi, Sanghathan, and Tanzim movements]
[A] The aggressive Hinduism preached by the Arya Samaj was not political in its conception. That it has been strengthened by political considerations cannot, however, be denied.
[B] This is an appropriate place for examining the origin and bearings of the Shuddhi movement of which we have heard so much of late. The movement is as old as the Arya Samaj or even the Sikh religion.</description>

PART 11 &amp;ndash; [Some suggestions for political improvements]
[A] I have so far touched [on] the past history of Hindu-Muslim relations and given a picture of how matters stand at present. I will now offer a few observations on how the present situation can be improved, in the political field.
[B] It is suggested on behalf of Muslim leaders that–
(a) Communal representation with separate electorates in all the legislatures, local bodies, Universities, and other official or semi-official bodies should be provided.</description>

PART 12 &amp;ndash; [A summary of my conclusions and advice]
[A] In the last article I observed that Mian Fazl-i-Husain embodied, in his person, a real grievance. But a grievance against whom? Certainly not against the Hindu community. If the Hindus occupy a larger number of posts under the Government than they would be entitled to on a purely numerical basis, they are not to be blamed for it.</description>

PART 13 &amp;ndash; [A plea for mutual co-operation]
[A] No Indian who loves his country can look upon the prevailing state of things except with the most excrutiating pain and anguish. There are men in the public life of the country, who have given their all in the hope that before they die they may see the Goddess of Liberty ruling over their beloved native land.</description>

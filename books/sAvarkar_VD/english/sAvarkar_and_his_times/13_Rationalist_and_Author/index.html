<p>Modern civilization is th» atcome of scientific research and
progress. Science and Der io^racy are two great potential
forces in the modern wo) d Democracy defines the shape
and aims of social and political endeavour. It strives for a
good, just, equitable and progressive life. Good and
progressive life demands an equal and proportionately just
enjoyment of all the material and cultural resources and
possession. Those possessions and resources are brought
within the reach of men by science which controls the laws
and forces of Nature and bends (hem to the services of men.
While bringing about this change, science emancipates the
mind of man from the bondage of superstition and ignorance.
Thus science plays a dominant part in the reconstruction of
every country’s life and economy, and solves its crucial
problems of food, clothing, shelter, security, and peace.</p>
<p>Savarkar holds that the greater the domination of
superstition the lesser is the tendency of the people towards
science. So he raised his mighty pen against superstition from
which flowed Voltaire’s satire and emanated the force of
Luther ! Voltaire venerated nothing while Savarkar, like
Swift, did his job with devastating candour. Voltaire smashed
the ancient idols ; Savarkar swept them into a corner as
historical and cultural monuments for record and research.
Voltaire disfigured the idols, Savarkar debarred thern.</p>
<p>Savarkar ’s outlook is absolutely modern and scientific. He
shows the fallacy and hollowness of time-worn and scripture-
born arguments. He denounces the ideologies that describe
the machine as a device of the devil invented to spite the glory
of God and to strike a blow at the influence of religion and
make man feeble, mechanical, helpless and heartless, leading
him to his final doom. Savarkar pierces the Kripan of his
reason through this false propaganda of ignorance. So he is</p>
<p>182 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>to Maharashtra what eighteenth century great European
reformers were to Europe.</p>
<p>About the God of Man and the Lord of the Universe, he
has peculiar views. According to him we live in this world,
but the Universe has nothing to do with us. The belief that
what the Lord of the Universe likes is good and what lie
likes must be beneficial to the progress of Man, is useless,
because it is not true. The forces in the Universe are to a
little degree for Man. but to a greater extent they are against
him. What man can do at the most is to learn the laws of
the Universe as best as he can, and turn them to his benefit
and welfare. This is, he sums up, the real worship of the
Universe.</p>
<p>In his view whatever contributes to human good is good,
what is derogatory to the progress of humanity is bad. The
definition of morality should be framed, he says, in reference
to the common good of mankind. If God is kind enough to
take a man out of danger, and is all pervading, who first
throws a virtuous man into the flames of danger, he asks.
Who sinks steamers full of men, children and women despite
heartfelt prayers ? Who sets conflagration to the woods and
roasts the birds, reptiles and other creatures like fishes ?
Savarkar says why does God make the wicked so powerful
as to be in a position to harass the good ? If God is omniscient
and most kind, does he not know the innocence and purity
of that good man beforehand ? Why does he at all test the
virtuous man through cruel and fierce ordeals ? In this
respect Savarkar is more agnostic than Ingersoll, and more
balanced than Agarkar, the giant rationalist of Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Savarkar feels sorry that Superstition should hold its sway
in our land even during the twentieth century. He observes :
“ We have allowed the Britishers to crush everything that was
with us, but not that precious possession of ours ‘ Our
credulous superstition ’ ! ” “ Let an earthquake occur, public
prayer is our remedy. Let a patriot suffer from sickness, we
go to attend a crowded prayer-meeting. Let a pestilence
ravage our land, and we kill goats in sacrifice to ward off the
calamity. It was quite all right when we did not know the
causes of such things, but to stick to these superstitions even</p>
<p>RATIONALIST AND AUTHOR 183</p>
<p>when science has revealed the causes of such calamities is
simply absurd,” wrote Savarkar some years ago.</p>
<p>Savarkar asks the Hindus to follow the cause and effect
theory tiiat is never disturbed by the thought of Divine
pleasure or displeasure. He points out to the people that
water boils at a certain temperature and God never interferes
in this process ! Oxygen and Hydrogen combined in proper
proportions, are bound to yield water any day of the year
whether God wills it or not ! He proceeds : “ With the aid
of science, even Godless Fnssia is actually floating castles in
the air in the form of aeroplanes and giant super-fortresses.”
“ What actually matters is scientific accuracy and not
Astrological superstition. Astrology cannot save what .science
has doomed and where safety is assured by science, Astrology
cannot endanger it,” he observes, in his brilliant article
entitled, ‘ Machine is a boon to Mankind.’</p>
<p>Savarkar tells the people that it is time for them to realize
that ‘ Sacrifice ’ cannot bring rains, nor can it avert a famine.
He appeals to the Hindus to discard the superstitious and
religious aspect clinging to their usages regarding maternity
and asks them to send their women to well-equipped, well-
lighted, modern maternity homes instead of galling them in
dark, dingy and smoky rooms. He suggests that the corpses
should be carried in a car in a decent manner and burnt with
electricity.</p>
<p>Such a lover of science was bound to condemn the anti-
machine attitude of Gandhism with its charkha fads. To
Savarkar a telescope is a human eye with its capacity of vision
increased a thousand times ; a telephone is but a human ear
with an enormous increase in its power.</p>
<p>“ Machine has made man stay beneath water, rise high up
in the sky. Machine has made man far-reaching, far-seeing,
far-speaking and far-hearing. Machine has conferred upon man
blessings which no prophets could give or no penance could
secure. Mcuikind owes its present civilization entirely to the
use of machine, and thus machine far from being a curse, is
a wonderful boon which has bestowed supernatural powers
upon this hiunan race ! ” observes Savarkar. He appeals to
the nation that it is the duty of every thinking man to press</p>
<p>184 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>the cause of science in every department of life. Without
it, no nation can hope to survive the present stage, he adds.</p>
<p>To Savarkar science by itself is not responsible for the evils
of Capitalism or the destructive orgy of modern war technique.
It is the fault of the ways of distribution, lust for domination,
and greed for exploitation. Electricity can light a bulb or
detonate a bomb for the destruction of a city. Savarkar says
that the evil should be checked. In short, not warfare but
welfare of humanity should be the ultimate goal of science.</p>
<p>Savarkar stands for science and absolute science. He stands
for TODAY and not for the blind traditions of yesterday. He
appeals to the Hindus to test all their ancient holy works on
the touchstone of science. He writes ; “ We do not regard
the ancient works as all-pervading, omniscient and perfect by
themselves. The Smritis and the Vedas we love reverentially,
not as omniscient and unchangeable works, but as historical
books and as the landmarks in the great and glorious journey
of the human race.” He asks the Hindus, therefore, to test
the knowledge in the ancient holy works, their laws and
learnings on the touchstone of science and to follow fearlessly
what contributes to the good of the nation.</p>
<p>To Savarkar no animal is Divine. Even the cow is meant
for man ; not man for the cow. Not cow-worship but cow-
protection is our national asset. He denounces the viewpoint
of the Hindu leaders of the past, who, for saving the lives of
a handful of cows, lost their kingdoms, their human rights,
and their all. He, therefore, observes that if it is inevitable
in a grave crisis to live upon beef and save human lives in
India, the Hindus should also do it. The prosperity of a
nation does not depend upon its capacity for penance and
yoga, love of justice, or sense of virtue. History is replete
with innumerable instances, he writes, which show that the
wicked, cruel, unjust, and inhuman kings, conquerors,
democracies and republics have smothered the weak kings
and powerless democracies, though the victims were just,
human and non-aggressive. Discipline, dry gunpowder, the
range of guns, the edge of swords and an unflinrbing will are
the factors that protect the rights and liberties of a nation.
Justice and injustice have no relation to victory or defeat.
Victory and defeat are quite different from justice and</p>
<p>RATIONALIST AND AUTHOR 185</p>
<p>injustice. If victory and defeat have at all any relation with any
other thing, it is ^&lsquo;alour, observes Savarkar. But this worship
of strength, power and discipline, Savarkar say.s, should not
be used for aggressive and greedy aims. He slates that
justice, if weak, is futile and lame. It goes under. Injustice,
if powerful, tramples upon it.</p>
<p>These rational views of Savarkar have impressed many
pei&rsquo;sons and leaders of socialist and communist leanings. They
acknowledge this Savarkar to be the rationalist leader of
Maharashtra. In fact, in the domain of realism, rationalism and
revolutionism Savarkar has surpassed Ranade, Tilak, Agarkar
and Dr. Ketkar, the giant thinkers of Maharashtra. Sri S. K.
Kshirsagar, an eminent and fairly unbiased literary critic in
Maharashtra, observes that Maharashtra produced two great
leaders of ‘ Thought.’ They were Savarkar, and Dr. Ketkar,
the compiler of Marathi Dnyanakosh. “ Savarkar’s matchless
heroism,” he writes, “ and ideal patriotism had won a name
and fame even before the transportation of Tilak to Mandalay.
But Savarkar’s all-pervading political philosophy became
known after Tilak’s death. Though Tilak was revolutionary
in action, his thoughts on history, social philosophy, and poli-
tics were not as deep-rooted, fundamentally revolutionary and
volcanic as those of Savarkar.” ’ When a leader is accepted,
Kshirsagar goes on, people have to change their entire line
of thought, and Maharashtra learnt this for the first time in
history from the leadership of Savarkar. Telling that Savar-
kar was the first and foremost ‘ leader of thought ’ of Modern
Maharashtra who gained a wide following, Kshirsagar further
remarks that had Savarkar’s followers been truer to his
philosophy than to its mere glorification, a far greater cult
than that of the Sikhs or the Arya Samaj would have sprung
up cdl over India in the form of Savarkarism. The critic’s
assessment is rather a little pessimistic and less detached.
Pioneers of a great cause, precursors of a revolution and
prophets of a new order have never prospered in their own
age !</p>

<p>SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>As a man of letters Savarkar has no equal in Maharashtra.
There never was a greater genius born since the days of the
author of Dnyaneshwari in the land of the Mahrattas. Like
a cloud, Savarkar is myriad-sided. He is a volcanic writer,
a heroic author, a renaissance scholar, a historian in action, a
dramatist, a novelist and an epic poet whose genius earns
him a place among the first few greatest geniuses of our
Motherland. His creative genius is versatile and has the force
and flow of the Ganges and the effluence of a volcano. There
is grandeur of the Gaurishank2u-, the sweep of an eagle, pro-
fundity of the ocean and the flash of lightning in all his
writings. The pen and tongue of no other Indian author and
orator have been so entirely devoted to the nation’s cause as
those of Savarkar. His literature fills the reader with hope
and courage. It inspires the patriot, stimulates the thinker
and drives the soldier to fight for justice, liberty and welfare
of humanity. What is more, his is the only pen that has
suckled a line of martyrs, an unparalleled phenomenon in
Indian literature ! To Savarkar nothing is better, higher and
holier than this noble human work of uplifting his fellowmen
in this holy Hindusthan.</p>
<p>Sri G. T. Madkholkar, an ex-President of the Marathi
Literary Conference, well-known critic and at present editor
of the Tarun Bharat, Nagpur, in one of his memorable articles
remarks that during the last seventy-five years, Maharashtra
produced eight writers worth the name who possessed great
imaginative power, viz. Chiplunkar, Paranjpe, Shripad
Krishna, Achyutrao Kolhatkar, Kelkar, Gadkari, Atre and
Khandekar. Of these, he says, Chiplunkar and Paranjpe are
the only two writers whose imagination is of the classic type.
Savarkar, he says, belongs to this classic type. The critic goes
on ; “ The imagination of Savarkar is not as playful and
charming as the butterfly ; it has the sublime sweep of an
eagle. It has not the playfulness of a spring ; it has the depth
of the sea. It has not the delicacy of a creeping flowering-
plant ; it has the blazing power of lightning.” One more
quality and by no means a less important quaUty of Savarkar’s
imagination has escaped the notice of this eminent critic. It</p>
<p>RATIONALIST AND AUTHOR 187</p>
<p>is that Savarkar’s imagination is not devoid of realism.
Savarkar’s imaginative power is not aimless and unbridled.
It soars to the height of the Everest, but is not lost in the
clouds ! It has wings powerful enough to come down to the
earth. In this Savarkar outshines his two rivals, Chiplunkar
and Paranjpe.</p>
<p>In the domain of propaganda by literature no Indian writer
excels Savarkar. Pointing &lsquo;it that the literary productions
of Savaikar are dominatea . &gt;• vigour, sublimity and idealism,
Sii Madkholkar writes ; . a -arkar’s idealism in both these</p>
<p>respect.s — complete indepeudr ice of India and the resurrec-
tion of the Hindus — is to be called uncommon for the simple
reason that none else has so fearlessly advocated the cause of
independence and nobody has so comprehensively preached
for the resurrection of the Hindu race. It seems that his
fighting temperament is not prepared to take note of the limi-
tations, possibilities, or proprieties. The result is that w’hat-
ever ideal he advocates assumes so intensely propagandistic
and challenging a form that his writings are surcharged with
the spirit of a battle-cry.” In this, Sri N. C. Kelkar agrees
with Sri Madkholkar. Describing Savarkar as a man of art,
Kelkar says : “ Delicacy, so inherent in art, is not apparent
in Savarkar. Like the American author, Upton Sinclair, or
Norris, Savarkar possesses all the force of a propagandist and
is a straight hitter. He could hardly be excelled as a propa-
gandist by anyone else in Maharashtra ! Whatever subject
he chooses, may it be the purification of the Marathi language,
or the purification of the converts, the reform of the script,
or the reformation of the society, he will come out like one
pouncing for a battle-field with sword in hand.” Kelkar
proceeds : “ A Spartan general advised his soldier, ‘ if your
sword is shorter than that of your rival, always march a step
in advance.’ But Savarkar’s sword is longer in the first
instance and he himself stands a step in advance of others.”
Kelkar concludes : “ All the writings of Savarkar are like
leaps through arches fixed with knives and blazing torches
turned inside.”</p>
<p>Presiding over a literary function in Bombay in 1943, a
renowned novelist of Maharashtra remarked that Savarkar’s
pen had the force of the combined pens of the trio : Agarkar,</p>
<p>188 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Chiplunkar and Tilak. And indeed it is so ! Chiplunkar.
Agarkar and Tilak, all were spirited writers. All were virile.
They all had a ready pen. But while Agarkar wrote with his
dry intellect like a giant. Chiplunkar wrote like a proud
Pope, and Tilak wrote like a leader-general. Savarkar, how-
ever, wrote like a learned rationalist and a warrior-prophet !
Savarkar is master both of thought and word. His writings
ripple with human emotions and masculine force. He over-
whelms you with a well-drilled army of arguments. He
thrusts the kripan of reason through the shield of falsehood,
treachery, superstition and hypocrisy. But the most un-
rivalled characteristic of Savarkar’s excellence is that he
carries his great learning easily and writes with genius and
judgment. His perspicuity is peculiar ; his insight rare ! No
other pen has caused such a social upheaval with the violence
of spring-tides as did the volcanic pen of this man. He has
lashed his social opponents with a hard rod of rationalism
and crushed their opposition. His rationabstic articles on
‘ The Machine,’ ‘ God or Gunpowder,’ ‘ God of Man and Lord
of the Universe,’ ‘Woman’s place in Manusmriti,&rsquo; ‘Woman’s
Beauty and Duty ’ and his biting pungent articles on ‘ the
Cow ’ will easily rank him amongst the greate.st social
reformers of the world.</p>
<p>During his internment at Ratnagiri besides the several
articles mentioned above, he wrote his famous book ‘ Hindu
Pad-Padashahi ’ which is a history of the Rise and Fall of the
Mahratta Empire. Read in conjunction with Ranade’s Rise
of the Maratha Power, this book gives you the full nationa-
listic and broad view of the great national movement of the
Mahratta Hindus. It was a righteous war for the liberation
of the Hindus against the theocratic patriotism, fanatic fury,
volcanic greed and foreign domination of the Muslims. In this
book Savarkar depicts in his authoritative tone the glorious
spectacle of the rising Mahrattas, their insatiable central
desire, and their inordinate love for re-establishing for the
Hindus Swadharma and Swaraj, the God-given rights of Man.
The book reveals Savarkar’s master-intellect, true insight,
stately diction, great thought, and honest pride.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting parallel ! Both Savarkar and Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru wrote history. Both are great personalities.</p>
<p>RATIONALIST ANO AUTHOR 189</p>
<p>Nehru wrote for fame and glory. Savarkar wrote for the
nation. Both wrote thar histories with vigour, vivacity and
told their sl&rsquo;iries nobly and splendidly. While Nehru is a man
of immense reading Savarkar is a man of profound knowledge.
Savarkar wrote with astounding originality and much philo-
sophy while Nehru wrote with little originality and no philo-
sophy. Nehru lavishes praise on his heroes and lashes at
others. Savarkar inspires the nation and hammers out false
gods. But Nehru and Savarkar, the historians, differ on the
vital issues of the Indian History. In his Glimpses of World
History Nehru gets a perv erted vision of Shivaji’s action in
kiUing Afzulkhan. Neliru’.s angle of vision could misrepresent
the most vital crisis in the life of the greatest Indian of his
age. That angle of vision expressed surprise in his Discovery
of hidia that Jayachand is looked upon almost as a traitor, that
Hinduism was a national religion, and that Pratap regarded
Akbar, the hero of Pandit Nehru, as an alien. To Savarkar,
the historian, Jayachand is synonjrmous with a traitor, Akbar
a symbol of foreign domination and Pratap a nation-builder.
Have you heard Savarkar, the historian, on Chitor, Panipat,
and 1857 ? Have you come across any History of England
that does not contain the words Trafalgar and Waterloo ?
Have you come across any History of India without the men-
tion of Chitor ? Behold, it is Nehru’s Discovery of India.</p>
<p>Another great book Savarkar wrote during his internment
is My Transportation for Life. It is the most convincing and
inspiring work which depicts his jail life in the Andamans.
If five books that will last as long as the Marathi language
lasts, are selected, this stately and inspiring book will be one
of them along with Dnyanadeva’s Dnyaneshwari, Tukaram’s
Gatha, Tilak’s Gita Rahasya and Apte’s novel But who pays
Heed ? Leading critics in Mahai&rsquo;ashtra are of opinion that
this book of Savarkar would occupy a prominent place among
the great classics of the world. Again a great parallel. Pandit
Nehru wrote a great autobiography. In his mundane way,
Nehru’s autobiography is vigorous and glorious, but greatly
pompous and partly spiteful.</p>
<p>Savarkar’s My Transportation for Life, a part of his incom-
plete autobiography, is splendid, inspiring, ingenuous and
stately. Nehru is bristling with views and vanity, while</p>
<p>190 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Savarkar is bleeding with a serene thought and majestic heart.
If the full epic autobiography of Savarkar and the great roman-
tic life story of M. N. Roy had appeared in the field by now,
India would have shone in the domain of world auto-
biographies with two immortal autobiographies. This
Savarkar ’s book was translated into Gujarati and somehow
was proscribed by the alien Government egged on by native
machinations. And though on the advent of the Congress
Ministry the inspiring book escaped the literary genius of
Sri K. M. Munshi, the then Home Minister of Bombay, it wa.s
released by Sri Morarji Desai in a straightforward, patriotic
and fearless manner when he became the Home Minister of
Bombay.</p>
<p>As a dramatist, Savarkar did not care so much for a plot
or stage effect. Here the playwright lives the life of his
‘ self speaking and acting through his characters. His
characters move with emotion and reason. Humour is some-
times uncommon to genius, and Savarkar is no exception to
it. Still all the three plays of Savarkar written during his
internment are wonderfully effective. The Usshap paves the
way and struggles for the well-being and welfare of the
Depressed Classes and strives to bury untouchability.
Written on the background of Lord Buddha’s life, Sanyasta
Khadga — the Forsaken Sword — is a devastating commentary
on the doctrine of absolute non-violence, and preaches that
relative non-violence is a virtue. This play removes the web of
absolute non-violence, and ends in showing that not the saint,
but the sword protects the hearths and homes of a nation
against the aggre.ssive forces in the world. Some of the
characters from this drama non-violently enough do not ‘ cut ’
jokes, because the word ‘ cut ’ implies violence ! Dr. N. B.
Khare as a staunch Congressman saw this play staged in
Nagpur in the early thirties. As the play advanced and the
guns of philosophy of the struggle for existence began to
boom, Dr. Khare grew animated and to the amazement of
the audience sprang upon the stage with dramatic suddenness
and shouted ; “ Friends, countrymen, our country at present
needs some one to preach this philosophy.” This drama ends
in a tragedy. Clear was the object ! A slave country must
accustom itself to the spirit of tragedy. Uttarakriya, the</p>
<p>RATIONALIST AND AUTHOR 191</p>
<p>third play of Savarkar, deals with the post-Panipat period of
the Mahratta history.</p>
<p>Savarkar wrote two novels, the Moplah Rebellion and the
Transportation. The first is short, succinct and sweet with a
subtle charm and satire. Originally published in Babarao
Savarkar’s name — ^for Savarkar was then passing his days in
internment — , the novel was acclaimed to be the best from the
viewpoint of the ideal theme for a novel, by a front rank
Marathi columnist, although he expressed his belief that the
novel was written by Babarao Savarkar, which was not a
fact. As the colummist w as a critic of Savarkar and often
ungenerous, his opinion about the novel should be doubly
acceptable. The second novel has a thrilling background of
the magic of the Andamans, and according to some film
journals, it would be a great and thrilling screen version, if
reproduced.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>As for the role of women in life, Savarkar has definite views
to offer. He believes that there is a fundamental and natural
difference between man and woman. Their duties are
different. So their education, too, must necessarily differ.
Reformer as he is, he does not like women to obey the dictates
of old useless customs.</p>
<p>Savarkar regards female education indispensable to the
uplift of a nation ; but by female education he does not
necessarily mean university degrees, although he has no
objection to their obtaining the degrees without disregarding
their primary duty to the home, children, and the nation. He
holds that a system of education must be drawn up on new
lines, and women should be given some sort of specialized
training congenial to the temperament of women. A woman
should be a ministering angel rather than a masculine Amazon
or a Virago. She should imbibe the quality of her proverbial
modesty and grace rather than mere eloquence or proficiency
in mathematics. Women are the solace and comfort of heartlis
and homes. The larger the number of good healthy mothers,
he observes, the stronger and healthier will be the nation.
Therefore, a woman’s education should enable her to enrich</p>
<p>192 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>the nation with a generation stronger, more beautiful, and
more patriotic than the past. The Russian woman is on an
equal footing with man. Yet, does it mean, he asks, that
Stalin delivers a child instead of his wife ?</p>
<p>To Savarkar life is an oblation. According to him a woman
should look beautiful with her natural charms and try to keep
it with good aids to beauty. In addition, he has something
to say to a beauty about her duty ! Beauty is handed over
to her, he warns, as a strict sacred trust. And that trust is
eugenics. A beautiful woman who fails to fulfil this conditi(;n
becomes morally guilty of a breach of trust. A nation that
strives to have daughters more beautiful than their mothers
and sons stronger than their fathers necessarily adds to artistic
culture handed down to it through heritage ! Is this not the
angle and approach of a realist, a rationalist, and a reformer ?
Years after Savarkar wrote this, we find today England,
France and other European countries propagating these very
doctrines to arrest the decrease in population in their countries
and to avoid the consequential downfall and decay of the
virility of their nations.</p>

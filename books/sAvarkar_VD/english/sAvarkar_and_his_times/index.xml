      <description>Swatantryaveer Savarkar needs no introduction to the Indian public, neither does his biography. Long ago, Mr. Asaf Ali described Savarkar as the spirit of Shivaji and the late Sri Srinivas Sastri said of him that “ he was a great and fear- less patriot and volumes could be written about his yeoman services in the cause of Indian Freedom.” This is, however, too small a volume to describe that spirit and those services adequately.</description>

      <description>I
In politically fallen, socially degraded and financially ruined Hindusthan, the eighteen-eighties and nineties witnessed the darkest period in the history of our country. The first peep of the dawn in the form of the refonns of 1909 was still to come. The dawn of 1919 was beyond the horizon. The spiritual planets like Maharshi Ranade, Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda were kindling light of social regeneration and spiritual heritage.</description>

      <description>1
Savarkar passed his Mati’iculation Examinatiou in Decem- ber 1901, and left Nasik for Poona in January 1902. What was the state of Poona ? Exactly a year before Poona had lost Mahadeo Govind Ranade, India’s foremost torchbearer of learning and light. Ranade was a great social reformer, a towering scholar, an ardent patriot, a renowned thinker, an eminent economist and an exemplary judge. He was the foremost torchbearer of a new age, and wished to build a social structure conforming to the demands of fresh ideas.</description>

      <description>I
The year 1906 was a landmark in Indian politics. During this year Savarkar, the leader of the Abhinava Bharat, went to London. That year saw the birth of the Muslim League at Dacca. The formation of Barindranath’s revolutionai&amp;rsquo;y party at Maniktola, a suburb of Calcutta, and the foundation of the revolutionary institution, the Anushilan Samiti, took place during the same year.
With a band of a few hundred youths at his command in Maharashtra, Savarkar left India.</description>

      <description>I
The Abhinava Bharat was pondering over the sentences passed upon the Maniktola revolutionaries. Babarao Savar- kar’s heroic sacrifice blazed vigorously under the sacrificial firmament. The boiling point of British reaction was reached. The zero hour had struck. And Sir Curzon Wyllie, the brain and eye of Indian affairs at the India House, fell a victim to the bullets of Madanlal Dhingra on the first night of July 1909. Along with him also fell Dr.</description>

      <description>I
On the first day of July 1910, the steamer s.s, morea convey- ing Savarkar to India started on her historic voyage from London ! Proud like a kite, she held her prey in the clutches. She tossed on. But woe followed the waves. The book of fate was signed and sealed by destiny ! There was some engine trouble and the morea required repairs in the neigh- bourhood of the port of Marseilles.</description>

      <description>I
With a blanket on his head and a platter in one hand, Savarkar stood in chains before the ferocious lofty gates deco- rated with all kinds of chains, hand-cuffs, fetters, guns and bayonets. The gate creaked ! Someone whispered that Mr. Barrie was coming on. Savarkar was preoccupied and was not conscious of Barrie’s arrival. A voice roared, “ Leave him. He is not a tiger ! ” The harsh voice waked Savarkar up.</description>

      <description>I In his utter helplessness and colossal frustration of life Savarkar was striving superhumanly to wring some good out of it. A true ascetic and man of action as he was, he resolved to make the most of life and to make the best of it. Such men of supreme courage and indomitable mil make appearance from age to age. Stone walls do not imprison them, nor do iron bars encage them.</description>

      <description>1
The World War I terminated in 1918 and soon after a systematic and persistent propaganda was carried on through- out the country for the release of all political prisoners. People, popular leaders and the Press voiced their demand for the release of political prisoners through petitions, meet- ings, Conferences, Congress Sessions and in Coimcils. The National Union of Bombay, Sri Anantrao Gadre, Senapati Bapat and Sri Shivrampant Paranjpe took a leading part in collecting signatures of the people on the petition and the great petition was forwarded to Mr.</description>

Thus Savarkar was interned in Ratnagiri where the defeated and dethroned King Theba of Burma had perished. Two weeks after this memorable event of January 6, 1924, the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha was established ostensibly through the influence and attempts of Babarao Savarkar, but, in fact, inspired by Savarkar himself. The main object of the Sabha was to organize, consolidate and unite the Hindus into one organic whole and enable them to oppose effectively any unjust aggression ; thus while protecting their own cultural, religious and economic rights, the Hindus were to strive for the general welfare of mankind, universal compassion being the basic urge of Hinduism !</description>

Modern civilization is th» atcome of scientific research and progress. Science and Der io^racy are two great potential forces in the modern wo) d Democracy defines the shape and aims of social and political endeavour. It strives for a good, just, equitable and progressive life. Good and progressive life demands an equal and proportionately just enjoyment of all the material and cultural resources and possession.

Savarkar’s dramatic release was a pleasant surprise to Hindudom. Leaders like Sri Kelkar, Bhai Parmananda, Dr. Moonje and Sri Aney were happy over the exhilarating event that brought to them the release of a national force. The reaction of the Congress High Command to his release was notable. Pandit Nehru welcomed Savaikar back to freedom. Rajaji felt great joy at the release of a national hero, who was to him a symbol of courage, bravery and patriotism.</description>

The ideal and ideology which Sav£irkar laid down and propagated is called the Hindu Sanghatan ideology or Hindu Nationalism or Savarkarism. Although a natural development, an outgrowth and a manilestation of the various views and tenets upheld by several Hindu nationalists jointly, severally or individually, the ideology is put into a form and finally formulated and codified into an integrated doctrine of social and political outlook on life by Savarkar.</description>

      <description>I
Owing to their stupendous ignorance of and a wrong approach to the Moslem problem, the Congress leaders betrayed a woeful lack of self-confidence in the conduct of the national struggle. This ultimately discredited the prestige and patriotism of the Hindus, undermined the pov/er of the national majority, and mortgaged the destiny of the country to the anti-national forces.
Savarkar’s insight perceived this growing danger from the designs of the awakened Muslim mind.</description>

Meantime, there was a move in tlie Liberal Circles to solve the deadlock in their way. They held a Non-Party
Conference in March 1941 at the Taj Malial Hotel, Bombay. The Convener of the Conference was the late Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.

The Akhand Hindusllian movement was gradually gaining ground. Savarkar’s voi. was capturing the imagination of the people. Congress iri&amp;rsquo;u- nce with the ma.sses was at a low ebb. Even in Englan-i and in America the people and the Press evinced interest and eagerness to learn more about the Hindu Mahasabha and its movement, its organiza- tion and its leaders. The Hindu Mahasabha was defeating Congress candidates in Municipal, Local and District Local Board elections and bye-elections to the Legislatures.</description>

Now we come to a very important chapter in the life of Savarkar. By now Rajaji, the whilom member of the All- India Congress Committee, released to the press his corres- pondence with Mr. Jinnah concerning his offer to the League leader which was fathered by Gandhiji during his fast at the Aga Kh^n Palace. Rajaji had now advanced to the far end of the proposed Pakistan scheme. Speaking on the birthday anniversary of the Prophet at Bangalore on April 12, 1943, Rajaji had said : “ I stand for Pakistan because I do not want that State where we Hindus and Muslims are both not honoured.</description>

The act was committed in broad daylight, in a public place, in the sight of a multitude by a man dressed in khaki bush jacket and blue trousers.

The story of Savarkar is the history of resistance, strife, struggle, sufferings and sacrifices for the cause of political, social and economic emai^cipation of this Bharat Varsha. His is a political career extended over fifty long years. How many of his great contemporaries could see pioneers from Ranade to philosophers like M. N. Roy, could strive for inde- pendence of India and yet have the good fortune to see the sun of freedom rise over India ?</description>

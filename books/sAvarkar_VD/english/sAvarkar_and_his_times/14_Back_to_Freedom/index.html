  <p>In spite of his heroic work in the direction of social and
mental revolution thi^oughout the period of internment at
Ratnagiri, Savarkar was trying his utmost to break his
shackles. Gnveriimeni wt c trying their way to prolong the
period of his internment oi some plea or other. It is said that
climate influences characteis Inhabitants as they were of a
region where fire is a luxury, the Britishers took great care
of fire wherever it burnt in their Indian Empire. They
watched the fire-places in India with special care. Whenever
any fire broke out in any part of India, Savarkar &rsquo;s
residence was shadowed. Surprise * raids were a common
feature for Savarkar’s residence. Once the Superintendent
of Police surrounded Savarkar’s residence at dawn, and
showed Savarkar the order under which he was directed to
search Savarkar’s residence for copies of the proscribed book,
The Indian War of Independence of 1857. Savarkar came out
of the house with his family and said to the officer with a
smile : “ Yes, we have come out. You can go in and search the
house. But remember that I have struggled with Scotland
Yard for four years and outwitted them.” Yet the police had
not come to Savarkar’s residence without reason. Sardar
Bhagat Singh had printed two thousand copies of that famous
book of Savarkar to raise funds for his revolutionary society
and had respectfully sent the first two copies of the book to
Savarkar.</p>
<p>On another occasion Savarkar was almost perplexed. The
C.I.D. and police officers surprised him. But gifted with a
marvellous presence of mind, he waited till the search was
over and at last when the time for the report came, he handed
over to the officer the very writing pad which contained an
article ready for the press. The police officer used it without
peeping inside while Savarkar held a crumbled piece of paper
containing a poem on Sardar Bhagat Singh.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>194 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>To supplement his heroic efforts and express his views
unobserved on current politics, Savarkar then patronised a
weekly named Shraddhananda edited by his brother, Dr, N,
D. Savarkar, in Bombay. It published several inspiring
articles by Savarkar. Though the articles did not appear in
the name of Savarkar, Maharashtra could feel the inspiring
touch and tone ; and in a short time this weekly attained
enormous popularity and had a wide circulation. Gandhiji
had just then begun to come out of his virtual retirement.
The Madras Session of the Indian National Congress passed
a resolution demanding absolute political independence.
Gandhiji dubbed it childish. Savarkar showed his great
jubilation thi-ough the weekly, and bitterly criticised the
attitude of Gandhiji towards that resolution.</p>
<p>Condolence meetings in memory of Swami Shraddhananda,
who was cruelly inurdered by a fanatic Muslim, in memory
of Deshbandhu Das and Lala Lajpat Rai, were addressed by
Savarkar before sighing multitudes at Ratnagiri.</p>
<p>At this juncture there was a move to elect Savarkar as
President of the Hindu Mahasabha at its Jubbulpore Session
in 1927, but it was not successful. Referring to this proposal,
Sri N. C. Kelkar who presided over the Session, began his
Presidential Address with these words : The Reception</p>
<p>Committee, I learn, had adverted to the possibility of getting
Mr. Vinayakrao Savarkeir to preside over this Conference,
and I share their regret and disappointment in the failure of
their object.” ^ During these days a prominent Congressman
of Maharashtra suggested Savarkar&rsquo;s name for the president-
ship of the Indian National Congress and wrote that in the
event of Savarkar’s absence, his Address should be read out
by installing a portrait of Savarkar in the presidential chair.
Not only this, it was even suggested that Savarkar should
represent the Congress at the Round Table Conference.^</p>
<p>The Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha was the first organized Hindu
Body which came forward to back up Dr. Moonje in his
acceptance of the invitation to the Round Table Conference
and in January 1931 passed a resolution “ expressing apprecia-
tion of the ability and courage with which Moonje and Jayakai*</p>
<ul>
<li>N. C. Kelkar, Speeches and Writings, p. 301,</li>
</ul>
<p>2 Quoted in the Pratihha, dated 15-1-1936.</p>
<p>BACKTOFREEOOM 195</p>
<p>had defended the Hindu cause, which it was declared, was
identical with the cause of India as a whole against the
anti-national encroachments of the Moslems.” The resolution
further threw a challenge to the Moslems to accept an
arbitration by the League of Nations. It added that the
rejection of the arbitration offer by the Muslims exposed the
unjust nature of their claims.</p>
<p>In 1934 Savarkar was arrested again and detained for two
weeks in connection v/ith -bots fired at some military officer
in Bombay by Sri Wau.anrao Chavan, a Sanghatanist
firebrand from Ratnagir . Jovcrmnent, however, could
establish nothing and Savarkar was released on the 15th day.</p>
<p>Government went on extending the period of Savarkar’s
internment from time to time — 1929 to 1937 — as they
considered him a danger to the peace of India. In the last
week of October 1930, the Bombay Government instructed
Mr. D. Simington, District Magistrate of Ratnagiri, to give
his opinion as to whether, having regard to Savarkar’s
antecedents and to the then political situation, he considered
that the restrictions imposed on Savarkar should be either
wholly or partly withdrawn without danger.</p>
<p>The District Magistrate, Mr. D. Simington, is reported to
have opined that in the then state of politics Savarkar should
not be released. He ako reported to Government that
Savarkar had devoted himself to the removal of untouchabilitj'
and had achieved a certain measure of success, and added
that he had successfully admitted the untouchables to the
new Patit Pavan Temple. It was a bad recommendation, but
a gentleman’s appreciation of Savarkar’s social work. Are
there any impartial souk now in power who are frank enough
to admit what the Englkhman wrote secretly ? In 1934
Mr. R. M. Maxwell, Secretary to the Government of Bombay,
declined Savarkar’s request for permission to go to Bombay
to attend the Bombay City and Suburbs Hindu Sabha
Conference which was held in Bombay on the 23rd and 24th
of January 1934. But whenever he was allowed to go out
of Ratnagiri City or Dktrict, secret wires clicked in code
words from Ratnagiri to all important police headquarters of
Bombay, Poona, and other cities. And every Dktrict
Magistrate in the province tried his utmost to avoid Savarkar’s</p>
<p>196 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>presence in his District by complaining to the Home
Department that his presence in the District would
tremendously increase the work of the police and other
departments. * *</p>
<p>Years rolled on and at long last the day of release arrived.
After fighting the Provincial elections under the new Act of
1935 and almost unchallenged by any major political opposition
for the Hindu seats, the Congressmen were hatching the eggs
of ministership under the wings of Gandhiji ! Govei’nment
were eager to have interim ministries in the provinces with a
view to pressing the Congress to accept office. In the interim
period of the deadlock Khan Bahadur Dhanjishaw Cooper,
with the support of Sri Jamnadas M. Mehta, a representative
of the Tilakite Democratic Swaraj Party, e.vpressed his
willingness to form an interim Ministry in the Province on
one condition. Mehta had been a champion of the campaign
for Savarkar’s release for a number of years in the past. He
made Savarkar&rsquo;s release a condition precedent to accepting
the office. H.E. Lord Brabourne, the then Governor of
Bombay, showed his willingness to release Savarkar subject
to good behaviour. Mehta’s repartee at once resolved the
bracket of the condition ! Mehta said that the Governor
himself and even the speaker himself were free citizens subject
to good behaviour, in fact any citizen in any country was so.
Then the Governor’s telephone murmured between London
and Bombay, between Bombay and Simla and to the great
relief of Hindusthan, Savarkar was at very long last released
unconditionally on the 10th of May 1937, the 10th of May, the
red letter day in the Indian history on which the first War
of Independence started.</p>
<p>To have released one of the greatest political prisoners of
the world, to have set free the greatest revolutionary leader of
India and the noblest son of Mother India was no common
achieventent for Sri Jamnadas.</p>
<p>Several functions were held in Ratnagiri in honour of
Savarkar’s release. At one of these functions Sri M. D. Joshi,
a prominent Congressman expressed his view that Savarkar
was also one of the doctors of the nation and would prescribe
for the ills of the nation. Whatever party Savarkar might
join, he would add to the freedom movement and welfare of</p>
<p>BACKTO FREEDOM 197</p>
<p>the country, added the speaker. A purse was presented to
Savarkar by the citizens of Ratnagiri. In hi.'- parting speech
Savarkar was moved with the memory of the social movements
in Ratnagiri. He said he was very sorry that due to his
mission there were divisions, heart-breakings and scuffles
among families and friends. Savarkar continued that he had
done it all in the best interest of the Country, God and Man.</p>
<p>As for the future, Savarkar said that the goal of
independence w^as to be attained by resistance, alliance and
pressure; that the ba.sic &lt;';il]ine of that independence should
be a ‘ one man one vote ’ d -*mocracy and that he would strive
for and achieve that goal not by sacrificing the just rights of
the Hindus. Whatever happened, he said, he would never
desert the cause of the Hindus. He would die as a Hindu
rather than prosper as an anti-Hindu soul, concluded Savarkar.
After his release Savarkar unfurled the tri-colour flag
reminiscent of the Abhinava Bharat emblem at the Ratnagiri
District Political Conference held under the presidentship of
Mr. K. F. Nariman. Political life and fight to begin after a
lapse and lull of full twenty-seven years !</p>
<p>But the India of those days was dominated by Gandhiji who
had literally thrown away into the waste paper ba.sket the
appeal for Savarkar’s release. When approached for his support
and signature to the appeal, Gandhiji said he did not know
who that Savarkar was, and asked whether he was the same
Savarkar who wrote The Indian War of Indepi 7idence of 1857,
and subsequently explained to the public that he thought it
derogatory to approach the British Government for the release
of Savarkar. Nehru went one step further. He was reported
to have torn non- violently the ‘ Release Savarkar ’
memorandum to pieces. And all this happened before
Savarkar had joined the Hindu Mahasabha as a political party
in opposition to the Congress. Coming events cast their
shadows before ! Let history record this fact which is
stranger than fiction !</p>

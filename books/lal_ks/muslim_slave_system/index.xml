      <description>PREFACE
In my book The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India, I had said that “It is not, pertinent here to make a detailed study of the Muslim slave system which was an institution as peculiar as it was unique.” A detailed study of the Muslim slave system in medieval India is being made here. In The Legacy I had also said that “the best way to understand the content and spirit of Muslim rule in India… is by going through Muslim scriptures (as) all medieval chroniclers were scholars of Muslim law.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Slavery is the system by which certain persons are kept as the property of others - a system of great antiquity and wide prevalence. Slavery originated during the age of savagery and continued into ancient civilizations. As Nieboer has said, “the taming of animals naturally leads to taming of men.” it is supposed that the nomadic herdsman who domesticated animals also began to domesticate, to enslave, men. Slavery was there in Babylon and elsewhere in Mesopotamia; it was widely prevalent in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, centuries before the coming of Christ.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIM SLAVE SYSTEM
From the day India became a target of Muslim invaders its people began to be enslaved in droves to be sold in foreign lands or employed in various capacities on menial and not-so-menial jobs within the country. To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to go into the origins and development of the Islamic system of slavery. For, wherever the Muslims went, mostly as conquerors but also as traders, there developed a system of slavery peculiar to the clime, terrain and populace of the place.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
ENSLAVEMENT OF HINDUS BY ARAB AND
TURKISH INVADERS
Turks were not the first Muslims to invade India. Prior to the coming of Turks the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim invaded Sindh in the early years of the eighth century. In conformity with the Muslim tradition, the Arabs captured and enslaved Indians in large numbers. Indeed from the days of Muhammad bin Qasim in the eighth century to those of Ahmad Shah Abdali in the eighteenth, enslavement, distribution, and sale of Hindu prisoners was systematically practised by Muslim invaders and rulers of India.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
SLAVE SULTANS OF HINDUSTAN
Slavery was wide-spread in Islam. The early Turkish invaders and rulers of India were slaves or scions of slaves. Mahmud of Ghazni was the son of a purchased slave, Subuktigin. Subuktigin in his turn had been bought by one Alptigin who himself was a purchased slave. Alptigin was the first Turkish slave-warrior-ruler who carried his arms into Hindustan. His career and resourcefulness are symbolic of the Turkish slaves as a whole.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
SLAVE-TAKING DURING MUSLIM RULE
Slavery forms an integral part of the history of Islam. The Turks practised it on a large scale before they entered India as invaders. Slaves were abducted or captured by marauders (Subuktigin, Balban), they were sold by jealous or needy relatives (Iltutmish), and they were purchased by slave-traders to be sold for profit (Aibak). These methods were known to Muslim rulers in India. All these and many other methods were employed by them and their nobles in making slaves in India.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
ENSLAVEMENT AND PROSELYTIZATION
Wherever the Muslims conquered - in West Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and India - there they made people slaves and converted them to Islam. In this mission they were most successful in Africa and the least in India.
At the advent of Islam, part of Arabia was under Abyssinian rule. When Arabia was Islamized, the tide turned and the Abyssinians came under the Arabs and they made slaves of Abyssinians and Ethiopians without much opposition.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
STRUGGLE FOR POWER AMONG SLAVE NOBLES
Abdulla Khan’s words were prophetic. The population of Indian Muslims grew rapidly through enslavement. This rapid growth gave rise to new problems. One was a tussle for power between foreign slave-Amirs and Indian slaves some of whom also attained to the position of nobles. As among the Turkish Amirs themselves, a bitter struggle for clout also raged between foreign Turks and Indian Muslims.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
EMPLOYMENT OF SLAVES
Muslim regime in medieval times drafted slaves in every sphere of activity. Slaves were needed in thousands for any large enterprise which, in modern technological age, would be accomplished by a few machines or even gadgets. There was no dearth of slaves either. Muslim victories in India had provided kings and nobles with innumerable slaves. From government affairs to domestic errands slaves were employed on every work.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
GHILMANS AND EUNUCHS
The treatment meted out to the slaves depended upon the temperament, whim and caprice of the master. Some masters were kind hearted and treated their slaves kindly, many others cruelly, a few abominably. But one class of slaves who were very well looked after were ghilman and mamalik. The eunuchs also, because of the nature of their duties, received sort of a special treatment.

      <description>CHAPTER X
SLAVE TRADE
It is nowhere mentioned in medieval chronicles how slaves, captured in war, were sorted out and separated for the purpose of being sold, drafted into the army, given as gifts to princes and nobles or set apart for domestic service. All that is known is that slaves were disposed of on all these counts and many more. It appears that the sorting was done on the basis of the looks of the females, physical fitness of the males, intuition of the master, as well as the specific work that a slave was deemed fit to do.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XI
RULES REGARDING MANUMISSION AND SALE OF SLAVES
It has been seen in the preceding pages that a very prominent feature of Muslim polity, society and economy in this country was its slave system. Muslim history throughout the country and indeed in this world is incomplete without its slaves. The two main sources of obtaining slaves were by capture and purchase. The two main means of their disposal were by manumission and sale.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XII
SEX SLAVERY
In the preceding pages it has been seen how women and children were special targets for enslavement throughout the medieval period, that is, during Muslim invasions and Muslim rule. Captive children of both sexes grew up as Muslims and served the sultans, nobles and men of means in various captives. Enslavement of young women was also due to many reasons; their being sex objects was the primary consideration and hence concentration on their captivity.</description>

      <description>POSTSCRIPT
We began by quoting Thomas Patrick Hughes to say that “slavery of Islam is interwoven with the Law of marriage, the Law of sale, and the Law of inheritance… and its abolition would strike at the very foundation of the code of Muhammadanism”.^(1) The statement holds as good today as in the early years of Islam. The rules of Islam remain the same for all time, for Islam is changeless and unchangeable.</description>

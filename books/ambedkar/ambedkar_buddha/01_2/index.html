<p>§ 1. From Kapilavatsu to Rajagraha</p>
<ol>
<li>Leaving Kapilavatsu, Siddharth Gautama thought of going to
Rajagraha, the capital of the kingdom of Magadha.</li>
<li>The reigning king was Bimbisara. It was a place which great
philosophers and leaders of thought had made their headquarters.</li>
<li>With this thought in mind he crossed the Ganges, fearing not
her rapid flow.</li>
<li>On his way he halted at the hermitage of a Brahmin woman, Saki,
then at the hermitage of another Brahmin woman, by name Padma, and
then at the hermitage of the Brahmin sage Raivata. All of them
entertained him.</li>
<li>Having seen his personality and dignity and his splendid
beauty, surpassing all other men, the people of that region were all
astonished at him [=his] wearing the clothes of a sanyasi.</li>
<li>On seeing him, he who was going elsewhere stood still, and he
who was standing there followed him on the way; he who was walking
gently and gravely ran quickly, and he who was sitting at once sprang
up.</li>
<li>Some people reverenced him with their hands, others in worship
saluted him with their heads, some addressed him with affectionate
words; not one went on without paying him homage.</li>
<li>Those who were wearing gay-coloured dresses were ashamed when
they saw him, those who were talking on random subjects fell to
silence; no one indulged in an improper thought.</li>
<li>His eyebrows, his forehead, his mouth,&ndash;his body, his hand, his
feet, or his gait,&ndash;whatever part of him anyone beheld, that at once
rivetted his gaze.</li>
<li>After a long and arduous journey Gautama reached Rajagraha
surrounded by five hills, well guarded and adorned with mountains, and
supported and hallowed by auspicious and sacred places.</li>
<li>On reaching Rajagraha he selected a spot at the foot of the
Pandava hill, and put up a small hut made of the leaves of trees for
his sojourn.</li>
<li>Kapilavatsu by foot is nearly 400 miles distant from
Rajagraha.</li>
<li>This long journey Siddharth Gautama did all on foot.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. King Bimbisara and his Advice</p>
<ol>
<li>Next day he got up and started to go into the city with a
begging bowl, asking for alms. A vast crowd gathered round him.</li>
<li>Then Sreniya Bimbisara, the lord of the kingdom of the
Magadhas, beheld from the outside of his palace the immense concourse
of people, and asked the reason of it; and thus did a courtier recount
it to him:</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who was thus foretold by the Brahmins, &lsquo;He will either
attain supreme wisdom or be the emperor of the earth&rsquo;&ndash;it is he, the
son of the king of the Sakyas, who is now an ascetic. It is he at whom
the people are gazing at.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king, having heard this and perceiving its meaning in his
mind, thus at once spoke to that courtier, &ldquo;Let it be known whither he
is going&rdquo;; and the courtier, receiving the command, followed the
prince.</li>
<li>With fixed eyes, seeing only a yoke&rsquo;s length before him, with
his voice hushed, and his walk slow and measured, he, the noblest of
mendicants, went begging for alms, keeping his limbs and his wandering
thoughts under control.</li>
<li>Having received such alms as were offered, he retired to a
lonely corner of the mountain; and having eaten it there, he ascended
the Pandava hill.</li>
<li>In that wood, thickly filled with <em>lodhra</em> trees, having its
thickness resonant with the notes of the peacocks, he, the sun of
mankind, shone, wearing his red dress, like the morning sun above the
eastern mountains.</li>
<li>That royal courtier, having thus watched him there, related it
all to the king; and the king, when he heard it, in his deep
veneration, started himself to go thither with a modest retinue.</li>
<li>Like a mountain in stature, the king ascended the hill.</li>
<li>There he beheld Gautama, resplendent as he sat on his hams,
with subdued senses, as if the mountain was moving, and he himself was
a peak thereof.</li>
<li>Him, distinguished by his beauty of form and perfect
tranquillity, filled with astonishment and affectionate regard, the
king of men approached.</li>
<li>Bimbisara having courteously drawn nigh to him, inquired as to
the condition of his bodily humours; and Gautama with equal gentleness
assured the king of his health of mind and freedom from all
ailments.</li>
<li>Then the king sat down on the clean surface of the rock, and
being seated, he thus spoke, desiring to convey his state of mind:</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have a strong friendship with thy family, come down by
inheritance and well proved; since from this, a desire to speak to
thee, my son, has arisen in me, therefore, listen to my words of
affection,</li>
<li>&ldquo;When I consider thy race, beginning with the sun, thy fresh
youth, and thy conspicuous beauty, I wonder whence comes this resolve
of thine, so out of all harmony with the rest, set wholly on a
mendicant&rsquo;s life, not on a kingdom?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thy limbs are worthy of red sandalwood perfumes,&ndash;they do not
deserve the rough contact of red cloth; this hand of thine is fit to
protect subjects, it deserves not to hold food given by another</li>
<li>&ldquo;If, therefore, gentle youth, thou desirest not thy paternal
kingdom, then in thy generosity, accept forthwith one half of my
kingdom.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If thou actest thus, there will be no sorrow caused to thine
own people, and by the mere lapse of time imperial power at last flies
for refuge to the tranquil mind; therefore, be pleased to do me this
kindness. The prosperity of the good becomes very powerful, when aided
by the good.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But if from thy pride of race thou dost not now feel
confidence in me, then plunge with thy arrows into countless armies,
and with me as thy ally seek to conquer thy foes.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Choose thou, therefore, one of these ends. Pursue according
to the rules of religious merit, wealth, and pleasure; pursue love and
the rest, in reverse order. These are the three objects in life; when
men die they pass into dissolution as far as regards this world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do thou, therefore, by pursuing the three objects of life,
cause this personality of thine to bear its fruit; they say that when
the attainment of religion, wealth and pleasure is complete in all its
parts, then the end of man is complete.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do not thou let these two brawny arms lie useless, which are
worthy to draw the bow; they are well fitted to conquer the three
worlds, much more the earth.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I speak this to you out of affection,&ndash;not through love of
dominion or through arrogance; beholding this mendicant-dress of
thine, I am filled with compassion, and I shed tears.</li>
<li>&ldquo;O, thou who desirest the mendicant&rsquo;s stage of life, enjoy
pleasures now, in due time&ndash;ere old age comes on and overcomes this
thy beauty, well worthy of thy illustrious race.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The old man can obtain merit by religion; old age is helpless
for the enjoyment of pleasures; therefore, they say that pleasures
belong to the young man, wealth to the middle-aged, and religion to
the old.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Youth in this present world is the enemy of religion and
wealth&ndash;since pleasures, however much we guard against them, are hard
to hold, therefore, wherever pleasures are to be found, there thy
youth [should] seize them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Old age is prone to reflection, it is grave and intent on
remaining quiet; it attains unimpassionedness with but little effort,
unavoidably, and for very shame.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore, having passed through the deceptive period of
youth, fickle, intent on external objects, heedless, impatient, not
looking at the distance,&ndash;they take breath like men who have escaped
safe through a forest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let, therefore, this fickle time of youth first pass by,
reckless and giddy,&ndash;our early years are earmarked for pleasure, they
cannot be kept from the power of the senses.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or, if religion is really thy one aim, then offer
sacrifices,&ndash;this is thy family&rsquo;s immemorial custom, climbing to
highest heaven by sacrifices.</li>
<li>&ldquo;With their arms pressed by golden bracelets, and their
variegated diadems resplendent with the light of gems, royal sages
have reached the same goal by sacrifice which great sages reached by
self-mortification.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Gautama Answers Bimbisara</p>
<ol>
<li>Thus spoke the monarch of the Magadhas, who spoke well and
strongly like Indra; but having heard it, the prince did not falter.
He was firm like a mountain.</li>
<li>Being thus addressed by the monarch of the Magadhas, Gautama,
in a strong speech with friendly face,&ndash;self-possessed, unchanged,
thus made answer:</li>
<li>&ldquo;What you have said is not to be called a strange thing for
thee. O King! Born as thou art in the great family whose ensign is the
lion, and lover as thou art of thy friends, that ye should adopt this
line of approach towards him who stands as one of thy friends is only
natural.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Amongst the evil-minded, a friendship worthy of their family
ceases to continue, and fades; it is only the good who keep increasing
the old friendship of their ancestors by a new succession of friendly
acts.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But those men who act unchangingly towards their friends in
reverses of fortune, I esteem in my heart as true friends. Who is not
the friend of the prosperous man, in his times of abundance?</li>
<li>&ldquo;So those who, having obtained riches in the world, employ them
for the sake of their friends and religions,&ndash;their wealth has real
solidity, and when it perishes it produces no pain at the end.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This thy suggestion concerning me, O King, is prompted by pure
generosity and friendship; I will meet thee courteously with simple
friendship, I would not utter aught else in my reply.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am not so afraid even of serpents nor of thunderbolts
falling from heaven, nor of flames blown together by the wind, as I am
afraid of these worldly objects.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These transient pleasures,&ndash;the robbers of our happiness and
our wealth, and which float empty and like illusions through the
world,&ndash;infatuate man&rsquo;s minds even when they are only hoped
for,&ndash;still more when they take up their abode in the soul.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The victims of pleasure attain not to happiness even in the
heaven of the gods, still less in the world of mortals; he who is
athirst is never satisfied with pleasures, as the fire, the friend of
the wind, with fuel.</li>
<li>&ldquo;There is no calamity in the world like pleasures, people are
devoted to them through delusion; when he once knows the truth and so
fears evil, what wise man would of his own choice desire evil?</li>
<li>&ldquo;When they have obtained all the earth girdled by the sea,
kings wish to conquer the other side of the great ocean; mankind is
never satiated with pleasures, as the ocean with the waters that fall
into it.<br>
13, &ldquo;When it had rained a golden shower from heaven, and when he
had conquered the continents and had even obtained the half of Sakra&rsquo;s
throne, Mandhatri was still full of craving for worldly objects.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Though he enjoyed the kingdom of the gods in heaven, when
Indra had concealed himself through fear of Vritra, and though in his
pride he had made the great Rishis bear his litter, Nahusha was not
satisfied.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Who would seek these enemies bearing the name of pleasures,
by whom even those sages have been overcome, who were devoted to other
pursuits, whose only clothes were rags, whose food roots, fruits, and
water, and who wear their twisted locks as long as snakes</li>
<li>&ldquo;When they hear of the miseries of those who are intent on
pleasure and are devoted to worldly pursuits, it well befits the
self-controlled to fling it away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Success in pleasure is to be considered a misery in the man
of pleasure, for he becomes intoxicated when the pleasures of his
desire are attained; through intoxication he does what should not be
done, not what should be done ; and being wounded thereby he falls
into a miserable end.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These pleasures which are gained and kept by toil, which
after deceiving leave you and return whence they came,&ndash;these
pleasures which are but borrowed for a time,&ndash;what man of
self-control, if he is wise, would delight in them?</li>
<li>&ldquo;What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
pleasures which are like a torch of hay,&ndash;which excite thirst when you
seek them and when you grasp them?</li>
<li>&ldquo;What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
pleasures which are like flesh that has been flung away, and which
produces [=produce] misery by their being held in common with
kings?</li>
<li>&ldquo;What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
pleasures, which, like the senses, are destructive, which bring
calamity on every hand to those who abide in them?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Those men of self-control who are bitten by them in their
hearts, fall into ruin and attain not bliss&ndash;what man of self-control
could find satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like an angry,
cruel serpent?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even if they enjoy them men are not satisfied,&ndash;like dogs
famishing with hunger over a bone&ndash;what man of self control could find
satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like a skeleton composed of
dry bones?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He whose intellect is blinded with pleasures, the wretch who
is the miserable slave of hope for the sake of pleasures, well
deserves the pain of death even in the world of living.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Deer are lured to their destruction by songs, insects for the
sake of the brightness fly into the fire, the fish greedy for the
flesh swallows the iron hook,&ndash;therefore, worldly pleasures produce
misery as their end.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As for the common opinion, &lsquo;pleasures are enjoyment&rsquo;, none of
them when examined are worthy of being enjoyed; fine garments and the
rest are only the accessories of things,&ndash;they are to be regarded as
merely the remedies for pain.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Water is desired for allaying thirst; food in the same way
for removing hunger; a house for keeping off the wind, the heat of the
sun, and the rain; and dress for keeping off the cold and to cover
one&rsquo;s nakedness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;So too a bed is for removing drowsiness; a carriage for
remedying the fatigue of a journey; a seat for alleviating the pain of
standing; so bathing as [=is] a means for washing, health, and
strength.</li>
<li>&ldquo;External objects therefore are to human beings means for
remedying pain&ndash;not in themselves sources of enjoyment; what wise man
would allow that he enjoys those delights which are only used as
remedial?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who, when burned with the heat of bilious fever, maintains
that cold appliances are an enjoyment, when he is only engaged in
alleviating pain,&ndash;he indeed might give the name of enjoyment to
pleasures.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since variableness is found in all pleasures, I cannot apply
to them the name of enjoyment; the very conditions which mark
pleasure, bring also in their turn pain.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Heavy garments and fragrant aloe-wood are pleasant in the
cold, but an annoyance in the heat; and the moonbeams and sandalwood
are pleasant in the heat, but a pain in the cold.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since the well-known opposite pairs, such as gain and loss
and the rest, are inseparably connected with everything in this
world,&ndash;therefore, no man is invariably happy on the earth, nor
invariably wretched.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When I see how the nature of pleasure and pain are mixed, I
consider royalty and slavery as the same; a king does not always
smile, nor is a slave always in pain.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Since to be a king involves a wider range of responsibility,
therefore the sorrows of a king are great; for a king is like a
peg,&ndash;he endures trouble for the sake of the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;A king is unfortunate, if he places his trust in his royalty
which is apt to desert, and loves crooked turns; and, on the other
hand, if he does not trust in it, then what can be the happiness of a
timid king?</li>
<li>&ldquo;And since after even conquering the whole earth, one city
only can serve as a dwelling place, and even there only one house can
be inhabited, is not royalty mere labour for others?</li>
<li>&ldquo;And even in royalty nothing more than one pair of garments is
all he needs, and just enough food to keep off hunger; so only one
bed, and only one seat is all that a king needs; other distinctions
are only for pride.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And if all these fruits are desired for the sake of
satisfaction, I can be satisfied without a kingdom; and if a man is
once satisfied in this world, are not all distinctions unnecessary?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He then who has attained the auspicious road to happiness is
not to be deceived in regard to pleasures. Remembering thy professed
friendship, I ask, tell me again and again, are the pleasures worth
anything?</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have not left home through anger, nor because my diadem has
been dashed down by an enemy&rsquo;s arrow; nor have I set my desires on
loftier objects, that I thus refuse thy proposal.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Only he who, having once let go a malignant, incensed
serpent, or a blazing hay-torch all on fire, would strive again to
seize it, would ever seek pleasures again after having once abandoned
them.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Only he who, though seeing, would envy the blind; though
free, the bound; though wealthy, the destitute; though sound in his
reason, the maniac&ndash;only he, I say, would envy one who is devoted to
wordly objects.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He who lives on alms, my good friend, is not to be pitied. He
has here the best happiness, perfect calm, and hereafter all sorrows
are for him abolished.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But he is to be pitied who is overpowered by craving though
in the midst of great wealth,&ndash;who attains not the happiness of calm
here, while pain has to be experienced hereafter.</li>
<li>&ldquo;What thou has spoken to me is well worthy of thy character,
thy mode of life, and thy family; and to carry out my resolve is also
befitting my character, my mode of life, and my family.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Reply by Gautama (concluded)</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;I have been wounded by the strife of the world, and I have
come out longing to obtain peace; I would not accept any empire in the
third heaven, for saving me from all the ills of the earth; how much
less amongst men?</li>
<li>&ldquo;But as for what thou has said to me, O King, that the
universal pursuit of the three objects is the supreme end of man,&ndash;and
thou saidst that what I regard as the desirable is misery,&ndash;thy three
objects are perishable and also unsatisfying.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And as for what thou saidst, &lsquo;wait till old age comes, for
youth is ever subject to change&rsquo;;&ndash;this want of decision is itself
uncertain; for age too can be irresolute and youth can be firm.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But since Fate is so well skilled in its art as to draw the
world in all its various ages into its power,&ndash;how shall the wise man,
who desires tranquillity, wait for old age, when he knows not when the
time of death will be?</li>
<li>&ldquo;When death stands ready like a hunter, with old age as his
weapon, and diseases scattered about as his arrows, smiting down
living creatures who fly like deer to the forest of destiny, what
desire can there be in anyone for length of life?</li>
<li>&ldquo;It well befits the youthful son or the old man or the child so
to act with all promptitude, that they may choose the path of the
religious man whose soul is all mercy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And as for what thou saidst, be diligent in sacrifices for
religion, such as are worthy of thy race and bring a glorious
fruit',&ndash;honour to such sacrifices! I desire not that fruit which is
sought by causing pain to others!</li>
<li>&ldquo;To kill a helpless victim through a wish for future
reward,&ndash;it would be unseemly action for a merciful, good-hearted man,
even if the reward of the sacrifice were eternal.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And even if true religion did not consist in quite another
rule of conduct, by self-restraint, moral practice and a total absence
of passion,&ndash;still it would not be seemly to follow the rule of
sacrifice, where the highest reward is described as attained only by
slaughter.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even that happiness which comes to a man while he stays in
this world, through the injury of another, is hateful to the wise
compassionate heart; how much more if it be something beyond our sight
in another life?</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am not to be lured into a course of action for future
reward,&ndash;my mind does not delight, O King, in future births; these
actions are uncertain and wavering in their direction, like plants
beaten by the rain from a cloud.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The king himself, folding his hands, replied, &ldquo;Thou art
obtaining thy desire without hindrance; when thou has at last
accomplished all that thou has to do, thou shall show hereafter thy
favour towards me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having received a firm promise from Gautama to visit him
again, the monarch, taking his courtiers with him, returned to the
palace.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. News of Peace</p>
<ol>
<li>While Gautama was staying in Rajagraha there came five other
Parivrajakas, who also put up a hut by the side of the hut which
Gautama had erected for himself.</li>
<li>These five Parivrajakas were Kaundinya, Ashvajit, Kasyapa,
Mahanam, and Bhaduka.</li>
<li>They too were struck by Gautama&rsquo;s appearance, and wondered what
could have led him to take Parivraja.</li>
<li>They questioned him over the issue in the same way as did King
Bimbisara.</li>
<li>When he explained to them the circumstances which led him to
take Parivraja, they said, &ldquo;We have heard of it. But do you know what
has happened since you left?&rdquo; they asked.</li>
<li>Siddharth said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then they told him that after he left
Kapilavatsu, there was a great agitation among the Sakyas against
going to war with the Koliyas.</li>
<li>There were demonstrations and processions by men and women,
boys and girls, carrying flags with such slogans as, &ldquo;Koliyas are our
brothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is wrong for a brother to fight against brother.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Think of the exile of Siddharth Gautama,&rdquo; etc.</li>
<li>The result of the agitation was that the Sakya Sangh had to
call a meeting and reconsider the question. This time the majority was
for compromise with the Koliyas.</li>
<li>The Sangh decided to select five Sakyas to act as their envoys
and negotiate peace with the Koliyas.</li>
<li>When the Koliyas heard of this they were very glad. They too
selected five Koliyas to deal with the envoys of the Sakyas.</li>
<li>The envoys on the two sides met and agreed to appoint a
permanent Council of Arbitration, with authority to settle every
dispute regarding the sharing of the waters of the river Rohini, and
both sides to abide by its decision. Thus the threatened war had ended
in peace.</li>
<li>After informing Gautama of what had happened at Kapilavatsu,
the Parivrajakas said, &ldquo;There is now no need for you to continue to be
a Parivrajaka. Why don&rsquo;t you go home and join your family?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Siddharth said, &ldquo;I am happy to have this good news. It is a
triumph for me. But I will not go back to my home. I must not. I must
continue to be a Parivrajaka.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Gautama asked the five Parivrajakas what their programme was.
They replied, &ldquo;We have decided to do <em>tapasya</em>. Why don&rsquo;t you join
us?&rdquo; Siddharth said, &ldquo;By and b ; I must examine other ways first.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The five Parivrajakas then left.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. The Problem in a New Perspective</p>
<ol>
<li>The news brought by the five Parivrajakas that the Koliyas and
Sakyas had made peace, made Gautama very uneasy.</li>
<li>Left alone, he began to reflect on his own position, and to
make sure if any reason was left for him to continue his Parivraja.</li>
<li>He had left his people for what?, he asked himself.</li>
<li>He had left his home because he was opposed to war. &ldquo;Now that
the war is over, is there any problem left to me? Does my problem end
because war has ended?&rdquo;</li>
<li>On a deep reflection, he thought not.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The problem of war is essentially a problem of conflict. It is
only a part of a larger problem.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This conflict is going on not only between kings and nations,
but between nobles and Brahmins, between householders, between mother
and son, between son and mother, between father and son, between
sister and brother, between companion and companion.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The conflict between nations is occasional. But the conflict
between classes is constant and perpetual. It is this which is the
root of all sorrow and suffering in the world.</li>
<li>&ldquo;True, I left home on account of war. But I cannot go back
home, although the war between the Sakyas and Koliyas has ended. I see
now that my problem has become wider. I have to find a solution for
this problem of social conflict.</li>
<li>&ldquo;How far do the old-established philosophies offer a solution
of this problem?”</li>
<li>Can [=Could] he accept any one of the social philosophies?</li>
<li>He was determined to examine everything for himself.</li>

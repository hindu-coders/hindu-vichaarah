      <description>FROM THE COVER OF &amp;ldquo;NEGATIONISM IN INDIA - CONCEALING THE RECORD OF ISLAM&amp;rdquo; Negationism usually means the denial of the Nazi genocide of the Jews and Gypsies in World War 2. Less well-known is that India has its own brand of negationism. A section of the Indian intelligentsia is still trying to erase from the Hindus&#39; memory the history of their persecution by the swordsmen of Islam. The number of victims of this persecution surpasses that of the Nazi crimes.</description>

      <title>02 Some Excerpts</title>

      <description>Some Excerpts The next generation of political leaders, especially the left-wing that was to gain control of Congress in the thirties, and complete control in the fifties, would profess negationism very explicitly. The radical humanist (i.e. bourgeois Marxist) M.N. Roy wrote that Islam had fulfilled a historic mission of equality and abolition of discrimination, and that for this, Islam had been welcomed into India by the lower castes. If at all any violence had occurred, it was as a matter of justified class struggle by the progressive forces against the reactionary forces, meaning the fedual Hindu upper castes.</description>

      <title>03 CHAPTER ONE - NEGATIONISM IN GENERAL</title>

      <description>CHAPTER ONE - NEGATIONISM IN GENERAL Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity. It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but the denial of known facts. The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941-45, also known as the holocaust (Greek: fire sacrifice) or the Shoah (Hebrew: disaster). Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history in such a way that the fact of the Holocaust is omitted.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWO - NEGATIONISM IN INDIA The negationism regarding the Nazi crimes has been the object of much public discussion. Turkish negationism about the Armenian genocide has received some attention. Less well-known is that India has its own brand of negationism.
Since about 1920 an effort has been going on in India to rewrite history and to deny the millennium-long attack of Islam on Hinduism. Today, most politicians and English- writing intellectuals in India will go out of their way to condemn any public reference to this long and painful conflict in the strongest terms.</description>

      <title>05 CHAPTER THREE - EXPOSING AND REFUTING NEGATIONISM</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/books/elst/negationism_in_india/05_ch3/</link>

      <description>CHAPTER THREE - EXPOSING AND REFUTING NEGATIONISM Negationism and history-distortion require a large-scale effort and a very strong grip on the media of information and education. As soon as the grip loosens, at least the most blatant of the negationist concoctions are bound to be exposed, and its propounders lose all credibility. In 1988, the schools in the Soviet Union decided to suspend the history exams because &amp;ldquo;the history books are full of lies anyway&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FOUR - REPLY TO SOME QUESTIONS AND CRITICISMS After the publication of first edition of this book, and of articles containing some of its ideas, I have received some comments to which I will reply here.
 4.1 BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY &amp;ldquo;You have been too much influenced by these Hindus among whom you lived in Benares and Delhi. You haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the other side of the story.&amp;quot;</description>

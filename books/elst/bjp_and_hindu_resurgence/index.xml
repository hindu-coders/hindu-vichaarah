      <description>Introduction  Many people inside or close to the BJP, and inside or close to  the broader Sangh Parivar, have become dissatisfied with what they perceive as the increasing distance between the BJP&amp;rsquo;s actual policies and the Hindu expectations among the public on which the party capitalizes. To some extent, the problem lies with the BJP itself, distinguishing it from other Hindutva organizations, who then tend to blame the increasing non-Sangh element inside the BJP for this &amp;ldquo;degeneration&amp;rdquo;, especially the opportunists who jumped onto the promising BJP bandwagon after the 1989 and 1991 electoral breakthroughs.</description>

      <description>1. Anything but a &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; party
The strange thing about the BJP is that its voters consider it a Hindu party, its enemies denounce it as a Hindu party, but the party will call itself anything except a Hindu party.
 Unlike most critics of the BJP, who tend to make their point by  quoting sources openly hostile to the party, we should prove our case by going to its own formulations of its ideology.</description>

      <description>2. &amp;ldquo;Equal respect for all religions&amp;rdquo;
 The only explicitly Indian contribution in the cited BJS/BJP  self-declarations is of doubtful value: &amp;ldquo;positive secularism&amp;rdquo; defined as &amp;ldquo;sarva-dharma-samabhava&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;equal respect for all religions&amp;rdquo;. We let the difference with the original European concept of secularism (equal indifference towards all religions, equal independence from all religions) pass, and focus on the problematic meaning of the slogan defining this &amp;ldquo;positive secularism&amp;rdquo;. Two meanings are attested: the political meaning apparently given to it in the cited BJP texts, viz.</description>

      <description>3. What is Wrong with &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;?
 To an extent, the avoidance of the term &amp;quot;Hindu&amp;quot; has  characterized many earlier avatars of Hindu nationalism. Sri Aurobindo titled his newspaper &amp;ldquo;Arya&amp;rdquo;, and declared that India would rise with &amp;ldquo;Sanatana Dharma&amp;rdquo;, a more profound term than the colloquial &amp;ldquo;Hinduism&amp;rdquo;. The Arya Samaj preferred the term &amp;ldquo;Vedic&amp;rdquo;, or the Vedic term &amp;ldquo;Arya&amp;rdquo; (denoting adherence to Vedic civilizational standards), to the originally purely geographical Persian term &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>4. The BJP flag
 A &amp;quot;Hindu&amp;quot; or non-Hindu party name would matter little if the  policies behind it would be the right ones, but as we shall demonstrate, the avoidance of a Hindu self‑designation goes hand in hand with the avoidance of certain pressing Hindu concerns in the party&amp;rsquo;s policies. While we are discussing the party&amp;rsquo;s self‑presentation, we may add to our doubts about the chosen name, the question of the party&amp;rsquo;s flag.</description>

      <description>5. How the Rama card was thrown away
 Ever since the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December  1996, the BJP has as silent as possible on the Ayodhya issue. It is just too embarrassed, and avoids mentioning the very name of Ayodhya or Rama. On 17 December 1992 already, A.B. Vajpayee declared in the Lok Sabha: &amp;ldquo;We are very sad at what happened in Ayodhya on the 6th December.</description>

      <description>6. Sangh Parivar, the last Gandhians
 When in 1980, the secularist tendency led by Nana Deshmukh and  Atal Behari Vajpayee imposed &amp;ldquo;Gandhian socialism&amp;rdquo; on the newly founded BJP as its official ideology, all the establishment secularists laughed at this transparent attempt to acquire a new secular identity.[1] &amp;ldquo;This party is neither Gandhian nor socialist&amp;rdquo;, they said. The party was in fact more socialist than it would like to admit after liberalization became the new orthodoxy, certainly more socialist than the non-socialist &amp;ldquo;cleverest bourgeois scoundrel&amp;rdquo; Gandhi ever was, but we can agree that it was less socialist than was normative in 1980.</description>

      <description>7. Gandhian non-violence
 One point where the BJP seems to be decidedly un-Gandhian is  defence policy. Whereas Gandhi had advocated a strictly non-violent strategy including an unarmed defence against the impending Japanese invasion, the BJP advocates a strong defence capability including weapons of mass destruction. Yet, even here the BJP is more Gandhian than one would expect.
 The famous quotation of Mahatma Gandhi on Hindu cowards and  Muslim bullies deserves to be read in full: &amp;ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind that in the majority of quarrels the Hindus come out second best.</description>

      <description>8. The Sangh&amp;rsquo;s anti-intellectualism
 A very serious flaw which Gandhians and the Sangh have in  common is their anti-intellectualism. Though Gandhi reputedly rebuked RSS founder K.B. Hedgewar for not publishing any doctrinal statements, i.e. for not giving any intellectual articulation to his nationalist movement, he essentially shared Hedgewar&amp;rsquo;s aversion for an intellectual job well done. Both of them made people march many miles, both led their followers to make great sacrifices, and both failed to substantially raise their followers&#39; political understanding.</description>

      <description>9. The Sangh as dinosaur
 The anti-intellectualism of the Sangh Parivar is a sufficiently  serious problem to warrant a closer discussion. The situation on the ground is that RSS men seldom sit down to do any thinking, but are always on the move. As a US-based Hindutva activist told me: &amp;ldquo;When I make a phone call to an RSS office-bearer in India, he will most often not be in the Delhi office, not in Nagpur or another town, but somewhere on the way.</description>

      <description>10. Anti-intellectualism in action
 The two most important consequences of the anti-intellectual  prejudice animating the Sangh are, firstly, an extreme ineptness at public relations, and secondly, the stunted development of the Sangh Parivar&amp;rsquo;s own intellectual grip on the world. An example of the first is the staggering failure of the Hindu campaign reclaiming Ayodhya to communicate its case to the world, as already discussed. The worst part of it is not that the Sangh people failed to communicate the Hindu case (the biased press was indeed a formidable obstacle), but that it never took the trouble of verifying whether its message came across nor of devising ways to deal with the hostile climate in the media and among India-watchers.</description>

      <description>11. &amp;ldquo;I am a Hindu communalist&amp;rdquo;
 A symptom of the ideological power equation is the Sangh  Parivar&amp;rsquo;s permanent checkmate in the &amp;ldquo;war of the words&amp;rdquo;. The Sangh is at the mercy of the meanings which its enemies allot to important terms, such as &amp;ldquo;communalism&amp;rdquo;.
 Originally (at least in Indian politics), &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; was the  term by which the British labelled political arrangements, such as separate electorates and quota-based recruitment, which took the religious community as the operative unit rather than the individual or the family or the region or the nation.</description>

      <description>12. Vulgar nationalism
 A consequence of this lack of self-developed understanding of  the forces in the field is that the Sangh is not able to discern objective allies and enemies on the world stage, so that it is unable to make friends. E.g., after liberalization and globalization became hot items, the Sangh Parivar including the BJP has been multiplying and intensifying its attacks on the USA. Time and again, Hindutva spokesmen have been presenting the impersonal process of globalization as an American ploy to take over the world (just as Westerners once depicted earlier developments in capitalism as Jewish conspiracies to dispossess the workers and smallholders).</description>

      <description>13. Hindutva and other peoples&#39; nationalism
 The BJP&#39;s subordination of any and every ideological or  religious conflict to questions of &amp;ldquo;national unity and integrity&amp;rdquo;, this most mindless form of territorial nationalism, is also a worrying retreat from the historical Hindu conception of Indian nationhood and its implications for the evaluation of foreign problems of national unity. Along with Mahatma Gandhi and other Freedom Fighters, the BJS used to be convinced that India was a self-conscious civilizational unit since several thousands of years, strengthened in its realization of unity by the Sanskrit language, the Brahmin caste, the pilgrimage cycles which brought pilgrims from every part of India all around the country (&amp;ldquo;country&amp;rdquo; rather than the &amp;ldquo;Subcontinent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;South Asia&amp;rdquo;, terms which intrinsically question this unity), and other socio-cultural factors of national integration.</description>

      <description>14. The Sangh&amp;rsquo;s Muslims
 In criticizing the Sangh&#39;s simplistic anti-Americanism, I am  not holding a brief for American foreign policy. The Organiser is entirely right in arguing that American officials are being extremely silly when they base their policies on the assumption that Pakistan is a bulwark against (rather than of) Islamic fundamentalism. But this mistake is hardly typically American: in Organiser itself, columnists play the same game of labelling Muslim entities, without asking their consent, as bulwarks against Islamic fanaticism.</description>

      <description>15. A party of shopkeepers
 The BJP eagerly wants to be friends with everyone who counts as  respectable. The best predictor of their positions in upcoming political issues is: what will the opinion-making establishment say? When new fads appear on the public scene, whether it is the Ambedkar cult or reservations for women in Parliament, the BJP is sure to pick them up in due course.[1] Instead of radicalism, the record of its manifestoes, resolutions, interventions in parliament, and public statements, shows a goody-goody approach to all the forces which are animated by a declared and unyielding hatred of the BJP.</description>

      <description>16. Things to do for the BJP
 The cleverness of the BJP is in evidence again in its choice to  put the enactment of a Common Civil Code on India&amp;rsquo;s political agenda. In India, marriage, divorce and inheritance are regulated by religion-based law codes which are different for Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis. Thus, a Hindu who wants to marry two women, knows that he will be punishable, but no longer if he converts to Islam (which is why there are actual cases of conversion for the sake of bigamy).</description>

      <description>17. Christ in India
 The Sangh is even less combative vis-à-vis Christianity than  vis-à-vis Islam. The Christian Churches must be counted among Hindutva&amp;rsquo;s most determined enemies. Much of the negative image which the BJP has acquired internationally is due to the lasting powerful impact of the Churches on the information stream concerning the Third World. In quarrels between the Hindutva forces and the Muslims or the secularists, the Christian institutions are invariably on the anti-Hindu side.</description>

      <description>18. Hindus wielding the sword of Islam
 When Akbar had Rajput armies fight his Rajput enemies, he  rejoiced at the sight of &amp;ldquo;Hindus wielding the sword of Islam&amp;rdquo;. When his archers could not distinguish between the Rajput mercenaries and the Rajput freedom-fighters, he told them that it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, since anyone killed would be a Kafir anyway. India&amp;rsquo;s greatest Moghul is often mindlessly lauded by Hindus as a &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; ruler, but while he should be credited with a certain wisdom, he was and remained an enemy of the Infidels.</description>

      <description>19. How not to deal with Islam
 When dealing with Islam, it is crucially important to keep in  mind the distinction between Islam as a doctrine and the Muslims, a group of people who were born or tricked into an Islamic environment. There is nothing intrinsically Islamic about human beings, not even when they are named Mohammed or Aisha.
 In Europe, the secularist Left accuses the mushrooming  national‑populist and xenophobic parties of a &amp;ldquo;biologization of cultural differences&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>20. How to deal with Islam
 The &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; problem is simple, and so is its solution. The  root cause of communal riots, of the Partition with its nearly a million victims, and of the East Bengal genocide with its three million victims, is the Islamic doctrine of permanent hostility against the unbelievers.[1] As the Quran says: &amp;ldquo;Fight them until idolatry is no more and religion belongs to Allah alone&amp;rdquo; (2:193 and 8:39), and: &amp;ldquo;Enmity and hate shall reign between us until ye believe in Allah alone&amp;rdquo; (60:4).</description>

      <description>21. Know the truth, and the truth shall make you free
 The struggle against Islamic aggression cannot be won without  taking issue with the basic doctrines of Islam, i.e. explaining to the Muslims that they have no reason to stay with the refuted dogmas of Islam. The same is true for Christianity. The Sangh Parivar has made much ado about the Christian demand for reservations for &amp;ldquo;Christian Dalits&amp;rdquo;, and about continuing Christian proselytization in tribal areas.</description>

      <description>22. Hindu objections
 A Hindu policy of ideological confrontation with hostile  religions is necessary for the survival of India as an essentially Hindu country. After having flattered Christianity and Islam for several centuries, Hindus inside and outside the Sangh may come up with many objections against such a policy. As a BJP man once told me: &amp;ldquo;When we attack Christianity, it is not the Christians who leave us &amp;ndash; they are not with us anyway &amp;ndash;, it is the Hindus who won&amp;rsquo;t vote for us.</description>

      <description>23. Conclusion
 In spite of Hinduism&#39;s nominal magnitude, the chance that  Hinduism gets wiped out by its enemies can no longer be discounted. More than ever, fortunes are spent on the war to destroy Hinduism in favour of Islam or some suitably adapted variety of Christianity or Marxism. The hostile activities of Islamic and Christian agitators and the attempts at Hindu demoralization and loss of Hindu self-respect by the secularists are now compounded by a fast-spreading loss of Hindu memory at the mass level by consumerism and Western pulp media.</description>

      <description>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION
The first two editions of this book were published in quick succession - July 1986 and July 1987 - because it was received with great interest and appreciation by the Hindu intelligentsia at large, in this country and abroad. But the present (third) edition has been delayed inordinately in spite of persistent demand after the second edition went out of print in 1988. A reprint of the second edition was not brought out because I wanted to include in a new edition the copious materials which I had collected in the meanwhile from orthodox collections of Hadis and which I thought worth presenting to the readers.</description>

      <description>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
Soon after the first edition of this book was published in July 1986, a significant judgment on some Ayats of the Quran was pronounced by Z.S. Lohat, metropolitan magistrate of Delhi. As most of these Ayats and others of a similar sort figure in the Calcutta Quran Petition of Chandmal Chopra, we thought it relevant to reproduce the impugned poster in which the Ayats were cited. Operative portion of the judgment is also being reproduced in order to give a glimpse of the arguments for and against.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 1
A GOVERNMENT IN PANIC
Muslims in India have often sought shelter under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C.) for preventing every public discussion of their creed in general and of their prophet in particular.^(1) Quite a few publications which examine critically the sayings and doings of the Prophet or other idolized personalities of Islam, have been proscribed under Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 2
THE JUDGMENT MISSES THE MAIN POINT
It is not for laymen like us to discuss the correctness or otherwise of a High Court judgment. It should better be left to those who are conversant with the law and can enter into the intricacies of interpretation and logical construction. For all we know, it is perhaps impossible to impugn a book under the existing law, if it is assumed at the very outset that the book is a sacred scripture cherished as such by a certain community.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 3
ENTIRE QURAN IS A MANUAL ON JIHAD
Now we can take up the third observation in Justice Basak’s judgement, namely, that “This book [The Quran] is not prejudicial to maintenance of religious harmony”, and that “Because of the Koran no public tranquility has been disturbed upto now and there is no reason to apprehend any likelihood of such disturbance in future”. He has gone further and chosen to repeat the etymological exercise which we find in most of the books written by apologists of Islam in modem times.</description>

THE PROPHET SETS THE PATTERN
Prophecy about the Prophet
[A Jew from Syria had migrated to Medina some years before Muhammad proclaimed his prophethood in 610 CE.]
Later when he knew that he was about to die he said, “O Jews, what do you think made me leave a land of bread and wine to come to a land of hardship and hunger?” When we [the Jews] said that we could not think why, he said that he had come to this country expecting to see the emergence of a prophet whose time was at hand.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 5
THE ORTHODOX EXPOSITION OF JIHAD
Imam Abu Hanifa, the eighth-century systematizer of Muslim law, is held in the highest regard by Muslims all over the world. He is also the most important authority for Muslims in India, a majority of whom subscribe to his school (mazhab). And the most outstanding treatise of his school is the HidAyah compiled by Shaykh Burhan-ud-din Ali who flourished in the 12th century (CE).</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 6
JIHAD IN INDIA’S HISTORY
The principles of jihAd elaborated in countless compendia composed by Islamic scholars, have been generalized from concrete practices of the Prophet, and confirmed by Allah through “revelations” in the Quran. In turn, these principles have guided all swordsmen of Islam throughout these fourteen countries and in many lands.
India has had a prolonged experience of jihAd from the day when the first Muslim army stepped into Sindh in 712 CE and won its first victories after suffering a number of defeats for 78 years.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 7
DOCTRINE OF THE ISLAMIC STATE
The doctrine of jihAd, which is the whole of the Quran, deals primarily with the performance of the militarized Muslim Ummah till the time an “infidel land” is conquered and Muslim hold is consolidated over it by terrorising its people through slaughter and pillage. The operations of the same military machine after the conquest are dealt with by another department of Islamic theology - doctrine of the Islamic state.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 8
MUSLIM UMMAH IS A MILITARY MACHINE
The teeming tomes on orthodox Islamic theology devote plenty of space to non-warlike subjects, such as faith, purification, prayers, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, marriage, divorce, business transactions, inheritance, gifts, bequests, vows, oaths, crime, punishment, government, hunting, food, drink, dress, decoration, greetings, magic, poetry, visions, dreams, virtue, last day, repentance, etc. But the rules laid down for every Muslim, everywhere and at all times, are the same.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 9
THE PETITION HAS SERVED A GREAT PURPOSE
By filing the Writ Petition for a ban on the Quran, Chandmal Chopra has invited attention to a subject which Hindus have neglected for long and at great cost to themselves. They have yet to examine critically the claim of the Quran as a sacred scripture and of Islam as a religion. If Hindus now take up this study in all seriousness and educate themselves about the character of Islam, the Petition will have served its purpose.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 10
A CLOSE LOOK AT ALLAH OF THE QURAN
The one name which Muslims hate and fear most is that of Chengiz Khan. He is a spectre which has haunted Muslim historians for centuries. He swept like a tornado over the then most powerful and extensive Islamic empire of Khwarazm. In a short span of five years (1219-1224 CE), he slaughtered millions of Muslims, forced many others including women and children into slavery, and razed to the ground quite a few of the most populous and prosperous cities of the Muslim world at that time.</description>

HIMANGSHU KISHORE’S LETTER

Himangshu Kishore Chakraborty, M.A., (Cal.),

 To,

Writers’ Building,
Calcutta - 1.
Dear Sir,
Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.
As you may be aware, the Islamic religious book, Koran, also spelt as ‘Qur’an’, said to be a collection of revelations made through the angel Gabriel by the almighty Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, containing numerous sayings, repeated in the book over and over again, which on grounds of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility, and though most of the events which had occasioned those sayings have now lost all historical significance, the book is still published in the unabridged form, with persistence, and clearly with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging or insulting other religions and the religious feelings of other communities in India which is apparent from the fact that all the publishers of the book know very well that the various sayings of the book are offensive in this sense.</description>

Dear Sir,
Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.
Please refer to my letter dated 20th July, 1984, (delivered in your office on the same date) in which I had made a request for forfeiture of the Islamic book, Koran, for the reason that it contains numerous sayings of Prophet Muhammad which on ground of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities; incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility and outrage or insult other religions and the religious feelings of other communities in India, which render the book liable to be forfeited to the Government in terms of Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, read with Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code.</description>

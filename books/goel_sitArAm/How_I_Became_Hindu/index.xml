      <description>FROM ARYA SAMAJ TO MAHATMA GANDHI (I promised this intellectual autobiography to Hashmat, some twenty years ago. Hashmat wrote frequently in the Organiser under the general heading &amp;ldquo;Pakistan X-Rayed&amp;rdquo;. It is years since I lost track of him. But I never forgot my promise. I wonder what I would have written twenty years ago. I wonder also how this story will shape if I wait for another twenty years. And I do not know what its worth is today.</description>

      <title>01 FROM GANDHISM TO COMMUNISM</title>

      <description>FROM GANDHISM TO COMMUNISM I had a brief encounter with the Sthanakavasi Svetambara sect of Jainism also, at about the same time. The school in which I was a student was a Svetambara Jam school. The relative with whom I stayed was also a Jain. There was a daily period in our school for teaching the elements of Jain dharma. But the Jam community which I saw from close quarters was too decadent, self centred, and morose for my taste.</description>

      <description>SEEDS THAT WERE TO SPROUT Four years after leaving college I was ready to join the Communist Party of India when it declared war on the newly born Republic of India in February 1948. I conveyed my decision to my friend Ram Swarup, whom I had met after leaving college and who was to exercise a decisive influence on my intellectual evolution. He wrote back immediately: &amp;ldquo;You are too intelligent not to become a Communist.</description>

      <title>03 SOME INTERESTING ENCOUNTERS</title>

      <description>SOME INTERESTING ENCOUNTERS My plight was pretty serious after I left college. I was now a married man and the father of a son. There was a family to support which included my parents in die village. But I had not a penny in my pocket. I gave up the only job I could get as a clerk in the Central Secretariat after exactly 65 days because I was ashamed to be a cog in the British imperialist machine.</description>

      <title>04 CLOSE TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY</title>

      <description>CLOSE TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY I saw quite a bit of the Great Calcutta Killing of August 16-17, 1946 with my own eyes. There were a large number of dead bodies lying on the streets. There were many more floating down the Hooghly. I saw an extensive destruction of private and public property by fire as well as by mob fury. The death and desolation all around moved me to despair about human nature itself.</description>

      <title>05 RAM SWARUP TO THE RESCUE</title>

      <description>RAM SWARUP TO THE RESCUE I was present in the Second Party Conference of the Communist Party of India which was held in the Maidan at Calcutta in February, 1948. It was some time before this Conference that B. T. Ranadive had taken over from P.C. Joshi the General Secretaryship of the CPI. The Ranadive line, as it came to be known in India, was an adoption of the international Communist line laid down by Stalin through the mouth of his minion, Zhdanov, in September 1947.</description>

      <title>06 BACK TO SQUARE ONE</title>

      <description>BACK TO SQUARE ONE I was back to square one. My faith in Gandhism had lost the battle to Marxism. Now I was no longer a Marxist. I asked myself again and again: Where do I go from here?
The business of life can go on very well without an ideological frame of reference. One eats and mates and sleeps and makes a living. One reads books and papers and gossips and goes about passing conventional judgments on current events, One has a family, a profession, a circle of friends, and some hobby to keep one occupied in leisure time.</description>

      <title>07 RETURN TO MY SPIRTUAL HOME</title>

      <description>RETURN TO MY SPIRTUAL HOME I had to leave Calcutta for good and return to Delhi on account of my health. I had spent twelve long years in that great and stormy centre of Bengali culture and politics. I had participated in Calcutta&amp;rsquo;s politics in a way. It was my misfortune that I did not drink equally deep at the fount of Bengali culture which had, in the recent past, become synonymous with India&amp;rsquo;s reawakening to her innermost soul.</description>

      <title>08 NIGHTMARE OF NEHRUISM</title>

      <description>NIGHTMARE OF NEHRUISM I am adding this postscript to the third reprint of what may be described as my intellectual autobiography in order to complete my story as a convinced and conscious Hindu. The story relates mainly to my encounter with Nehruism in its various expressions.
Today, I view Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru as a bloated Brown Sahib, and Nehruism as the combined embodiment of all the imperialist ideologies Islam, Christianity, White Man&amp;rsquo;s Burden, and Communism that have flooded this country in the wake of foreign invasions.</description>

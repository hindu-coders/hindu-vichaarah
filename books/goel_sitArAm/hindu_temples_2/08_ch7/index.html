  <p><strong>CHAPTER SEVEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE LITERARY EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>Islamic literary sources provide far more extensive evidence of temple
destruction by the Muslim invaders of India in medieval times. They also
cover a larger area, from Sinkiang and Transoxiana in the North to Tamil
Nadu in the South, and from the Seistan province of present-day Iran in
the West to Assam in the East. As we wade through this evidence, we can
visualise how this vast area, which was for long the cradle of Hindu
culture, came to be literally littered with the ruins of temples and
monasteries belonging to all schools of Sanãtana Dharma-Bauddha, Jaina,
Šaiva, Šãkta, VaishNava and the rest. Archaeological explorations and
excavations in modern times have proved unmistakably that most of the
mosques, <em>mazãrs, ziãrats</em> and <em>dargãhs</em> which were built in this area
in medieval times, stood on the sites of and were made from the
materials of deliberately demolished Hindu monuments.</p>
<p>Hundreds of medieval Muslim historians who flourished in India and
elsewhere in the world of Islam, have written detailed accounts of what
their heroes did in various parts of the extensive Hindu homeland as
they were invaded one after another. We have had access only to a few of
these histories on account of our limitations in terms of language and
resources. Most of the histories pertaining to what are known as
provincial Muslim dynasties, have remained beyond our reach. One thing,
however, becomes quite clear from the evidence we have been able to
compile, namely, that almost all Muslim rulers destroyed or desecrated
Hindu temples whenever and wherever they could. Archaeological evidence
from various Muslim monuments, particularly mosques and <em>dargãhs</em>, not
only confirms the literary evidence but also adds the names of some
Muslim rulers whom Muslim historians have failed to credit with this
pious performance.</p>
<p>We are citing the literary evidence also in a chronological order, that
is, with reference to the time at which a particular work was written
and not with reference to the period with which it deals. Appendix 1
Provides the names and dates of dynasties and kings described in these
histories in the context of India. Most of these histories start with
the creation of Adam and Eve or the rise of the Prophet of Islam, and
come down to the time when the authors lived. Glorification of Islam, as
its armies invaded various countries and laid them waste with slaughter
and rapine, is their common theme. The writers have exhausted their
imagination in describing g the holocaust that was caused everywhere and
in coining names for those whom they look down upon as infidels and
idolaters.^(<a href="#1">1</a>)</p>
<p>The apologists of Islam are likely to point out that quite often the
instances of iconoclasm have been copied by succeeding historians from
the writings of their predecessors and that this repetition should be
kept in mind while assessing the extent of temple destruction. There is
no substance in this argument. Firstly, there are many instances of
temple destruction which are not reported in the histories but which
archaeological evidence proves. Secondly, what is relevant in this
context is that the historians regard some instances as significant
enough to bear repetition. It is obvious that no account of some reigns
was considered complete unless the concerned ruler was credited with the
destruction of Hindu temples. Had it not been an important pious
performance from the point of view of Islam, it is inconceivable that
historians who wrote in times when the dust of war had settled down,
would have cared to mention it. The repetitions are valuable from
another point of view as well. In quite a few cases, succeeding
historians add details which are not found in the preceding accounts. It
is immaterial whether the details were missed by the earlier historians
or are the products of the succeeding historians’ imagination. What
matters is that the historians thought them fit for the glorification of
Islam.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong><br>
<strong>Futûhu’l-Buldãn</strong></p>
<p>The author, Ahmad bin Yahya bin Jãbir, is known as al-Bilãdhurî. He
lived at the court of Khalîfa Al-Mutawakkal (AD 847-861) and died in AD
893. His history is one of the earliest and major Arab chronicles. It
gives an account of Arab conquests in Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Iran,
Armenia, Transoxiana, Africa, Spain and Sindh. The account is brought
down to Khalîfa Mu’tasim’s reign in AD 842. We have had no access to a
translation of the full text in a language we know, and have depended on
extracts.</p>
<p><strong>Ibn Samûrah (AD 653)</strong></p>
<p>His full name was ‘Abd ar-Rahmãn bin Samûrah bin Habîb bin ‘Abd
ash-Shams. He was appointed governor of Seistan after the first Arab
invasion of that province in AD 650 was defeated and dispersed. Ibn
Samûrah reached the capital of Seistan in AD 653.</p>
<p><em>Seistan (Iran)</em></p>
<p>“On reaching Dãwar, he surrounded the enemy in the mountain of Zûr,
where there was a famous Hindu temple.”^(<a href="#2">2</a>)</p>
<p>“…Their idol of Zûr was of gold, and its eyes were two rubies. The
zealous Musalmãns cut off its hands and plucked out its eyes, and then
remarked to the Marzabãn how powerless was his idol to do either good or
evil…”^(<a href="#3">3</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Qutaibah bin Muslim al-Bãhilî (AD 705-715)</strong></p>
<p>He was a general of Al-Hajjãj bin Yûsuf Saqafî, the notorious Governor
of Iraq under Caliph Al-Walîd I (AD 705-715). He was made Governor of
Khurasan in AD 705 and is renowned in the history of Islam as the
conqueror of Central Asia right upto Kashghar.</p>
<p><em>Samarqand (Farghana)</em></p>
<p>“Other authorities say that Kutaibah granted peace for 700,000 dirhams
and entertainment for the Moslems for three days. The terms of surrender
included also the houses of the idols and the fire temples. The idols
were thrown out, plundered of their ornaments and burned, although the
Persians used to say that among them was an idol with which whoever
trifled would perish. But when Kutaibah set fire to it with his own
hand, many of them accepted Islãm.”^(<a href="#4">4</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Muhammad bin Qãsim (AD 712-715)</strong></p>
<p>He was the nephew as well as son-in-law of Al-Hajjãj, who sent him to
Sindh after more than a dozen invasions of that province had been
defeated by the Hindus.</p>
<p><em>Debal (Sindh)</em></p>
<p>“…The town was thus taken by assault, and the carnage endured for three
days. The governor of the town, appointed by Dãhir, fled and the priests
of the temple were massacred. Muhammad marked a place for the Musalmans
to dwell in, built a mosque, and left four thousand Musalmans to
garrison the place…</p>
<p>“…‘Ambissa son of Ishãk Az Zabbî, the governor of Sindh, in the Khilafat
of Mu’tasim billah knocked down the upper part of the minaret of the
temple and converted it into a prison. At the same time he began to
repair the ruined town with the stones of the minaret…”^(<a href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p><em>Multan (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>“…He then crossed the Biyãs, and went towards Multãn… Muhammad destroyed
the water-course; upon which the inhabitants, oppressed with thirst,
surrendered at discretion. He massacred the men capable of bearing arms,
but the children were taken captive, as well as the ministers of the
temple, to the number of six thousand. The Muslamãns found there much
gold in a chamber ten cubits long by eight broad, and there was an
aperture above, through which the gold was poured into the
chamber…”^(<a href="#6">6</a>)</p>

<strong>Tãrîkh-i-Tabarî</strong></p>
<p>The author, Abu Ja‘far Muhammad bin Jarîr at-Tabarî, is considered to be
the foremost historian of Islam. His <em>Tãrîkh</em> is regarded as
<em>Umdatu’l-Kutab</em>, mother of histories. He was born at Amil in Tabaristan
in the year AD 839. He was educated at Baghdad and lived in Basra and
Kufa as well. He travelled to Egypt and Damascus in order to perfect his
knowledge of Traditions. He spent the last days of his life in Baghdad
where he died in AD 922. We have had no access to his work in a
translation we could follow. The citations below are only summaries made

<p><strong>Qutaibah bin Muslim al-Bãhilî (AD 705-715)</strong></p>
<p><em>Beykund (Khurasan)</em></p>
<p>“The ultimate capture of Beykund (in AD 706) rewarded him with an
incalculable booty; even more than had hitherto fallen into the hands of
the Mahommedans by the conquest of the entire province of Khorassaun;
and the unfortunate merchants of the town, having been absent on a
trading excursion while their country was assailed by the enemy, and
finding their habitations desolate on their return contributed further
to enrich the invaders, by the ransom which they paid for the recovery
of their wives and children. The ornaments alone, of which these women
had been plundered, being melted down, produced, in gold, one hundred
and fifty thousand meskals; of a dram and a half each. Among the
articles of the booty, is also described an image of gold, of fifty
thousand meskals, of which the eyes were two pearls, the exquisite
beauty and magnitude of which excited the surprise and admiration of
Kateibah. They were transmitted by him, with a fifth of the spoil to
Hejauje, together with a request that he might be permitted to
distribute, to the troops, the arms which had been found in the place in
great profusion.”^(<a href="#8">8</a>)</p>
<p><em>Samarqand (Farghana)</em></p>
<p>“A breach was, however, at last effected in the walls of the city in AD
712 by the warlike machines of Kateibah; and some of the most daring of
its defenders having fallen by the skill of his archers, the besieged
demanded a cessation of arms to the following day, when they promised to
capitulate. The request was acceded to by Kateibah; and a treaty was the
next day accordingly concluded between him and the prince of Samarkand,
by which the latter engaged for the annual payment of ten millions of
dirhems, and a supply of three thousand slaves; of whom it was
particularly stipulated, that none should either be in a state of
infancy, or ineffective from old age and debility. He further contracted
that the ministers of his religion should be expelled from their temples
and their idols destroyed and burnt; that Kateibah should be allowed to
establish a mosque in the place of the principal temple, in which, to
discharge the duties of his faith… To all this, Ghurek, with whatever
reluctance, was compelled to subscribe, and he proceeded accordingly to
prepare for the reception of Kateibah; who at the period agreed upon,
entered Samarkand with a retinue of four hundred persons, selected from
his own relatives, and the principal commanders of his army. He was met
by Ghurek, with a respect bordering on adoration, and conducted to the
gate of the principal temple, which he immediately entered; and after
performing two rekkauts of the ritual of his faith, directed the images
of pagan worship to be brought before him, for the purpose of being
committed to the flames. From this some of the Turks or Tartars of
Samarkand, endeavouring to dissuade him, by a declaration, that among
the images, there was one, which if any person ventured to consume, that
person should certainly perish; Kateibah informed them, that he should
not shrink from the experiment, and accordingly set fire to the whole
collection with his own hands; it was soon consumed to ashes, and fifty
thousand meskals of gold and silver, collected from the nails which has
been used in the workmanship of the images.”^(<a href="#9">9</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Yã’qûb bin Laith (AD 870-871)</strong></p>
<p>He was a highway robber who succeeded in seizing Khurasan from the
Tãhirid governors of the Abbãsid Caliphate. He founded the short-lived
Saffãrid dynasty.</p>
<p><em>Balkh and Kabul (Afghanistan)</em></p>
<p>“He first took Bãmiãn, which he probably reached by way of Herãt, and
then marched on Balkh where he ruined (the temple) Naushãd. On his way
back from Balkh he attacked Kãbul…^(<a href="#10">10</a>)</p>
<p>“Starting from Panjhîr, the place he is known to have visited, he must
have passed through the capital city of the Hindu Šãhîs to rob the
sacred temple - the reputed place of coronation of the Šãhî rulers-of
its sculptural wealth…^(<a href="#11">11</a>)</p>
<p>“The exact details of the spoil collected from the Kãbul valley are
lacking. The <em>Tãrîkh [-i-Sistãn]</em> records 50 idols of gold and silver
and Mas’udî mentions elephants. The wonder excited in Baghdãd by
elephants and pagan idols forwarded to the Caliph by Ya’qûb also speaks
for their high value.</p>
<p>“The best of our authorities put the date of this event in 257 (870-71).
Tabarî is more precise and says that the idols sent by Ya’qûb reached
Baghdãd in Rabî’ al-Ãkhar, 257 (Feb.-March, 871). Thus the date of the
actual invasion may be placed at the end of AD 870.”^(<a href="#12">12</a>)</p>

<strong>Tãrîkhu&rsquo;l-Hind</strong></p>
<p>“The author, Abû Rîhan Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Bîrûnî al-Khwãrizmî, was
born in about AD 970-71. He was an astronomer, geometrician, historian
and logician. He was sent to Ghazni in an embassy from the Sultãn of
Khwãrizm. On invitation from Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030) he
entered his service, travelled to India and spent forty years in the
country, chiefly in the Punjab. He learnt Sanskrit and translated some
works from that language into Arabic. His history treats of the
literature and learning of the Hindus at the commencement of the
eleventh century.</p>
<p><strong>Jalam ibn Shaiban (Ninth century AD)</strong></p>
<p><em>Multan (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>The Sun Temple at Multan has been described by early Arab geographers
like Sulaimãn, Mas‘ûdî, Istakhrî and Ibn Hauqal who travelled in India
during the ninth and tenth centuries of the Christian era. The Arab
invaders did not destroy it because besides being a rich source of
revenue, it provided protection against Hindu counter-attack. “Mûltan,”
wrote Mas‘ûdî, “is one of the strongest frontier places of the
Musalmãns… In it is the idol also known by the name of
Mûltãn.^(<a href="#13">13</a>) The inhabitants of Sind and India perform
pilgrimages to it from the most distant places; they carry money,
precious stones, aloe wood and all sorts of perfumes there to fulfil
their vows. The greatest part of the revenue of the king of Mûltãn is
derived from the rich presents brought to the idol… When the
unbelievers^(<a href="#14">14</a>) march against Mûltãn and the
faithful ^(<a href="#15">15</a>) do not feel themselves strong enough to oppose
them, they threaten to break their idol, and their enemies immediately
withdraw.”^(<a href="#16">16</a>)</p>
<p>Al-Bîrûnî records: “A famous idol of theirs was that of Multan,
dedicated to the sun, and therefore called <em>Aditya</em>. It was of wood and
covered with red Cordovan leather; in its two eyes were two red rubies.
It is said to have been made in the last <em>Kritayuga</em>… When Muhammad Ibn
Alkasim Ibn Almunabih conquered Multan, he inquired how the town had
become so very flourishing and so many treasures had there been
accumulated, and then he found out that this idol was the cause, for
there came pilgrims from all sides to visit it. Therefore he thought it
best to have the idol where it was, but he hung a piece of cow’s flesh
on its neck by way of mockery. On the same place a mosque was
built. When the Karmatians^(<a href="#17">17</a>) occupied Multan, Jalam Ibn
Shaiban, the usurper, broke the idol into pieces and killed its
priests…”^(<a href="#18">18</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030)</strong></p>
<p><em>Thanesar (Haryana)</em></p>
<p>“The city of Taneshar is highly venerated by Hindus. The idol of that
place is called <em>Cakrasvamin</em>, i.e. the owner of the <em>cakra</em>, a weapon
which we have already described. It is of bronze, and is nearly the size
of a man. It is now lying in the hippodrome in Ghazna, together with the
Lord of Somanath, which is a representation of the <em>penis</em> of Mahadeva,
called <em>Linga</em>.”^(<a href="#19">19</a>)</p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“The linga he raised was the stone of Somnath, for <em>soma</em> means the moon
and <em>natha</em> means <em>master</em>, so that the whole word means <em>master of the
moon</em>. The image was destroyed by the Prince Mahmud, may God be merciful
to him! - AH 416. He ordered the upper part to be broken and the
remainder to be transported to his residence, Ghaznin, with all its
coverings and trappings of gold, jewels, and embroidered garments. Part
of it has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town, together with the
<em>Cakrasvamin</em>, an idol of bronze, that had been brought from Taneshar.
Another part of the idol from Somanath lies before the door of the
mosque of Ghaznin, on which people rub their feet to clean them from
dirt and wet.”^(<a href="#20">20</a>)</p>

<strong>Kitãbu’l-Yamînî</strong></p>
<p>The author of this history in Arabic was Abû Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad
al Jabbãru’l-‘Utbî. The family from Utba had held important offices
under the Sãmãnîs of Bukhara. ‘Utbi himself became Secretary to Sultãn
Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030). His work comprises the whole of the
reign of Subuktigîn and that of Sultãn Mahmûd down to the year AD 1020.
He lived a few years longer. Persian translations of this history are
known as <em>Tarjuma-i-Yamînî</em> or <em>Tãrîkh-i-Yamînî</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Amîr Subuktigîn of Ghazni (AD 977-997)</strong></p>
<p><em>Lamghan (Afghanistan)</em></p>
<p>“The Amîr marched out towards Lamghãn, which is a city celebrated for
its great strength and abounding wealth. He conquered it and set fire to
the places in its vicinity which were inhabited by infidels, and
demolishing idol temples, he established Islãm in them. He marched and
captured other cities and killed the polluted wretches, destroying the
idolaters and gratifying the Musalmãns.”^(<a href="#21">21</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030)</strong></p>
<p><em>Narain (Rajasthan)</em></p>
<p>“The Sultãn again resolved on an expedition to Hind, and marched towards
Nãrãîn, urging his horses and moving over ground, hard and soft, until
he came to the middle of Hind, where he reduced chiefs, who, up to that
time obeyed no master, overturned their idols, put to the sword the
vagabonds^(<a href="#22">22</a>) of that country, and with delay and circumspection
proceeded to accomplish his design…”^(<a href="#23">23</a>)</p>
<p><em>Nardin (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>“After the Sultãn had purified Hind from idolatry, and raised mosques
therein, he determined to invade the capital of Hind to punish those who
kept idols and would not acknowledge the unity of God… He marched with a
large army in the year AH 404 (AD 1013) during a dark night…^(<a href="#24">24</a>)</p>
<p>“A stone was found there in the temple of the great Budda on which an
inscription was written purporting that the temple had been founded
fifty thousand years ago. The Sultãn was surprised at the ignorance of
these people, because those who believe in the true faith represent that
only seven thousand years have elapsed since the creation of the world,
and the signs of resurrection are even now approaching. The Sultãn asked
his wise men the meaning of this inscription and they all concurred in
saying that it was false, and no faith was to be put in the evidence of
a stone.”^(<a href="#25">25</a>)</p>
<p><em>Thanesar (Haryana)</em></p>
<p>“The chief of Tãnesar was… obstinate in his infidelity and denial of
God. So the Sultãn marched against him with his valiant warriors, for
the purpose of planting the standards of Islãm and extirpating
idolatry…^(<a href="#26">26</a>)</p>
<p>“The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously, that the stream was
discoloured, not withstanding its purity, and people were unable to
drink it… The victory was gained by God’s grace, who has established
Islãm for ever as the best of religions, notwithstanding that idolaters
revolt against it… Praise be to God, the protector of the world, for the
honour he bestows upon Islãm and Musulmãns.”^(<a href="#27">27</a>)</p>
<p><em>Mathura (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The Sultãn then departed from the environs of the city, in which was a
temple of the Hindûs. The name of this place was Maharatul Hind… On both
sides of the city there were a thousand houses, to which idol temples
were attached, all strengthened from top to bottom by rivets of iron,
and all made of masonry work…^(<a href="#28">28</a>)</p>
<p>“In the middle of the city there was a temple larger and firmer than the
rest, which can neither be described nor painted. The Sultãn thus wrote
respecting it: - ‘If any should wish to construct a building equal to
this, he would not be able to do it without expending an hundred
thousand, thousand red dînãrs, and it would occupy two hundred years
even though the most experienced and able workmen were employed’… The
Sultãn gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naptha and
fire, and levelled with the ground.”^(<a href="#29">29</a>)</p>
<p><em>Kanauj (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“In Kanauj there were nearly ten thousand temples, which the idolaters
falsely and absurdly represented to have been founded by their ancestors
two or three hundred thousand years ago… Many of the inhabitants of the
place fled and were scattered abroad like so many wretched widows and
orphans, from the fear which oppressed them, in consequence of
witnessing the fate of their deaf and dumb idols. Many of them thus
effected their escape, and those who did not fly were put to
death,”^(<a href="#30">30</a>)</p>

<strong>Dîwãn-i-Salmãn</strong></p>
<p>The author, Khwãjah Mas‘ûd bin Sa‘d bin Salmãn, was a poet. He wrote
poems in praise of the Ghaznavid Sultãns – Mas‘ûd, Ibrãhîm and Bahrãm
Shãh. He died sometime between AD 1126 and 1131.</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Abu’l Muzaffar Ibrãhîm (AD 1059-1099)</strong></p>
<p>“As power and the strength of a lion was bestowed upon Ibrãhîm by the
Almighty, he made over to him the well-populated country of Hindustãn
and gave him 40,000 valiant horsemen to take the country, in which there
were more than 1000 <em>rãîs</em>… Its length extends from Lahore to the
Euphrates, and its breadth from Kashmîr to the borders of Sîstãn… The
army of the king destroyed at one time a thousand temples of idols,
which had each been built for more than a thousand years. How can I
describe the victories of the king…”^(<a href="#31">31</a>)</p>
<p><em>Jalandhar (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>“The narrative of thy battles eclipses the stories of Rustam and
Isfandiyãr. Thou didst bring an army in one night from Dhangãn to
Jãlandhar… Thou didst direct but one assault and by that alone brought
destruction upon the country. By the morning meal not one soldier, not
one <em>Brãhman</em>, remained unkilled or uncaptured. Their beads were severed
by the carriers of swords. Their houses were levelled with the ground
with flaming fire… Thou has secured victory to the country and to
religion, for amongst the Hindus this achievement will be remembered
till the day of resurrection.”^(<a href="#32">32</a>)</p>
<p><em>Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“Thou didst depart with a thousand joyful anticipations on a holy
expedition, and didst return having achieved a thousand victories… On
this journey the army destroyed a thousand idol-temples and thy
elephants trampled over more than a hundred strongholds. Thou didst
march thy arm to Ujjain; Mãlwã trembled and fled from thee… On the way
to Kãlinjãr thy pomp obscured the light of day. The lip of infidelity
became dry through fear of thee, the eye of plural-worship became
blind…”^(<a href="#33">33</a>)</p>

<strong>Chach-Nãmah</strong></p>
<p>This Persian history was translated from Arabic by Muhammad ‘Alî bin
Hamîd bin Abû Bakr Kûfî in the time of Nãsiru’d-Dîn Qabãcha, a slave of
Muhammad Ghurî, who contested the throne of Delhi with Shamsu’d-Dîn
Iltutmish (AD 1210-1236). The translator who lived at Uccha had gone to
Alor and Bhakkar in search of accounts of the Arab conquest. He met a
Maulãna who had inherited a history written in Arabic by one of his
ancestors. The translation in Persian followed because Kûfî found that
the Hijãjî Arabic of the original was little understood by people in
those days while the work was “a mine of wisdom.” The Arabic original
has been lost. The author remains unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Muhammad bin Qãsim (AD 712-715)</strong></p>
<p><em>Nirun (Sindh)</em></p>
<p>“Muhammad built at Nîrûn a mosque on the site of the temple of Budh, and
ordered prayers to be proclaimed in the Muhammadan fashion and appointed
an Imãm.”^(<a href="#34">34</a>)</p>
<p><em>Siwistan and Sisam (Sindh)</em></p>
<p>Muhammad bin Qãsim wrote to al-Hajjãj, the governor of Iraq: “The forts
of Siwistãn and Sîsam have been already taken. The nephew of Dãhir, his
warriors, and principal officers have been despatched, and infidels
converted to Islãm or destroyed. Instead of idol temples, mosques and
other places of worship have been built, pulpits have been erected, the
Khutba is read, the call to prayers is raised so that devotions are
performed at the stated hours. The takbîr and praise to the Almighty God
are offered every morning and evening.”^(<a href="#35">35</a>)</p>
<p><em>Alor (Sindh)</em></p>
<p>“Muhammad Kãsim then entered and all the town people came to the temple
of Nobhãr, and prostrated themselves before an idol. Muhammad Kãsim
enquired: ‘Whose house is this, in which all the people high and low are
respectfully kneeling and bowing down.’ They replied: ‘This is an
idol-house called Nobhãr.’ Then, by Muhammad Kãsim’s order, the temple
was opened. Entering it with his officers he saw an equestrian statue.
The body of the idol was made of marble or alabaster, and it had on its
arms golden bracelets, set with jewels and rubies. Muhammad Kãsim
stretched his hand and took off a bracelet from one of the idol’s arms.
Then he asked the keeper of the Budh temple Nobhãr: ‘Is this your idol?’
‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘but it had two bracelets on, and one is
missing.’ ‘Well’ said Muhammad Kãsim, ‘cannot your god know who has
taken away his bracelet?’ The keeper bent his head down. Muhammad Kãsim
laughed and returned the bracelet to him, and he fixed it again on the
idol’s arm.”^(<a href="#36">36</a>)</p>
<p><em>Multan (Punjab)</em></p>
<p>“Then all the great and principal inhabitants of the city assembled
together, and silver to the weight of sixty thousand dirams was
distributed and every horseman got a share of four hundred dirams
weight. After this, Muhammad Kãsim said that some plan should be devised
for realizing the money to be sent to the Khalîfa. He was pondering over
this, when suddenly a Brahman came and said, ‘Heathenism is now at an
end, the temples are thrown down, the world has received the light of
Islãm, and mosques are built instead of idol temples. I have heard from
the elders of Multãn that in ancient times there was a chief in this
city whose name was Jîbawîn, and who was a descendent of the Rãî of
Kashmîr. He was a Brahman and a monk, he strictly followed his religion,
and always occupied his time in worshipping idols. When his treasures
exceeded all limits and computation, he made a reservoir on the eastern
side of Multãn, which was hundred yards square.  In the middle of it he
built a temple fifty yards square, and he made a chamber in which he
concealed forty copper jars each of which was filled with African gold
dust. A treasure of three hundred and thirty <em>mans</em> of gold was buried
there. Over it there is an idol made of red gold, and trees are planted
round the reservoir.’ It is related by historians, on the authority of
‘Ali bin Muhammad who had heard it from Abû Muhammad Hinduî^(<a href="#37">37</a>)
that Muhammad Kãsim arose and with his counsellors, guards and
attendants, went to the temple. He saw there an idol made of gold, and
its two eye were bright red rubies.</p>
<p>“……Muhammad Kãsim ordered the idol to be taken up. Two hundred and
thirty <em>mans</em> of gold were obtained, and forty jars filled with gold
dust… This gold and the image were brought to treasury together with the
gems and pearls and treasures which were obtained from the plunder of
Multãn.”^(<a href="#38">38</a>)</p>
<p><em>Jãnakî’s Evidence</em></p>
<p>Jãnakî was one of the daughters of King Dãhir of Sindh. She was captured
along with her sister and sent to the Khalîfa at Baghdad. When the
Khalîfa invited Jãnakî to share his bed, she lied to him that she had
already been violated by Muhammad bin Qãsim. Her sister supported her
statement. The Khalîfa ordered that Muhammad be sewed up in raw hide and
sent to his court. Muhammad was already dead when the chest containing
him arrived in Baghdad. Jãnakî accused the Khalîfa of having killed one
of his great generals without making proper enquiry. She said:</p>
<p>“The king has committed a very grievous mistake, for he ought not, on
account of two slave girls, to have destroyed a person who had taken
captive a hundred thousand modest women like us… and who instead of
temples had erected mosques, pulpits and minarets…”^(<a href="#39">39</a>)</p>

to Multãn. After he had crossed the desert he perceived on one side a

dignitary under Sultãn Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Balban (AD 1266-1286). He himself
became a companion of Balban’s son, Prince Muhammad, and stayed at
Multãn till the prince was killed in a battle with the Mongols. Reputed
to be the dearest disciple of Shykh Nizãmu’d-Dîn Auliyã‘, he became the
lick-spittle of whoever came out victorious in the contest for the
throne at Delhi. He became a court poet of Balban’s successor, Sultãn
Kaiqubãd (AD 1288-1290) and wrote his <em>Qirãnu’s S‘ãdaîn</em> in the Sultãn’s
praise in AD 1289. Next, he joined Sultãn Jalãlu’d-Dîn Khaljî (AD
1290-1296) as a court poet after the latter murdered Kaiqubãd. He wrote
in 1291 the <em>Miftãhu‘l-Futûh</em> which describes Jalãlu’d-Dîn’s
victories.</p>

<p>“The Sultãn reached Jhãin in the afternoon of the third day and stayed
in the palace of the Rãya… He greatly enjoyed his stay for some time.
Coming out, he took a round of the gardens and temples. The idols he saw
amazed him… Next day he got those idols of gold smashed with stones. The
pillars of wood were burnt down by his order… A cry rose from the
temples as if a second Mahmûd had taken birth. Two idols were made of
brass, one of which weighed nearly a thousand mans. He got both of them
broken, and the pieces were distributed among his people so that they
may throw them at the door of the Masjid on their return [to
Delhi]…”^(<a href="#64">64</a>)</p>

<p>“Three days after this, the king entered Jhãin at midday and occupied
the private apartment of the <em>rãi</em>… He then visited the temples, which
were ornamented with elaborate work in gold and silver. Next day he went
again to the temples, and ordered their destruction, as well as of the
fort, and set fire to the palace, and ‘thus made hell of
paradise’… While the soldiers sought every opportunity of plundering,
the Shãh was engaged in burning the temples, and destroying the idols.
There were two bronze idols of Brahma each of which weighed more than a

distributed amongst the officers, with orders to throw them down at the

descended into the earth like ants. He departed towards the garden of

notables who welcomed ‘Alãu’d-Dîn when the latter reached Delhi with the
head of the late king held aloft on the point of a spear. He completed
this history in AD 1311. It is famous for its flowery language and
figures of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn ‘Alãu’d-Dîn Khaljî (AD 1296-1316)</strong></p>
<p><em>Delhi</em></p>
<p>“He started his building programme with the Jãmi‘ Hazrat mosque…
Thereafter he decided to build a second <em>mînãr</em> opposite to the lofty
<em>mînãr</em> of the Jãmi‘ Masjid, which <em>mînãr</em> is unparalleled in the
world…^(<a href="#68">68</a>) He ordered the circumference of the new <em>mînãr</em> to be
double that of the old one. People were sent out in all directions in
search of stones. Some of them broke the hills into pieces. Some others
proved sharper than steel in breaking the temples of the infidels.
Wherever these temples were bent in prayers, they were made to do
prostration.”^(<a href="#69">69</a>)</p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“On Wednesday, the 20th of Jamãdî-ul Awwal in AH 698 (23 February,
1299), the Sultãn sent an order to the manager of the armed forces for
despatching the army of Islãm to Gujarãt so that the temple of Somnãt on
its shore could be destroyed. Ulugh Khãn was put in charge of the
expedition. When the royal army reached that province, it won a victory
after great slaughter. Thereafter the Khãn-i-‘Ãzam went with his army to
the sea-shore and besieged Somnãt which was a place of worship for the
Hindûs. The army of Islãm broke the idols and the biggest idol was sent
to the court of the Sultãn.”^(<a href="#70">70</a>)</p>
<p>Professor Mohammed Habib’s translation provides a fuller version. It
reads: “So the temple of Somnath was made to bow towards the Holy Mecca;
and as the temple lowered its head and jumped into the sea, you may say
that the building first said its prayers and then had a bath… It seemed
as if the tongue of the Imperial sword explained the meaning of the
text: ‘So he (Abraham) broke them (the idols) into pieces except the
chief of them, that haply they may return to it.’ Such a pagan country,
the Mecca of the infidels, now became the Medina of Islam. The followers
of Abraham now acted as guides in place of the Brahman leaders. The
robust-hearted true believers rigorously broke all idols and temples
wherever they found them. Owing to the war, <em>‘takbir,’</em> and <em>‘shahadat’</em>
was heard on every side; even the idols by their breaking affirmed the
existence of God. In this ancient land of infidelity the call to prayers
rose so high that it was heard in Baghdad and Madain (Ctesiphon) while
the ‘Ala’ proclamation (<em>Khutba</em>) resounded in the dome of Abraham and
over the water of Zamzam… The sword of Islam purified the land as the
Sun purifies the earth.”^(<a href="#71">71</a>)</p>

<p>“On Tuesday, the 3rd of Ziqãd in AH 700 (10 July, 1301), the strong fort
[of Ranthambhor] was conquered. Jhãin which was the abode of the
infidels, became a new city for Musalmãns. The temple of Bãhirdev was
the first to be destroyed. Subsequently, all other abodes of idolatry
were destroyed. Many strong temples which would have remained unshaken
even by the trumpet blown on the Day of Judgment, were levelled with the
ground when swept by the wind of Islãm.”^(<a href="#72">72</a>)</p>
<p><em>Warangal (Andhra Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“When the blessed canopy had been fixed about a mile from the gate of
Arangal, the tents around the fort were pitched together so closely that
the head of a needle could not go between them… Orders were issued that
every man should erect behind his own tent a <em>kathgar</em>, that is wooden
defence. The trees were cut with axes and felled, notwithstanding their
groans; and the Hindus, who worship trees, could not at that time come
to the rescue of their idols, so that every cursed tree which was in
that capital of idolatry was cut down to the roots…^(<a href="#73">73</a>)</p>
<p>“During the attack, the catapults were busily plied on both sides…
‘Praise be to God for his exaltation of the religion of Muhammad. It is
not to be doubted that stones are worshipped by Gabrs,^(<a href="#74">74</a>) but
as the stones did no service to them, they only bore to heaven the
futility of that worship, and at the same time prostrated their devotees
upon earth’…”^(<a href="#75">75</a>)</p>

on the left hand the army has conquered from sea to sea, and several
capitals of the gods of the Hindûs in which Satanism had prevailed since
the time of the Jinns, have been demolished. All these impurities of
infidelity have been cleansed by the Sultãn’s destruction of idol
temples, beginning with his first expedition against Deogîr, so that the
flames of the light of the law illumine all these unholy countries, and
places for the criers to prayers are exalted on high, and prayers are
read in mosques. God be praised!”^(<a href="#76">76</a>)</p>

<p>“After returning to Bîrdhûl, he again pursued the Rãjã to Kandûr… The

was then ascertained that he had fled to Jãlkota… There the Malik
closely pursued him, but he had again escaped to the jungles, which the
Malik found himself unable to penetrate, and he therefore returned to
Kandûr… Here he heard that in Brahmastpûrî there was a golden idol,
round which many elephants wore stabled. The Malik started on a night
expedition against this place, and in the morning seized no less then
two hundred and fifty elephants. He then determined on razing the
beautiful temple to the ground – ‘you might say that it was the Paradise
of Shaddãd which, after being lost, those hellites had found, and that
it was the golden Lanka of Rãm,’ – ‘the roof was covered with rubies and
emeralds’, - ‘in short, it was the holy place of the Hindûs, which the
Malik dug up from its foundations with the greatest care… and heads of
the Brahmans and idolaters danced from their necks and fell to the
ground at their feet,’ and blood flowed in torrents. ‘The stone idol
called Ling Mahãdeo which had been a long time established at that place
and on which the women of the infidels rubbed their vaginas for
[sexual] satisfaction, these, up to this time, the kick of the horse
of Islãm had not attempted to break.’ The Musalmãns destroyed all the
lings, ‘and Deo Narain fell down, and the other gods who had fixed their
seats there raised their feet, and jumped so high, that at one leap they
reached the fort of Lanka, and in that affright the lings themselves
would have fled had they had any legs to stand on.’ Much gold and
valuable jewels fell into the hands of the Musalmãns, who returned to
the royal canopy, after executing their holy project, on the 13th of
Zî-l Ka’da, AH 710 (April 1311 AD). They destroyed an the temples at

arrived at the city of Mathra (Madura), the dwelling place of the
brother of the Rãî Sundar Pãndyã. They found the city empty, for the Rãî

<strong>Dawal Rãnî-Khizr Khãnî</strong></p>

captured daughter of the last Hindu King of Gujarat, and Khizr Khãn, the
eldest son of ‘Alãu’d-Dîn Khaljî. It also describes Muslim history in
India upto the reign of ‘Alãu’d-Dîn Khaljî, including Malik Kãfûr’s
expedition to South India in AD 1310.</p>

<p>“There was another <em>rãî</em> in those parts, whose rule extended over sea
and land, a Brahmin named Pandyã Gurû. He had many cities in his
possession, and his capital was Fatan, where there was a temple with an
idol in it laden with jewels… The <em>rãî</em>, when the army of the Sultãn
arrived at Fatan, fled away, and what can an army do without its
leader?  The Musalmãns in his service sought protection from the king’s
army, and they were made happy with the kind of reception they met. 500
elephants were taken. They then struck the idol with an iron hatchet,
and opened its head. Although it was the very Kibla of the accursed

was 67 years old. It celebrates the reign of Sultãn Mubãrak Shãh Khaljî.
It consists of nine(<em>nuh</em>) <em>siphirs</em> (parts). In <em>Siphir</em> III, he says
that the Hindus “worship&hellip;stones, beasts, plants and the sun, but they
recognize that these things are creations of God and adore them simply

who traded between Kirman in Iran and Lahore, and who became a disciple
of Shykh Farîdu’d-Dîn Ganj-i-Shakar, the Sufi luminary of Ajodhan near
Multan. His father was also a disciple of the same Sufi. The family
travelled to Delhi after Shykh Farîd’s death and became devoted to Shykh
Nizãmu’d-Dîn Auliyã‘. Mîr Khwurd was forced to migrate to Daulatabad by
Sultãn Muhammad bin Tughlaq but allowed to return to Delhi after some
time. It was then that he wrote this detailed biography of the Auliyã‘

<p>“The other miracle is that before his arrival the whole of Hindustan was
submerged by unbelief and idol-worship. Every haughty man in Hind
pronounced himself to be Almighty God and considered himself as the
partner of God. All the people of India used to prostrate themselves
before stones, idols, trees, animals, cows and cow-dung. Because of the
darkness of unbelief over this land their hearts were locked and
hardened.</p>
<p>“All India was ignorant of orders of religion and law. All were ignorant
of Allãh and His Prophet. None had seen the Ka‘ba. None had heard of the
Greatness of Allãh.</p>
<p>“Because of his coming, the, Sun of real believers, the helper of
religion, Mu‘în al-dîn, the darkness of unbelief in this land was
illumined by the light of Islam.</p>

there were the sayings of the idol-worshippers, there is the sound of
‘Allãhu Akbar’.</p>
<p>“The descendants of those who were converted to Islam in this land will
live until the Day of Judgement; so too will those who bring others into

shape and admirable workmanship… Its head was adorned with a crown set
with gold and rubies and pearls and other precious stones… and a
necklace of large shining pearls, like the belt of Orion, depended from
the shoulder towards the side of the body.</p>
<p>“The Muhammadan soldiers plundered all these jewels and rapidly set
themselves to demolish the idol. The surviving infidels were deeply
affected with grief, and they engaged ‘to pay a thousand pieces of gold’
as ransom for the idol, but they were indignantly rejected, and the idol
was destroyed, and ‘its limbs, which were anointed with ambergris and
perfumed, were cut off. The fragments were conveyed to Delhi, and the
entrance of the Jãmi‘ Masjid was paved with them, that people might
remember and talk of this brilliant victory.’ Praise be to God, the Lord
of the worlds. Amen!”^(<a href="#83">83</a>)</p>

<p>“The Sultãn is not slack in <em>jihãd</em>. He never lets go of his spear or
bridle in pursuing <em>jihãd</em> by land and sea routes. This is his main
occupation which engages his eyes and ears. He has spent vast sums for
the establishment of the faith and the spread of Islãm in these lands,
as a result of which the light of Islãm has reached the inhabitants and
the flash of the true faith brightened among them. Fire
temples^(<a href="#85">85</a>) have been destroyed and the images and idols of Budd
have been broken, and the lands have been freed from those who were not
included in the <em>dãru’l Islãm</em>, that is, those who had refused to become
<em>zimmîs</em>. Islãm has been spread by him in the far east and has reached
the point of sunrise. In the words of ‘Abû Nasr al-Ãinî, he has carried
the flags of the followers of Islãm where they had never reached before
and where no chapter or verse (of the Qur’ãn) had ever been
recited. Thereafter he got mosques and places of worship erected, and
music replaced by call to prayers (<em>azãn</em>), and the incantations of
fire-worshippers stopped by recitations of the Qur’ãn. He directed the
people of Islãm towards the citadels of the infidels and, by the grace
of Allãh, made them (the believers) inheritors of wealth and land and
that country which they (the believers) had never trodden
upon…^(<a href="#86">86</a>)</p>
<p>“The Sultãn who is ruling at present has achieved that which had not
been achieved so far by any king. He has achieved victory, supremacy,

Battûta. He belonged to an Arab family which was settled in Spain since
AD 1312. His grandfather and father enjoyed the reputation of scholars
and theologians. He himself was a great scholar who travelled
extensively and over many lands. He came to India in 1325 and visited
many places - east, west, north and south - till he left in 1346. India
during this period was ruled by Muhammad bin Tughlaq with whom Ibn
Battûta came in close contact. He was very fond of sampling Hindu girls
from different parts of India. They were presented to him by the Sultãn
and other Muslim big-wigs during his sojourn in various places. He also
married Muslim women wherever he stayed, and divorced them before his
departure. He finished his book in 1355 after reaching Fez in Morocco
where his family lived after migration from Spain.</p>
<p><em>Lahari Bandar (Sindh)</em></p>
<p>“One day I rode in company with ‘Alã-ul-mulk and arrived at a plain
called Tarna at a distance of seven miles from the city. There I saw
innumerable stone images and animals, many of which had undergone a
change, the original shape being obliterated.^(<a href="#89">89</a>) Some were
reduced to a head, others to a foot and so on. Some of the stones were
shaped like grain, wheat, peas, beans and lentils. And there were traces
of a house which contained a chamber built of hewn stone, the whole of
which looked like one solid mass. Upon it was a statue in the form of a
man, the only difference being that its head was long, its mouth was
towards a side of its face and its hands at its back like a captive’s.
There were pools of water from which an extremely bad smell came. Some
of the walls bore Hindî inscriptions. ‘Alã-ul-mulk told me that the
historians assume that on this site there was a big city, most of the
inhabitants of which were notorious. They were changed into stone. The
petrified human form on the platform in the house mentioned above was
that of their king. The house still goes by the name of ‘the king’s
house’. It is presumed that the Hindî inscriptions, which some of the
walls bear, give the history of the destruction of the inhabitants of
this city. The destruction took place about a thousand years
ago…”^(<a href="#90">90</a>)</p>

knew the great Qur’ãn came to them… He stayed amongst them and God
opened the heart of the king to Islãm and he accepted it before the end
of the month; and his wives, children and courtiers followed suit… They
broke to pieces the idols and razed the idol-house to the ground. On
this the islanders embraced Islãm and sent missionaries to the rest of
the islands, the inhabitants of which also became Muslims. The westerner
stood in high regard with them, and they accepted his cult which was
that of Imãm Mãlik. May God be pleased with him!  And on account of him

<p>The author, Ziau’d-Dîn Baranî was born in AH 684 (AD 1285-86) at Baran,
now known as Bulandshahar, in Uttar Pradesh. His ancestors, paternal as
well as maternal, had occupied important positions in the reigns of
Sultãn Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Balban (AD 1266-1286) and the Khaljîs. His uncle
was a confidant of ‘Alau’d-Dîn Khaljî (AD 1296-1316). Barani became a
friend of Amîr Khusrû and a disciple of Nizãmu’d-Dîn Auliyã‘, the
renowned Chishtî saint of Delhi. His prosperity continued in the reign
of Sultãn Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Tughlaq (AD 1320-1325) and he became a favourite
of Sultãn Muhammad bin Tughlaq (AD 1325-1351). But he fell from favour
with the rise of Sultãn Fîrûz Tughlaq (AD 1351-1388) and was imprisoned
for five months for some offence. He completed this history in AD 1357.
It covers a period of 82 years, from AD 1265 onwards. He wrote several
other books among which <em>Fatwa-i-Jahãndãrî</em> is famous for its tenets
regarding how an Islamic state should be run. Baranî’s ideal ruler was
Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni. He exhorted Muslim rulers to follow Mahmûd’s
example in their treatment of Hindus, for whom he often uses very foul
language.</p>

<strong>Tãrîkh-i-Fîrûz Shãhî</strong></p>
<p>The author, Shams Sirãj Afîf or Shamsu’d-Dîn bin Siraju’d-Dîn, became a
courtier of Sultãn Fîrûz Shãh Tughlaq and undertook to complete the
aforementioned history of Baranî who had stopped at the sixth year of
Fîrûz Shãh’s reign.</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Fîrûz Shãh Tughlaq (AD 1351-1388)</strong></p>
<p><em>Puri (Orissa)</em></p>
<p>“The Sultãn left Banãrasî with the intention of pursuing the Rãî of
Jãjnagar, who had fled to an island in the river… News was then brought
that in the <em>jangal</em> were seven elephants, and one old she-elephant,
which was very fierce. The Sultãn resolved upon endeavouring to capture
these elephants before continuing the pursuit of the Rãî&hellip; ^(<a href="#97">97</a>)</p>
<p>“After the hunt was over, the Sultãn directed his attention to the Rãî
of Jãjnagar, and entering the palace where he dwelt he found many fine
buildings. It is reported that inside the Rãî’s fort, there was a stone
idol which the infidels called Jagannãth, and to which they paid their
devotions. Sultãn Fîroz, in emulation of Mahmûd Subuktigîn, having
rooted up the idol, carried it away to Delhi where he placed it in an
ignominious position…”^(<a href="#98">98</a>)</p>
<p><em>Nagarkot Kangra (Himachal Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The idol, Jwãlãmukhî, much worshipped by the infidels, was situated on
the road to Nagarkot… Some of the infidels have reported that Sultãn
Fîroz went specially to see this idol and held a golden umbrella over
it. But the author was informed by his respected father, who was in the
Sultãn’s retinue, that the infidels slandered the Sultãn, who was a
religious, God-fearing man, who, during the whole forty years of his
reign, paid strict obedience to the law, and that such an action was
impossible. The fact is, that when he went to see the idol, all the
<em>rãîs, rãnas</em> and <em>zamîndãrs</em> who accompanied him were summoned into his
presence, when he addressed them, saying, ‘O fools and weak-minded, how
can ye pray to and worship this stone, for our holy law tells us that
those who oppose the decrees of our religion, will go to hell?’ The
Sultãn held the idol in the deepest detestation, but the infidels, in
the blindness of their delusion, have made this false statement against
him. Other infidels have said that Sultãn Muhammad Shãh bin Tughlik Shãh
held an umbrella over the same idol, but this is also a lie; and good
Muhammadans should pay no heed to such statements. These two Sultãns
were sovereigns especially chosen by the Almighty from among the
faithful, and in the whole course of their reigns, wherever they took an
idol temple they broke and destroyed it; how, then, can such assertions
be true? The infidels must certainly have lied!”^(<a href="#99">99</a>)</p>
<p><em>Delhi</em></p>
<p>“A report was brought to the Sultãn that there was in Delhi an old
Brahman (<em>zunãr dãr</em>) who persisted in publicly performing the worship
of idols in his house; and that people of the city, both Musulmãns and
Hindus, used to resort to his house to worship the idol. The Brahman had
constructed a wooden tablet (<em>muhrak</em>), which was covered within and
without with paintings of demons and other objects… An order was
accordingly given that the Brahman, with his tablet, should be brought
into the presence of the Sultãn at Fîrozãbãd. The judges and doctors and
elders and lawyers were summoned, and the case of the Brahman was
submitted for their opinion. Their reply was that the provisions of the
Law were clear: the Brahman must either become a Musulmãn or be burned.
The true faith was declared to the Brahman, and the right course pointed
out, but he refused to accept it. Orders were given for raising a pile
of faggots before the door of the <em>darbãr</em>. The Brahman was tied hand
and foot and cast into it; the tablet was thrown on top and the pile was
lighted. The writer of this book was present at the <em>darbãr</em> and
witnessed the execution. The tablet of the Brahman was lighted in two
places, at his head and at his feet; the wood was dry, and the fire
first reached his feet, and drew from him a cry, but the flames quickly
enveloped his head and consumed him. Behold the Sultãn’s strict
adherence to law and rectitude, how he would not deviate in the least
from its decrees!”^(<a href="#100">100</a>)</p>

travellers…^(<a href="#101">101</a>)</p>
<p>“The troops which had been appointed for the destruction of places
around Jãjnagar, ended the conceit of the infidels by means of the sword
and the spear. Wherever there were temples and idols in that area, they
were trampled under the hoofs of the horses of Musalmãns…^(<a href="#102">102</a>)</p>

<strong>Futûhãt-i-Fîrûz Shãhî</strong></p>
<p>This small history was written by Sultãn Fîrûz Shãh Tughlaq (AD
1351-1388) himself. The writer of <em>Tabqãt-i-Akbarî</em>, Nizãm’ud-Dîn Ahmad,
a 16th century historian, says that the Sultãn had got the eight
chapters of his work inscribed on eight slabs of stone which were fixed
on eight sides of the octagonal dome of a building near the Jãmi‘ Masjid
at Fîrûzãbãd.</p>
<p><em>Prayers for Temple-destroyers of the Past</em></p>
<p>“The next matter which by God’s help I accomplished, was the repetition
of names and titles of former sovereigns which had been omitted from the
prayers of Sabbaths and Feasts. The names of those sovereigns of Islãm,
under whose happy fortune and favour infidel countries had been
conquered, whose banners had waved over many a land, under whom
<em>idol-temples had been demolished</em>, and mosques and pulpits built and
exalted, the fragrant creed had been extended, and the people of Islãm
had waxen strong and warlike, the names of these men had fallen into
neglect and oblivion. So I decreed that according to established custom
their names and titles should be rehearsed in the khutba and aspirations
offered for the remission of their sins.”^(<a href="#104">104</a>)</p>
<p><em>Delhi and Environs</em></p>
<p>“The Hindus and idol-worshippers had agreed to pay the money for
toleration (<em>zar-i zimmiya</em>) and had consented to the poll-tax (<em>jizya</em>)
in return for which they and their families enjoyed security. These
people now erected new idol-temples in the city and the environs in
opposition to the Law of the Prophet which declares that such temples
are not to be tolerated. Under divine guidance I destroyed these
edifices and I killed those leaders of infidelity who seduced others
into error, and the lower orders I subjected to stripes and
chastisement, until this abuse was entirely abolished. The following is
an instance:- In the village of Malûh^(<a href="#105">105</a>) there is a tank
which they call <em>kund</em> (tank). Here they had built idol-temples and on
certain days the Hindus were accustomed to proceed thither on horseback,
and wearing arms. Their women and children also went out in palankins
and carts. There they assembled in thousands and performed idol-worship…
When intelligence of this came to my ears my religious feelings prompted
me at once to put a stop to this scandal and offence to the religion of
Islãm. On the day of the assembly I went there in person and I ordered
that the leaders of these people and the promoters of this abomination
should be put to death. I forbade the infliction of any severe
punishments on Hindus in general, but I destroyed their idol-temples,
and instead thereof raised mosques. I founded two flourishing towns
(<em>kasba</em>), one called Tughlikpûr, the other Sãlãrpûr. Where infidels and
idolaters worshipped idols, Musulmãns now, by God’s mercy, perform their
devotions to the true God. Praises of God and the summons to prayer are
now heard there, and that place which was formerly the home of infidels
has become the habitation of the faithful, who there repeat their creed
and offer up their praises to God.</p>
<p>“Information was brought to me that some Hindus had erected a new idol
temple in the village of Sãlihpûr, and were performing worship to their
idols. I sent some persons there to destroy the idol temple, and put a
stop to their pernicious incitements to error.”^(<a href="#106">106</a>)</p>
<p><em>Gohana (Haryana)</em></p>
<p>“Some Hindûs had erected a new idol-temple in the village of Kohãna, and
the idolaters used to assemble there and perform their idolatrous rites.
These people were seized and brought before me. I ordered that the
perverse conduct of the leaders of this wickedness should be publicly
proclaimed, and that they should be put to death before the gate of the
palace. I also ordered that the infidel books, the idols, and the
vessels used in their worship, which had been taken with them, should
all be publicly burnt. The others were restrained by threats and
punishments, as a warning to all men, that no zimmî could follow such
wicked practices in a Musulmãn country.”^(<a href="#107">107</a>)</p>

destruction, he ordered the nose of the image of Jagannãth to be
perforated and disgraced it by casting it down on the ground. They dug
out other idols, which were worshipped by the polytheists in the kingdom
of Jãjnagar, and overthrew them as they did the image of Jagannãth, for
being laid in front of the mosques along the path of the Sunnis and way
of the <em>musallis</em> (the multitude who offer prayers) and stretched them

<p>“An anecdote relating to Shaikh Jalalu’d-Din’s stay in Deva Mahal reads
like other stock-in-trade stories and fairytales. It was related by such
an authority as Gisu Daraz. According to him Shaikh Jalalu’d-Din stayed
at Pandua in the house of a flower vendor. On the day of his arrival, he
found each of the house members crying. On enquiry he was told there was
a demon in the temple who daily ate a young man. It was the king’s duty
to provide the demon with his daily food. On that day it was the turn of
the young son in the family. The Shaikh requested them to send him in
place of their son but they refused to accept the offer for fear of the
king. The Shaikh, then followed the young man to the temple and killed
the demon with a single blow from his staff. When the king accompanied
by his retinue reached the temple to worship the demon they were amazed
to find the demon killed and an old man dressed in black with his head
covered with a blanket. The Shaikh invited them to see the fate with
their god. The sight of their vanquished idol prompted them to accept
Islam.”^(<a href="#116">116</a>)</p>

<p>The author, Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Muhammad bin Humãmu’d-Dîn, is known as
Khondmîr. He was the son of Mîrkhond, the author of the famous Persian
history, <em>Rauzatu’s-Safa</em>. Born at Herat in AD 1475 he reached Agra in
1528-29 when he was introduced to Bãbur. He accompanied Bãbur in his
expedition to Bengal and Humãyûn in his expedition to Gujarat where he
died in 1534-35. His <em>Khulãstu’l-Akhbãr</em> is a history of Asia brought
down to AD 1471. The <em>Habîbu’s-Siyar</em> which he started writing in 1521
starts with the birth of the Prophet and comes down to AD 1534-35.</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030)</strong></p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“He several times waged war against the infidels of Hindustãn, and he
brought under his subjection a large portion of their country, until,
having made himself master of Somnãt, he destroyed all idol temples of
that country…^(<a href="#117">117</a>)</p>
<p>“…Sultãn Mahmûd, having entered into the idol temple, beheld an
excessively long and broad room, in so much that fifty-six pillars had
been made to support the roof. Somnãt was an idol cut out of
stone, whose height was five yards, of which three yards were visible,
and two yards were concealed in the ground. Yamînu-d daula having broken
that idol with his own hand, ordered that they should pack up pieces of
the stone, take them to Ghaznîn, and throw them on the threshold of the

to write a description of them is not easy… In short, the Sultãn Mahmûd
having possessed himself of the booty, burned their idol temples and
proceeded towards Kanauj.”^(<a href="#119">119</a>)</p>
<p><em>Kanauj (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“…The Ghaznivids found in these forts and their dependencies 10,000 idol
temples, and they ascertained the vicious belief of the Hindus to be,
that since the erection of these buildings no less than three or four
hundred thousand years had elapsed. Sultãn Mahmûd during this expedition
achieved many other conquests after he left Kanauj, and sent to hell
many of the infidels with blows of the well tempered sword. Such a

<strong>Bãbur-Nãma</strong></p>
<p>It is an autobiography written in the form of a diary by Zahîru’d-Dîn
Muhammad Bãbur, founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, who proclaimed
himself a Pãdshãh after his victory in the First Battle of Panipat (AD
1526), and a Ghãzî (killer of <em>kãfirs</em>) after the defeat of RãNã Sãñgã
in the Battle of Khanwa (AD 1528). While presenting himself as an
indefatigable warrior and drug-addict he does not hide the cruelties he
committed on the defeated people, particularly his fondness for building
towers of the heads of those he captured as prisoners of war or killed
in battle. He is very liberal in citing appropriate verses from
the Qur’ãn on the eve of his battle with RãNã Sãñgã. In order to ensure
his victory, he makes a covenant with Allãh by breaking the vessels
containing wine as also the cups for drinking it, swearing at the same
time that “he would break the idols of the idol-worshippers in a similar
manner.”^(<a href="#121">121</a>) In the <em>Fath-Nãma</em> (prayer for victory) composed
for him by Shykh Zain, Allah is described as “destroyer of idols from
their foundations.”^(<a href="#122">122</a>) The language he uses for his Hindu
adversaries is typically Islamic.</p>

<strong>Siyaru’l-‘Ãrifîn</strong></p>
<p>The author, Hamîd bin Fazlullãh is also known as Dervish Jamãlî Kamboh
Dihlawî. He was a Sufi of the Suhrawardiyya sect who died in AD 1536
while accompanying the Mughal Emperor Humãyun in the latter’s expedition
to Gujarat. His son, Shykh Gadãî was with the Mughal army in the Second
Battle of Panipat (AD 1556) and advised Akbar to kill the Hindu king,
Hîmû, with his own hand. On Akbar’s refusal, according to Badãunî, Shykh
Gadãî helped Bairam Khãn in doing the same deed. <em>Siyaru’l-‘Ãrifîn</em>,
completed between AD 1530 and 1536, is an account of the Chishtî and
Suhrawardî Sufis of the period.</p>
<p><em>Shykh Jalãlu’d-Dîn Tabrizî (AH 533-623)</em></p>
<p>He was the second most outstanding disciple of Shykh Shihabu’d-Dîn
Suhrawardî (AD 1145-1235), founder of the Suhrawardiyya silsilã of
Sufism. Having lived in Multan, Delhi and Badaun, he finally settled
down in Lakhanauti, also known as Gaur, in Bengal.</p>
<p><em>Devatala (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“Shaikh Jalalu’d-Dîn had many disciples in Bengal. He first lived at
Lakhnauti, constructed a <em>khanqah</em> and attached a langar to it. He also
bought some gardens and land to be attached to the monastery. He moved
to Devatalla (Deva Mahal) near Pandua in northern Bengal. There a
<em>kafir</em> (either a Hindu or a Buddhist) had erected a large temple and a
well. The Shaikh demolished the temple and constructed a <em>takiya</em>
(<em>khanqah</em>) and converted a large number of <em>kafirs</em>… Devatalla came to
be known as Tabrizabad and attracted a large number of
pilgrims.”^(<a href="#125">125</a>)</p>

India when the Mongols sacked their homeland.</p>
<p><em>Delhi</em></p>
<p>“The most prominent Indian Haidari was Shaikh Abu Bakr Tusi Haidari, who
settled in Delhi in the mid-thirteenth century. There he demolished a
temple on a site on the banks of the Jamna where he built a <em>khanqah</em>
and organized <em>sama</em> gathering. Shaikh Nizamu’d-Din Auliya’ was a
frequent visitor of Abu Bakr as was Shaikh Jamalu’d-Din of Hansi when he
was in Delhi. The latter gave Shaikh Abu Bakr the title Baz-i Safid
(White Falcon) symbolizing his rare mystical
achievements.”^(<a href="#126">126</a>)</p>

It is also known as <em>Tãrîkh-i-Afãghana</em> and
<em>Tãrîkh-i-Salãtin-I-Afãghana</em>. It deals with the history of the Lodîs
down to AD 1554. He completed it in AH 1001-02 (AD 1592-93). He calls
the Hindu kings “rascally infidels”, “black-faced foes”, “evil-doers”,
“dark-faced men”, etc. He extols the plunder and depopulation of entire
regions by Bahlûl Lodî (AD 1451-1489). He reports how Bãbur presented to
his sons, Humãyûn and Kãmrãn, two daughters of the Raja of Chanderi.</p>

<p><em>Nagarkot Kangra (Himachal Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“Sultãn Sikandar led a very pious life… Islãm was regarded very highly
in his reign. The infidels could not muster the courage to worship idols
or bathe in the (sacred) streams. During his holy reign, idols were
hidden underground. The stone (idol) of Nagarkot, which had misled the
(whole) world, was brought and handed over to butchers so that they
might weigh meat with it.”^(<a href="#128">128</a>)</p>

with the Sultãns for years, went to hell. His son, Bikarmãjît, became
his successor. The Sultãn captured the fort after a hard fight. There
was a quadruped, made of copper, at the door of the fort. It used to
speak. It was brought from there and placed in the fort at Agra. It

worshipped, together with a copper umbrella, which was placed over it,
and on which a date was engraved in Hindu characters, representing it to
be two thousand years old. When the stone was sent to the King, it was
given over to the butchers to make weights out of it for the purpose of
weighing their meat. From the copper of the umbrella, several pots were

king that Tahnesur was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as
Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the
principal of which they called Jugsom, pretending that it had existed
ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required,
according to the subsisting treaty with Anundpal, that his army should
not be molested on its march through his country…”^(<a href="#210">210</a>)</p>
<p>“The Raja’s brother, with two thousand horse was also sent to meet the
army, and to deliver the following message:- ‘My brother is the subject
and tributary of the King, but he begs permission to acquaint his
Majesty, that Tahnesur is the principal place of worship of the
inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of
Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted
himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But
if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Tahnesur,
Anundpal promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall
be annually paid to Mahmood; that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse
him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part he
will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable
amount.’ Mahmood replied, ‘The religion of the faithful inculcates the
following tenet: That in proportion as the tenets of the prophet are
diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of
idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven; that, therefore, it
behoved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the worship of
idols from the face of all India. How then should he spare Tahnesur?’</p>
<p>“This answer was communicated to the Raja of Dehly, who, resolving to
oppose the invaders, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint
the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a
vast army to destroy Tahnesur, now under his immediate protection. He
observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this
roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed,
and that it behoved them to unite their forces at Tahnesur, to avert the
impending calamity.</p>
<p>“Mahmood having reached Tahnesur before the Hindoos had time to take
measures for its defence, the city was plundered, the idols broken, and
the idol Jugsom was sent to Ghizny to be trodden under
foot…”^(<a href="#211">211</a>)</p>
<p><em>Mathura (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“Mahmood having refreshed his troops, and understanding that at some
distance stood the rich city of Mutra, consecrated to Krishn-Vasdew,
whom the Hindoos venerate as an emanation of God, directed his march
thither and entering it with little opposition from the troops of the
Raja of Delhy, to whom it belonged, gave it up to plunder. He broke down
or burned all the idols, and amassed a vast quantity of gold and silver,
of which the idols were mostly composed. He would have destroyed the
temples also, but he found the labour would have been excessive; while
some say that he was averted from his purpose by their admirable beauty.
He certainly extravagantly extolled the magnificence of the buildings
and city in a letter to the governor of Ghizny, in which the following
passage occurs: ‘There are here a thousand edifices as firm as the faith
of the faithful; most of them of marble, besides innumerable temples;
nor is it likely that this city has attained its present condition but
at the expense of many millions of deenars, nor could such another be
constructed under a period of two centuries.’^(<a href="#212">212</a>)</p>
<p>“The King tarried in Mutra 20 days; in which time the city suffered
greatly from fire, beside the damage it sustained by being pillaged. At
length he continued his march along the course of a stream on whose
banks were seven strong fortifications, all of which fell in succession:
there were also discovered some very ancient temples, which, according
to the Hindoos, had existed for 4000 years. Having sacked these temples
and forts, the troops were led against the fort of Munj…^(<a href="#213">213</a>)</p>
<p>“The King, on his return, ordered a magnificent mosque to be built of
marble and granite, of such beauty as struck every beholder with
astonishment, and furnished it with rich carpets, and with candelabras
and other ornaments of silver and gold. This mosque was universally
known by the name of the Celestial Bride. In its neighbourhood the King
founded an university, supplied with a vast collection of curious books
in various languages. It contained also a museum of natural curiosities.
For the maintenance of this establishment he appropriated a large sum of
money, besides a sufficient fund for the maintenance of the students,
and proper persons to instruct youth in the arts and
sciences…^(<a href="#214">214</a>)</p>

Kãlinjar attacked Qanauj because Rãjã Kuwar (of Qanauj) had surrendered
to Sultãn Mahmûd. As a result of this attack Rãjã Kuwar was killed. When

Musalmãns reached the Jumnã, the son of Rãjã Ãnand Pãl… stood in the way
of Mahmûd. The river of Jumnã was in spate at this time… and it became
very difficult for the army to get across… But as chance would have it,
eight royal guards of Mahmûd showed courage and crossed the river… they
attacked the army of the Hindûs and dispersed it… the son of Ãnand Pãl
ran away with his chiefs. All the eight royal guards… entered a city

tracts, denominated Kuriat and Nardein, continued the worship of idols
and had not embraced the faith of Islam… Mahmood resolved to carry the
war against these infidels, and accordingly marched towards their
country… The Ghiznevide general, Ameer Ally, the son of Arslan Jazib,
was now sent with a division of the army to reduce Nardein, which he
accomplished, pillaging the country, and carrying away many of the
people captives. In Nardein was a temple, which Ameer Ally destroyed,
bringing from thence a stone on which were curious inscriptions, and
which according to the Hindoos, must have been 40,000 years
old…”^(<a href="#217">217</a>)</p>

<p>“The celebrated temple of Somnat, situated in the province of Guzerat,
near the island of Dew, was in those times said to abound in riches, and
was greatly frequented by devotees from all parts of Hindoostan… Mahmood
marched from Ghizny in the month of Shaban AH 415 (AD Sept. 1024), with
his army, accompanied by 30,000 of the youths of Toorkistan and the
neighbouring countries, who followed him without pay, for the purpose of
attacking this temple…^(<a href="#218">218</a>)</p>
<p>“Some historians affirm that the idol was brought from Mecca, where it
stood before the time of the Prophet, but the Brahmins deny it, and say
that it stood near the harbour of Dew since the time of Krishn, who was
concealed in that place about 4000 years ago… Mahmood, taking the same
precautions as before, by rapid marches reached Somnat without
opposition. Here he saw a fortification on a narrow peninsula, washed on
three sides by the sea, on the battlements of which appeared a vast host
of people in arms… In the morning the Mahomedan troops advancing to the
walls, began the assault…”^(<a href="#219">219</a>)</p>
<p>“The battle raged with great fury: victory was long doubtful, till two
Indian princes, Brahman Dew and Dabishleem, with other reinforcements,
joined their countrymen during the action, and inspired them with fresh
courage. Mahmood at this moment perceiving his troops to waver, leaped
from his horse, and, prostrating himself before God implored his
assistance… At the same time he cheered his troops with such energy,
that, ashamed to abandon their king, with whom they had so often fought
and bled, they, with one accord, gave a loud shout and rushed forwards.
In this charge the Moslems broke through the enemy’s line, and laid
5,000^(<a href="#220">220</a>) Hindus dead at their feet… On approaching the
temple, he saw a superb edifice built of hewn stone. Its lofty roof was
supported by fifty-six pillars curiously carved and set with precious
stones. In the centre of the hall was Somnat, a stone idol five yards in
height, two of which were sunk in the ground. The King, approaching the
image, raised his mace and struck off its nose. He ordered two pieces of
the idol to be broken off and sent to Ghizny, that one might be thrown
at the threshold of the public mosque, and the other at the court door
of his own palace. These identical fragments are to this day (now 600
years ago) to be seen at Ghizny. Two more fragments were reserved to be
sent to Mecca and Medina. It is a well authenticated fact, that when
Mahmood was thus employed in destroying this idol, a crowd of Brahmins
petitioned his attendants and offered a quantity of gold if the King
would desist from further mutilation. His officers endeavoured to
persuade him to accept of the money; for they said that breaking one
idol would not do away with idolatry altogether; that, therefore, it
could serve no purpose to destroy the image entirely; but that such a
sum of money given in charity among true believers would be a
meritorious act. The King acknowledged that there might be reason in
what they said, but replied, that if he should consent to such a
measure, his name would be handed down to posterity as ‘Mahmood the
idol-seller’, whereas he was desirous of being known as ‘Mahmood the
destroyer’: he therefore directed the troops to proceed in their
work…^(<a href="#221">221</a>)</p>

Religion’; and to his second son, the Ameer Yoosoof, the appellation of
‘The Strength of the Arm of Fortune, and Establisher of Empires.’ He at

<p><em>Kashmir</em></p>
<p>“In these days he promoted a bramin, by name Seeva Dew Bhut, to the
office of prime minister, who embracing the Mahomedan faith, became such
a persecutor of Hindoos that he induced Sikundur to issue orders
proscribing the residence of any other than Mahomedans in Kashmeer; and
he required that no man should wear the mark on his forehead, or any
woman be permitted to burn with her husband’s corpse. Lastly, he
insisted on all golden and silver images being broken and melted down,
and the metal coined into money. Many of the bramins, rather than
abandon their religion or their country, poisoned themselves; some
emigrated from their native homes, while a few escaped the evil of
banishment by becoming Mahomedans. After the emigration of the bramins,
Sikundur ordered all the temples in Kashmeer to be thrown down; among
which was one dedicated to Maha Dew, in the district of Punjhuzara,
which they were unable to destroy, in consequence of its foundation
being below the surface of the neighbouring water. But the temple
dedicated to Jug Dew was levelled with the ground; and on digging into
its foundation the earth emitted volumes of fire and smoke which the
infidels declared to be the emblem of the wrath of the Deity; but
Sikundur, who witnessed the phenomenon, did not desist till the building
was entirely razed to the ground, and its foundations dug up.</p>
<p>“In another place in Kashmeer was a temple built by Raja Bulnat, the
destruction of which was attended with a remarkable incident. After it
had been levelled, and the people were employed in digging the
foundation, a copper-plate was discovered, on which was the following
inscription:- ‘Raja Bulnat, having built this temple, was desirous of
ascertaining from his astrologers how long it would last, and was
informed by them, that after eleven hundred years, a king named Sikundur
would destroy it, as well as the other temples in Kashmeer’…Having
broken all the images in Kashmeer, he acquired the title of the
Iconoclast, ‘Destroyer of Idols’…”^(<a href="#271">271</a>)</p>

officers who had lately made their escape, his ministers. About this
time one Meer Shumsood-Deen, disciple of Shah Kasim Anwur, the son of
Syud Mahomed Noorbukhsh arrived in Kashmeer from Irak. Futteh Khan made
over to this holy personage all the confiscated lands which had lately
fallen to the crown; and his disciples went forth destroying the temples
of the idolaters, in which they met with the support of the government,
so that no one dared to oppose them. In a short time many of the
Kashmeeries, particularly those of the tribe of Chuk, became converts to
the Noorbukhsh tenets. The persuasion of this sect was connected with
that of the Sheeas; but many proselytes, who had not tasted of the cup
of grace, after the death of Meer Shumsood-Deen, reverted to their
idols…”^(<a href="#272">272</a>)</p>

<p><em>Ajmer (Rajasthan)</em></p>
<p>“…On the 7th Ãzar I went to see and shoot on the tank of Pushkar, which
is one of the established praying-places of the Hindus, with regard to
the perfection of which they give (excellent) accounts that are
incredible to any intelligence, and which is situated at a distance of
three kos from Ajmir. For two or three days I shot waterfowl on that
tank, and returned to Ajmir. Old and new temples which, in the language
of the infidels, they call Deohara are to be seen around this tank.
Among them Rãnã Shankar, who is the uncle of the rebel Amar, and in my
kingdom is among the high nobles, had built a Deohara of great
magnificence, on which 100,000 rupees had been spent. I went to see that
temple. I found a form cut out of black stone, which from the neck above
was in the shape of a pig’s head, and the rest of the body was like that
of a man. The worthless religion of the Hindus is this, that once on a
time for some particular object the Supreme Ruler thought it necessary
to show himself in this shape; on this account they hold it dear and
worship it. I ordered them to break that hideous form and throw it into
the tank. After looking at this building there appeared a white dome on
the top of a hill, to which men were coming from all quarters. When I
asked about this they said that a Jogî lived there, and when the
simpletons come to see him he places in their hands a handful of
flour, which they put into their mouths and imitate the cry of an animal
which these fools have at some time injured, in order that by this act
their sins may be blotted out. I ordered them to break down that place
and turn the Jogî out of it, as well as to destroy the form of an idol
there was in the dome…”^(<a href="#273">273</a>)</p>

gave an order that the Qãzî, the Chief Justice (<em>Mir‘Adl</em>), and other
learned men of Islam should accompany me and carry out in the fort
whatever was customary, according to the religion of Muhammad. Briefly,
having traversed about one koss, I went up to the top of the fort, and
by the grace of God, the call to prayer and the reading of the Khutba
and the slaughter of a bullock which had not taken place from the
commencement of the building of the fort till now, were carried out in
my presence. I prostrated myself in thanksgiving for this great gift,
which no king had hoped to receive, and ordered a lofty mosque to be
built inside the fort…</p>
<p>“After going round the fort I went to see the temple of Durgã, which is
known as Bhawan. A world has here wandered in the desert of error.
Setting aside the infidels whose custom is the worship of idols, crowds
of the people of Islam, traversing long distances, bring their offerings
and pray to the black stone (image)… Some maintain that this stone,
which is now a place of worship for the vile infidels, is not the stone
which was there originally, but that a body of the people of Islam came
and carried off the original stone, and threw it into the bottom of the
river, with the intent that no one could get at it. For a long time the
tumult of the infidels and idol-worshippers had died away in the world,
till a lying brahman hid a stone for his own ends, and going to the Raja
of the time said: ‘I saw Durgã in a dream, and she said to me: They have
thrown me into a certain place: quickly go and take me up.’ The Raja, in
the simplicity of his heart, and greedy for the offerings of gold that
would come to him, accepted the tale of the brahman and sent a number of
people with him, and brought that stone, and kept it in this place with
honour, and started again the shop of error and
misleading…”^(<a href="#274">274</a>)</p>
<p><em>Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“I am here led to relate that at the city of Banaras a temple had been
erected by Rajah Maun Singh, which cost him the sum of nearly thirty-six
laks of five methkally ashrefies. The principle idol in this temple had
on its head a tiara or cap, enriched with jewels to the amount of three
laks ashrefies. He had placed in this temple moreover, as the associates
and ministering servants of the principal idol, four other images of
solid gold, each crowned with a tiara, in the like manner enriched with
precious stones. It was the belief of these Jehennemites that a dead
Hindu, provided when alive he had been a worshipper, when laid before
this idol would be restored to life. As I could not possibly give credit
to such a pretence, I employed a confidential person to ascertain the
truth; and, as I justly supposed, the whole was detected to be an
impudent imposture. Of this discovery I availed myself, and I made it my
plea for throwing down the temple which was the scene of this imposture
and on the spot, with the very same materials, I erected the great
mosque, because the very name of Islam was proscribed at Banaras, and
with God’s blessing it is my design, if I live, to fill it full with
true believers.”^(<a href="#275">275</a>)</p>

<strong>Mir‘ãt-i-Mas‘ûdî</strong></p>
<p>It is a biography of Sayyid Sãlãr Mas‘ûd Ghãzî whose tomb at Bahraich
(Uttar Pradesh) occupies the site of a Sun Temple. It was written by
Shykh ‘Abdu’r-Rahmãn Chishtî in the reign of Jahangir (1605-1628). He
drew his main material from <em>Tawãrîkh-i-Mahmûdî</em> by Mullã Muhammad
Ghaznavî, a contemporary of Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (AD 997-1030). Sãlãr
Mas‘ûd, according to this account, was the son of Sitr Mu’alla’, a
sister of Sultãn Mahmûd, married to his general, Sãlãr Sãhû. Sãlãr
Mas‘ûd was born when the couple was staying in Ajmer. He is famous among
the Muslims as <em>Ghãzî Miyãn, Bãlã Miyãn</em> (revered boy) and <em>Hathîlã</em> Pîr
(the obstinate saint). There are many stories current regarding how he
led or sent many expeditions against the Hindu <em>Kãfîrs</em> in all direction
from his headquarters at Satrakh in the Barabanki District of Uttar
Pradesh. He is supposed to have defeated many <em>Rãjãs</em>, plundered many
towns, and destroyed many temples, particularly in Awadh. Many tombs all
over Awadh and neighbouring areas are reputed to be the graves of his
<em>Ghãzîs</em> (veterans) who became <em>Shahîds</em> (martys) in a prolonged <em>Jihãd</em>
(holy war) directed by him. He was finally caught and killed near
Bahraich by a league of Hindu <em>Rãjãs</em>. The Sun Temple which was his
target escaped this time, but was destroyed when another wave of Islamic
invasion swept over the area at the end of the twelfth century.</p>
<p><strong>Saiyyid Sãlãr Mas‘ûd Ghãzî (AD 1013-1033)</strong></p>
<p><em>Somnath (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“It happened that Mahmûd had long been planning an expedition into
Bhardana, and Gujarat, to destroy the idol temple of Somnãt, a place of
great sanctity to all Hindus. So as soon as he had returned to Ghaznî
from his Khurasan business, he issued a <em>farmãn</em> to the General of the
army, ordering him to leave a confidential officer in charge of the fort
of Kabuliz, and himself to join the court with his son Sãlãr
Mas‘ud…^(<a href="#298">298</a>)</p>
<p>“It is related in the <em>Tãrîkh-i Mahmûdî</em> that the Sultãn shortly after
reached Ghaznî, and laid down the image of Somnãt at the threshold of
the Mosque of Ghaznî, so that the Musulmãns might tread upon the breast
of the idol on their way to and from their devotions. As soon as the
unbelievers heard of this, they sent an embassy to Khwãja Hasan
Maimandî, stating that the idol was of stone and useless to the
Musulmãns, and offered to give twice its weight in gold as a ransom, if
it might be returned to them. Khwãja Hasan Maimandî represented to the
Sultãn that the unbelievers had offered twice the weight of the idol in
gold, and had agreed to be subject to him. He added, that the best
policy would be to take the gold and restore the image, thereby
attaching die people to his Government. The Sultãn yielded to the advice
of the Khwãja, and the unbelievers paid the gold into the treasury.</p>
<p>“One day, when the Sultãn was seated on his throne, the ambassadors of
the unbelievers came, and humbly petitioned thus: ‘Oh, Lord of the
world! we have paid the gold to your Government in ransom, but have not
yet received our purchase, the idol Somnãt.’ The Sultãn was wroth at
their words, and, falling into reflection, broke up the assembly and
retired, with his dear Sãlãr Mas‘ûd, into his private apartments. He
then asked his opinion as to whether the image ought to be restored, or
not?  Sãlãr Mas‘ûd, who was perfect in goodness, said quickly, ‘In the
day of the resurrection, when the Almighty shall call for Ãzar, the
idol-destroyer, and Mahmûd, the idol-seller, Sire! what will you say?’
This speech deeply affected the Sultãn, he was full of grief, and
answered, ‘I have given my word; it will be a breach of promise.’ Sãlãr
Mas‘ûd begged him to make over the idol to him, and tell the unbelievers
to get it from him. The Sultãn agreed; and Sãlãr Mas‘ûd took it to his
house, and, breaking off its nose and ears, ground them to powder.</p>
<p>“When Khwãja Hasan introduced the unbelievers, and asked the Sultãn to
give orders to restore the image to them, his majesty replied that Sãlãr
Mas‘ûd had carried it off to his house, and that he might send them to
get it from him. Khwãja Hasan, bowing his head, repeated these words in
Arabic, ‘No easy matter is it to recover anything which has fallen into
the hands of a lion.’ He then told the unbelievers that the idol was
with Sãlãr Mas‘ûd, and that they were at liberty to go and fetch it. So
they went to Mas‘ûd’s door and demanded their god.</p>
<p>“That prince commanded Malik Nekbakht to treat them courteously, and
make them be seated; then to mix the dust of the nose and ears of the
idol with sandal and the lime eaten with betel-nut, and present it to
them. The unbelievers were delighted, and smeared themselves with
sandal, and ate the betel-leaf. After a while they asked for the idol,
when Sãlãr Mas‘ûd said he had given it to them. They inquired, with
astonishment, what he meant by saying that they had received the
idol? And Malik Nekbakht explained that it was mixed with the sandal and
betel-lime. Some began to vomit, while others went weeping and lamenting
to Khwãja Hasan Maimandî and told him what had occurred…”^(<a href="#299">299</a>)</p>
<p>“Afterwards the image of Somnãt was divided into four parts, as is
described in the <em>Tawãrîkh-i-Mahmûdî</em>. Mahmûd’s first exploit is said to
have been conquering the Hindû rebels, destroying the forts and the idol
temples of the Rãî Ajipãl (Jaipãl), and subduing the country of India.
His second, the expedition into Harradawa and Guzerãt, the carrying off
the idol of Somnãt, and dividing it into four pieces, one of which he is
reported to have placed on the threshold of the Imperial Palace, while
he sent two others to Mecca and Medina respectively. Both these exploits
were performed at the suggestion, and by the advice, of the General and
Sãlãr Mas‘ûd; but India was conquered by the efforts of Sãlãr Mas‘ûd
alone, and the idol of Somnãt was broken in pieces by his sold advice,
as has been related. Sãlãr Sãhû was Sultãn of the army and General of
the forces in Iran…^(<a href="#300">300</a>)</p>
<p><em>Awadh (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“…Mas‘ûd hunted through the country around Bahraich, and whenever he
passed by the idol temple of Sûraj-kund, he was wont to say that he
wanted that piece of ground for a dwelling-place. This Sûraj-kund was a
sacred shrine of all the unbelievers of India. They had carved an image
of the sun in stone on the banks of the tank there. This image they
called Bãlãrukh, and through its fame Bahraich had attained its
flourishing condition. When there was an eclipse of the sun, the
unbelievers would come from east and west to worship it, and every
Sunday the heathen of Bahraich and its environs, male and female, used
to assemble in thousands to rub their heads under that stone, and do it
reverence as an object of peculiar sanctity. Mas‘ûd was distressed at
this idolatry, and often said that, with God’s will and assistance, he
would destroy that mine of unbelief, and set up a chamber for the
worship of the Nourisher of the Universe in its place, rooting out
unbelief from those parts…^(<a href="#301">301</a>)</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the Rãi Sahar Deo and Har Deo, with several other chiefs,
who had kept their troops in reserve, seeing that the army of Islãm was
reduced to nothing, unitedly attacked the body-guard of the Prince. The
few forces that remained to that loved one of the Lord of the Universe
were ranged round him in the garden. The unbelievers, surrounding them
in dense numbers, showered arrows upon them. It was then, on Sunday,
the 14th of the month Rajab, in the aforesaid year 424 (14th June, 1033)
as the time of evening prayer came on, that a chance arrow pierced the
main artery in the arm of the Prince of the Faithful…^(<a href="#302">302</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Shykh Mu‘în al-Dîn Chishtî of Ajmer (d. AD 1236)</strong></p>
<p><em>Ajmer (Rajasthan)</em></p>
<p>“Although at that time there were very many temples of idols around the
lake, when the Khwaja saw them, he said: ‘If God and His Prophet so
will, it will not be long before I raze to the ground these idol
temples.’</p>
<p>“It is said that among those temples there was one temple to reverence
which the Rãjã and all the infidels used to come, and lands had been
assigned to provide for its expenditure. When the Khwãja settled there,
every day his servants bought a cow, brought it there and slaughtered it
and ate it…</p>
<p>“So when the infidels grew weak and saw that they had no power to resist
such a perfect companion of God, they… went into their idol temples
which were their places of worship. In them there was a dev, in front of
whom they cried out and asked for help…^(<a href="#303">303</a>)</p>
<p>“…The dev who was their leader, when he saw the perfect beauty of the
Khwãja, trembled from head to foot like a willow tree. However much he
tried to say ‘Ram, Ram’, it was ‘Rahîm, Rahîm’ that came from his
tongue… The Khwãja… with his own hand gave a cup of water to a servant
to take to the dev… He had no sooner drunk it than his heart was
purified of darkness of unbelief, he ran forward and fell at the
Heaven-treading feet of the Khwãja, and professed his belief…</p>
<p>“The Khwãja said: ‘I also bestow on you the name of Shãdî Dev [Joyful
Deval]’…^(<a href="#304">304</a>)</p>
<p>“…Then Shadî Dev… suggested to the Khwãja, that he should now set up a
place in the city, where the populace might benefit from his holy
arrival. The Khwãja accepted this suggestion, and ordered one of his
special servants called Muhammad Yãdgîr to go into the city and set in
good order a place for faqîrs. Muhammad Yãdgîr carried out his orders,
and when he had gone into the city, he liked well the place where the
radiant tomb of the Khwãja now is, and which originally belonged to
Shãdî Dev, and he suggested that the Khwãja should favour it with his
residence…^(<a href="#305">305</a>)</p>
<p>“…Mu‘în al-dîn had a second wife for the following reason: one night he
saw the Holy Prophet in the flesh. The prophet said: ‘You are not truly
of my religion if you depart in any way from my sunnat.’ It happened
that the ruler of the Patli fort, Malik Khitãb, attacked the unbelievers
that night and captured the daughter of the Rãjã of that land. He
presented her to Mu‘în al-dîn who accepted her and named her Bîbî
Umiya.”^(<a href="#306">306</a>)</p>
<p>P.M. Currie comments:</p>
<p>“…The take-over of ‘pagan’ sites is a recurrent feature of the history
of the expansion of Islam. The most obvious precedent is to be found in
the Muslim annexation of the Hajar al-aswad at Mecca… Sir Thomas Arnol
remarks that ‘in many instances there is no doubt that the shrine of a
Muslim saint marks the site of some local cult which was practised on
the spot long before the introduction of Islam.’</p>
<p>“There is evidence, more reliable than the tradition recorded in the
Siyar al-Aqtãb, to suggest that this was the case in Ajmer. Sculpted
stones, apparently from a Hindu temple, are incorporated in the Buland
Darwãza of Mu‘în al-dîn’s shrine. Moreover, his tomb is built over a
series of cellars which may have formed part of an earlier temple… A
tradition, first recorded in the ‘Anis al-Arwãh, suggests that the
Sandal Khãna is built on the site of Shãdî Dev’s
temple.”^(<a href="#307">307</a>)</p>

<p><em>Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The infidels demolished a mosque that was under construction and
wounded the artisans. When the news reached Shãh Yasîn, he came to
Banaras from Mandyawa and collecting the Muslim weavers, demolished the
big temple. A Sayyid who was an artisan by profession agreed with one
Abdul Rasûl to build a mosque at Banaras and accordingly the foundation
was laid. Near the place there was a temple and many houses belonging to
it were in the occupation of the Rajputs. The infidels decided that the
construction of a mosque in the locality was not proper and that it
should be razed to the ground. At night the walls of the mosque were
found demolished. Next day the wall was rebuilt but it was again
destroyed. This happened three or four times. At last the Sayyid hid
himself in a corner. With the advent of night the infidels came to
achieve their nefarious purpose. When Abdul Rasûl gave the alarm, the
infidels began to fight and the Sayyid was wounded by Rajputs. In the
meantime, the Musalman resident of the neighbourhood arrived at the spot
and the infidels took to their heels. The wounded Muslims were taken to
Shãh Yasîn who determined to vindicate the cause of Islam. When he came
to the mosque, people collected from the neighbourhood. The civil
officers were outwardly inclined to side with the saint, but in reality
they were afraid of the royal displeasure on account of the Raja, who
was a courtier of the Emperor and had built the temple (near which the
mosque was under construction). Shãh Yasîn, however, took up the sword
and started for Jihad. The civil officers sent him a message that such a
grave step should not be taken without the Emperor’s permission. Shãh
Yasîn, paying no heed, sallied forth till he reached Bazar Chau Khamba
through a fusillade of stones… The, doors (of temples) were forced open
and the idols thrown down. The weavers and other Musalmans demolished
about 500 temples. They desired to destroy the temple of Beni Madho, but
as lanes were barricaded, they desisted from going
further.”^(<a href="#346">346</a>)</p>

numerous idols, adorned and embellished with precious jewels and
valuable pearls. It was the custom of the infidels to resort to this
temple from far and near several times in each year to worship the
idols, and a certain fee to the Government was fixed upon each man, for
which he obtained admittance. As there was a large congress of pilgrims,
a very considerable amount was realized from them, and paid into the
royal treasury. This practice had been observed to the end of the reign
of the Emperor Shãh Jahãn, and in the commencement of Aurangzeb’s
government; but when the latter was informed of it, he was exceedingly
angry and abolished the custom. The greatest nobles of his court
represented to him that a large sum was realized and paid into the
public treasury, and that if it was abolished, a great reduction in the
income of the state would take place. The Emperor observed, ‘What you
say is right, but I have considered well on the subject, and have
reflected on it deeply; but if you wish to augment the revenue, there is
a better plan for attaining the object by exacting the <em>jizya</em>. By this
means idolatry will be suppressed, the Muhammadan religion and the true
faith will be honoured, our proper duty will be performed, the finances
of the state will be increased, and the infidels will be disgraced.’
…This was highly approved by all the nobles; and the Emperor ordered all

destroyed…”^(<a href="#353">353</a>)</p>

Masjidi Ala, the erection of which had been suspended since the year
1198 Hijri, and the Daroghu Public buildings, according to the plan,
which will be mentioned hereafter, completed it in two years, at the
expense of three lakhs of rupees…</p>
<p>“…It is known that when the vile and rejected Brahman Khunda Rao
imprisoned the Nawab’s Zanana and the Sultan (who was then a boy of six
or seven years of age) in a house in the fort… there stood a Hindu
temple, the area or space round which was large. The Sultan, therefore,
in his infancy being like all children fond of play, and as in that
space boys of Kinhiri Brahmin castes assembled to amuse themselves, was
accustomed to quit the house to see them play, or play with them… It
happened one day that a Fakir (a religious mendicant) a man of
saint-like mind passed that way, and seeing the Sultan gave him a life
bestowing benediction, saying to him, ‘Fortunate child, at a future time
thou will be the king of this country, and whey thy time comes, remember
my words-take this temple and destroy it, and build a Masjid in its
place, and for ages it will remain a memorial of thee.’ The Sultan
smiled, and in reply told him, ‘that whenever, by his blessing, he
should become a Padishah, or king, he would do as he (the Fakir)
directed.’ When, therefore, after a short time his father became a
prince, the possessor of wealth and territory, he remembered his
promise, and after his return from Nagar and Gorial Bundar, he purchased
the temple from the adorers of the image in it (which after all was
nothing but the figure of a bull, made of brick and mortar) with their
goodwill, and the Brahmins, therefore, taking away their image, placed
it in the Deorhi Peenth, and the temple was pulled down, and the
foundations of a new Masjid raised on the site, agreeably to a plan of
the Mosque built by Ali Adil Shah, at Bijapur, and brought
thence.”^(<a href="#376">376</a>)</p>
<p>The nature of the purchase needs no comment:</p>

<p>“Muhammad Bakhtiyar sweeping the town with the broom of devastation,
completely demolished it, and making anew the city of Lakhnauti… his

forces, and brought to his subjection the entire dominion of Odîsah
(Orissa), so much so that he carried off the Rani together with all
household goods and chattels. Notwithstanding all this, from fear of
being killed, no one was bold to wake up this drunkard of the sleep of
negligence, so that Kãlãpahãr had his hands free. After completing the
subjugation of the entire country, and investing the Fort of BãrahbãTi,
which was his (the Rajah’s) place of sleep, Kãlãpahãr engaged in
fighting… The firm Muhammadan religion and the enlightened laws of Islãm
were introduced into that country. Before this, the Musalman Sovereigns
exercised no authority over this country. Of the miracles of Kãlãpahãr,
one was this, that wherever in that country, the sound of his drum
reached, the hands and the feet, the ears and the noses of the idols,
worshipped by the Hindus, fell off their stone-figures, so that even now
stone-idols, with hands and feet broken, and noses and ears cut off, are
lying at several places in that country. And the Hindus pursuing the
false, from blindness of their hearts, with full sense and knowledge,
devote themselves to their worship!</p>

<strong>Bahãr-i‘Ãzam</strong></p>
<p>It is an account of a journey undertaken in 1823 by ‘Ãzam Jãh Bahãdur
“after he ascended the throne of the Carnatic as Nawwãb Wãlãjãh
VI.”^(<a href="#379">379</a>) The author, Ghulãm ‘Abdul Qadir Nãzir, was his court
scribe who accompanied the Nawwãb on this journey. Nãzir does not tell
us that his patron was a Nawwãb only in name as he was living in Madras
on British charity, his ancestral principality of Arcot having been
ceded to the British in 1801. What he says instead is how the “Nawwãb”
lost his temper when he learnt that the Muslims in his retinue were
visiting the Hindu temples at Chidambaram and how he “gave strict
orders” to British officers of the place “that no Muslim should be
allowed to go over to the temple and enter it.”^(<a href="#380">380</a>) At a later
stage, we are told that “the party marched forth… to the accompaniment
of music provided by dancing girls of the Hindu
cornmunity.”^(<a href="#381">381</a>) The account names numerous Sufis etc., who
came to the districts of Chingleput, North Arcot, South Arcot,
Tiruchirapalli and Thanjavur and established Muslim places of worship.
What these new monuments replaced becomes obvious from the following few
instances.</p>
<p><strong>Sufi Nãtthar Walî</strong></p>
<p><em>Tiruchirapalli (Tamil Nadu)</em></p>
<p>“It is said that in ancient days Trichila, an execrable monster with
three heads, who was a brother of Rawan, with ten heads, had the sway
over this country. No human being could oppose him. But as per the
saying of the Prophet, ‘Islam will be elevated and cannot be subdued’,
the Faith took root by the efforts of Hazarat Natthar Wali. The monster
was slain and sent to the house of perdition. His image namely but-ling
worshipped by the unbelievers was cut and the head was separated from
the body. A portion of the body went into the ground. Over that spot is
the tomb of the Wali, shedding rediance till this day.”^(<a href="#382">382</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sufi Shãh Bheka</strong></p>
<p>“Shah Bheka… when he was at Trichinopoly during the days of Rani
Minachi, the unbelievers who did not like his stay there harassed him.
One day when he was very much vexed, he got upon the bull in front of
the temple, which the Hindus worship calling it <em>swami</em>, and made it
move on by the power and strength of the Supreme Life Giver… They
abandoned the temple and gave the entire place on the <em>aruskalwa</em> as
present to the Shah.”^(<a href="#383">383</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sufi Qãyim Shãh</strong></p>
<p>“Qayim Shah… came here from Hindustan. He was the cause for the
destruction of twelve temples. He lived to an old age and passed away on
the 17th Safar AH 1193.”^(<a href="#384">384</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sufi Nûr Muhammad Qãdirî</strong></p>
<p><em>Vellore (Tamil Nadu)</em></p>
<p>“Hazarat Nur Muhammad Qadiri was the most unique man regarded as an
invaluable person of his age. Very often he was the cause of the ruin of
temples. Some of these were laid waste. He selected his own burial
ground in the vicinity of the temple. Although he lived five hundred
years ago, people at large still remember his
greatness.”^(<a href="#385">385</a>)</p>

<strong>Ãsãru’s-Sanãdîd</strong></p>
<p>It is a book on the antiquities of Delhi written by Sayyid Ahmad Khãn,
the famous founder of the Aligarh Muslim University. Its first edition
was published in 1847, the second in 1854, and the third in 1904. A new
edition with a long introduction, footnotes, comments, bibliography, and
index has been published recently. We are reproducing relevant passages
from this edition.</p>
<p><em>Qutbu’d-Dîn Aibak (AD 1192-1210)</em></p>
<p><em>Iron Pillar</em>: “…In our opinion this pillar was made in the ninth
century before (the birth of) Lord Jesus… When Rãi Pithorã built a fort
and an idol-house near this pillar, it stood in the courtyard of the
idol-house. And when Qutbu’d-Dîn Aibak constructed a mosque after
demolishing the idol-house, this pillar stood in the courtyard of the
mosque…”^(<a href="#386">386</a>)</p>
<p><em>Idol-house of Rãi Pithorã</em>: “There was an idol-house near the fort of
Rãi Pithorã. It was very famous… It was built along with the fort in
1200 Bikarmî [Vikrama SaMvat] corresponding to AD 1143 and AH 538. The
building of this temple was very unusual, and the work done on it by
stone-cutters is such that nothing better can be conceived. The
beautiful carvings on every stone in it defy description… The eastern
and northern portions of this idol-house have survived intact. The fact
that the Iron Pillar, which belongs to the Vaishnava faith, was kept
inside it, as also the fact that sculptures of Kirshan avatãr and
Mahãdev and Ganesh and Hanumãn were carved on its walls, leads us to
believe that this temple belonged to the Vaishnava faith. Although all
sculptures were mutilated in the times of Muslims, even so a close
scrutiny can identify as to which sculpture was what.  In our opinion
there was a red-stone building in this idol-house, and it was
demolished. For, this sort of old stones with sculptures carved on them
are still found.”^(<a href="#387">387</a>)</p>
<p><em>Quwwat al-Islãm Masjid</em>: “When Qutbu’d-Dîn, the commander-in-chief of
Muizzu’d-Dîn Sãm alias Shihãbu’d-Dîn Ghûrî, conquered Delhi in AH 587
corresponding to AD 1191 corresponding to 1248 Bikarmî, this idol-house
(of Rãi Pithorã) was converted into a mosque. The idol was taken out of
the temple.  Some of the images sculptured on walls or doors or pillars
were effaced completely, some were defaced. But the structure of the
idol-house kept standing as before. Materials from twenty-seven temples,
which were worth five crores and forty lakhs of Dilwãls, were used in
the mosque, and an inscription giving the date of conquest and his own
name was installed on the eastern gate…^(<a href="#388">388</a>)</p>
<p>“When Mãlwãh and Ujjain were conquered by Sultãn Shamsu’d-Dîn in AH 631
corresponding to AD 1233, then the idol-house of Mahãkãl was demolished
and its idols as well as the statue of Rãjã Bikramãjît were brought to
Delhi, they were strewn in front of the door of the
mosque…”^(<a href="#389">389</a>)</p>
<p>“In books of history, this mosque has been described as Masjid-i-Ãdînah
and Jãma‘ Masjid Delhi, but Masjid Quwwat al-Islãm is mentioned nowhere.
It is not known as to when this name was adopted. Obviously, it seems
that when this idol-house was captured, and the mosque constructed, it
was named Quwwat al-Islãm…”^(<a href="#390">390</a>)</p>
<p><em><strong>Sultãn Shamsu’d-Dîn Iltutmish (AD 1210-1236)</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Tomb of Sultãn Ghãrî</em>: Sayyid Ahmad Khãn notices this tomb and
describes it as exquisite. He says that it was built in AH 626
corresponding to AD 1228 when the corpse of Sultãn Nãsiru’d-Dîn Mahmûd,
the eldest son of Sultãn Shamsu’d-Dîn Iltutmish, who was Governor of
Laknauti and who died while his father was still alive, was brought to
Delhi and buried.^(<a href="#391">391</a>) But the editor, Khaleeq Anjum, comments
in his introduction that “the dome of the mosque which is of marble has
been re-used and has probably been obtained from some temple”, and that
the domes on the four pavilions outside “are in Hindu style in their
interior.”^(<a href="#392">392</a>) He provides greater details in his notes at the
end of Sayyid Ahmad’s work. He writes:</p>
<p>“…This is the first Muslim tomb in North India, if we overlook some
others. And it is the third historical Muslim monument in India after
Quwwat al-Islãm Masjid and ADhãî Din Kã JhoñpRã… Stones from Hindu
temples have been used in this tomb also, as in the Quwwat al-Islãm
Masjid.”^(<a href="#393">393</a>)</p>
<p>“…In the middle of the corridor on the west there is a marble dome. A
look at the dome leads to the conclusion that it has been brought from
some temple. The pillars that have been raised in the western corridor
are of marble and have been made in Greek style. It is clear that they
belong to some other building…”^(<a href="#394">394</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sultãn Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Tughlaq (AD 1320-1325)</strong></p>
<p><em>Tomb of Ghiyãsu’d-Dîn Tughlaq</em>: Similarly, Sayyid Ahmad notices this
tomb in some detail but does not describe its Hindu
features.^(<a href="#395">395</a>) Khaleeq Anjum, however, says in his introduction
that “corridors inside this tomb have been constructed in the style
of Hindu architecture, and the pillars as well as the beams in the
corridors are fully of Hindu fashion.”^(<a href="#396">396</a>) He repeats the same
comments in his notes at the end.”^(<a href="#397">397</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Nasîru’d-Dîn Muhammad Humãyûn Pãdshãh Ghãzî (AD 1530-1540 and 1556)</strong></p>
<p><em>Nîlî Chhatrî</em>: “At the foot of Salîm Garh and on the bank of the
Jamunã, there is a small Bãrãdarî near Nigambodh Ghãt… It is known as
Nîlî Chhatrî because of the blue mosaic work on its dome. This Chhatrî
was built by Humãyûn Bãdshãh in AH 939 corresponding to AD 1533 in order
to have a view of the river. Hindus ascribe this Chhatrî to the time of
the PãNDûs. Even if that is not true, this much is certain that the
bricks with mosaic work which have been used in this Chhatrî have been
taken from some Hindu place because the bricks bear broken and mutilated
images. On account of a derangement of the carvings, some have only the
head left, while some others show only the torso. This derangement of
carvings also goes to prove that these bricks have been placed here
after being taken out from somewhere else. According to the Hindus, Rãjã
Judhastar had performed a Jag [Yajña] at this Ghãt. It is not
inconceivable that in the Hindu era a Chhatrî had been built at some
spot on this Ghãt in commemoration of the Jag, and that this Chhatrî was
built in the reign of Humãyûn after demolition of that (older)
Chhatrî…^(<a href="#398">398</a>)</p>

Ghãt…^(<a href="#399">399</a>)</p>

<strong>Hadiqah-i-Shuhadã</strong></p>
<p>This was written in the reign of Nawãb Wãjid ‘Alî Shãh of Awadh (AD
1847-1856) by Mîrza ‘Alî Jãn, an eyewitness of and active participant in
the <em>jihãd</em> led by Amîr ‘Alî Amethawî in 1855 for recapturing the
Hanumãn GaRhî temple at Ayodhya. The temple had been converted into a
mosque in the reign of Aurangzeb but restored when Muslim power suffered
an eclipse. The work was written immediately after the failure of the
<em>jihãd</em> and published in 1856.</p>
<p><strong>Zahîru’d-Dîn Muhammad Bãbur Pãdshãh Ghãzî (AD 1026-1030)</strong></p>
<p><em>Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“Wherever they found magnificent temples of the Hindus ever since the
establishment of Sayyid Salar Mas’ud Ghazi’s rule, the Muslim rulers in
India built mosques, monasteries and inns, appointed mu’azzins,
teachers, and store-stewards, spread Islam vigorously and vanquished the
Kafirs. Likewise, they cleared up Faizabad and Avadh, too, from the
filth of reprobation (infidelity), because it was a great centre of
worship and capital of Rama’s father. Where there stood the great temple
(of Ramjanmasthan), there they built a big mosque, and where there was a
small <em>mandap</em> (pavilion), there they erected a camp mosque
(<em>masjid-i-mukhtasar-i-qanati</em>). The Janmasthan temple is the principal
place of Rama’s incarnation, adjacent to which is the <em>Sita ki
Rasoi</em>. Hence, what a lofty mosque was built there by king Babar in AH
923 (AD 1528) under the patronage of Musa Ashiqan! The mosque is still
known far and wide as the Sita ki Rasoi mosque. And that temple is
extant by its side (<em>aur pahlu mein wah dair baqi
hai</em>).”^(<a href="#400">400</a>)</p>

<p><em>Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“According to old records, it has been a rule with the Muslim rulers
from the first to build mosques, monasteries, and inns, spread Islam,
and put (a stop to) non-Islamic practices, wherever they found
prominence (of <em>kufr</em>). Accordingly, even as they cleared up Mathura,
Bindraban etc., from the rubbish of non-Islamic practices, the Babari
mosque was built up in AH 923 (?) under the patronage of Sayyid Musa
Ashiqan in the Janmasthan temple (<em>butkhane Janmsthan mein</em>) in Faizabad
Avadh, which was a great place of (worship) and capital of Rama’s
father…</p>
<p>“A great mosque was built on the spot where Sita ki Rasoi is situated.
During the regime of Babar, the Hindus had no guts to be a match for the
Muslims. The mosque was built in AH 923 (?) under the patronage of
Sayyid Mir Ashiqan… Aurangzeb built a mosque on the Hanuman Garhi… The
Bairagis effaced the mosque and erected a temple in its place. Then
idols began to be worshipped openly in the Babari mosque where the Sita
ki Rasoi is situated.”^(<a href="#401">401</a>)</p>

<strong>Mosque Architecture of Pre-Mughal Bengal</strong></p>
<p>This is a modern work published from Dacca (Bangladesh) in 1979. The
author, Dr. Syed Mahmudul Hasan, had submitted it as his Ph.D. thesis to
the University of London in 1965. He has been the Head of the

University College in Decca, a member of F.R.A.S. and F.S.A. (Scot), and
has served on the staff of the Department of Eastern Art in the

sources, literary and archaeological. It carries 43 plates with 45
photographs of monuments, and of inscriptions etc. discovered in them.
We have brought together, from different pages, the passages which
relate to the same subject.</p>
<p><em>General and Persistent Practice</em></p>
<p>“The Muslim invaders were necessarily impressed by Indian architecture
and sculpture, expressing as they do foreign religious emotions in terms
of images and emblems. What they saw at Delhi, and the other cities of
India, which they attacked, was absolutely foreign to them. Yet when
they came to raise their own religious buildings, they were not averse
to using the spoils of their temples…^(<a href="#403">403</a>)</p>
<p>“The ruthless desecration and makeshift conversion of Indian temples
into Mosques has led many scholars to regard Indo-Muslim architecture as
nothing more than a local variety of hybrid nature. In point of fact,
these early Indian mosques which were compiled from Brahamanical
fragments, such as the Deval Masjid at Bodhan near Hyderabad, have no
direct bearing on the general development of Mosque architecture in
India.”^(<a href="#404">404</a>)</p>
<p>“On the other hand the use of the spoils of non-Muslim ruins was a
widely recognised feature in early Muslim architecture…^(<a href="#405">405</a>)</p>
<p>“Just as later Mughal painting is a harmonious blend of Persian and
Indian artistic tradition, so the Indo-Muslim architecture of Delhi and
Ajmer is a blend. In the Quwwat al-Islam at Delhi and the Arhai
din-ka-Jhopra at Ajmer, existing remains bear unmistakable evidence that
they were not merely compilations, but the distinctive, planned works of
professional architects…^(<a href="#406">406</a>)</p>
<p>“Although constructed of destroyed Hindu temples, the Mosques at Old
Delhi and Ajmer once and for all set the fashion to be followed by later
mosques in Muslim India…^(<a href="#407">407</a>)</p>
<p>“The early formative phase of Indo-Muslim architecture, marked by the
adaptation of Hindu, Buddhist or Jaina temples, is illustrated by the
oldest Mosques at Delhi, Bengal, Jaunpur, Daulatabad, Patan, etc. In
Malwa, also, spoils of Hindu temples were used…^(<a href="#408">408</a>)</p>
<p>“Creighton says, ‘It appears to have been the general practice of the
Muhammadan conquerors of India, to destroy all the temples of the
idolaters, and to raise Mosque out of their ruins.’ The statement is of
course a gross exaggeration, for innumerable contemporary Hindu and
Buddhist temples still exist in the cities of India once conquered by
the Muslims. ‘Abid ‘Ali seems to have carried the observation of
Creighton further when he remarks, ‘It seems to the writer that the
builder of the Mosque [Chhoto Sona Masjid at Gaud] had collected the
stones containing the figure of the Hindu gods from the citadel of Gaur
where temples must have existed in the time of the earlier Hindu kings.’
Incidentally, Ravenshaw gave illustrations of sculptured stones,
representing stone capitals and <em>Makara</em> gargoyles, which have been
discovered in Hazrat Pandua. Westmacott, however, thinks that the
circular stone given in Ravenshaw’s plate XXX ‘formed a part of the high
ornament or pinnacle with which both the Buddhist Stupas and later Hindu
temples were usually crowned. I have seen similar pieces at Debkot, and
elsewhere, often with a perforation through the centre, through which I
conjecture that a rod of metal, or perhaps a column of molten lead may
have been passed, to retain it in an upright position’. In the event of
a prodigious abundance of Hindu temple building material scattered all
over the province, it is difficult to pin-point the provenance of each
stray sculptured piece used in the mosques of Gaud and Hazrat Pandua.
The existence of any Hindu temple in the citadel or outside Gaud as
‘Abid ‘Ali tells us, is as difficult to prove as to obviate the fact
that no material was taken from Devikot or Bannagar in Dinajpur.
Contradicting the views of ‘Abid ‘Ali, Stapleton says, ‘On the other
hand from Manrique’s statement that in 1641, he saw figures of idols
standing in niches surrounded by carved grotesques and leaves in some
stone reservoirs in Gaur, it is possible that except during periods of
persecution the Muhammadan Kings of Gaur allowed idols and Hindu temples
to remain unmolested in their capital.’ Although examples of the use of
Hindu material are not scarce, as proved by the discovery of three
sculptured figures from Mahisantosh with Muslim ornament on the reverse
side, now in the Varendra Research Society Museum, it would be wrong to
say after Creighton that all the Hindu temples were desecrated by the
Muslims to procure building material…^(<a href="#409">409</a>)</p>
<p>“…The Indian Museum, Calcutta, as well as the <em>Bangiya Sahitya Parishad</em>
Museum, Calcutta, acquired a large number of architectural objects from
the ancient sites of Bengal, particularly, Gaud, Hazrat Pandua,
Bagerhat, Hughli, Rajshahi, Dinajpur and elsewhere. Besides freshly
quarried basalts, a large quantity of locally available building
materials was employed by the architects of Gaud, Hazrat Pandua and
elsewhere. Ravenshaw’s unwarranted observation that ‘Though it (Hazrat
Pandua) cannot boast of such antiquity as Gaud, its remains afford
stronger evidence than those of the latter city of its having been
constructed mainly from the materials of Hindoo buildings’, has been
brushed aside by Westmacott, who thinks that Hazrat Pandua is older than
Gaud. One of the strongest advocates of the Indianized form of Muslim
structures is Havell, who is too intolerant to allow any credit to the
Muslim builders for the use of radiating arches, domes, minarets,
delicate relief works. He maintains that the central <em>mihrab</em> of the
Adina Masjid (Pl. III) at Hazrat Pandua is so obviously Hindu in design
as hardly to require comments. While Havell writes that ‘The image of
<em>Vishnu</em> or <em>Surya</em> has trefoil arched canopy, symbolizing the aura’ of
the god, of exactly the same type as the outer arch of the <em>mihrab</em>,
Beglar says that the Muslims delighted in ‘placing the sanctum of his
orthodox cult (in this case the main prayer niche) on the spot, where
hated infidel had his sanctum’. Saraswati is even more emphatic on this
point when he contends, ‘An examination of the stones used in the
construction of the Adina Masjid (one of them bearing a Sanscrit
inscription, recording merely a name of <em>Indranath</em>, in the character of
the 9th century AD) and those lying about in heaps all round, reveals
the fact, which no careful observer can deny, that most of them came
from temples that once stood in the vicinity.’ Ilahi Bakhsh, Creighton,
Ravenshaw, Buchanan-Hamilton, Westmacott, Beglar, Cunnigham, King, and a
host of other historians and archaeologists bear glowing testimony to
the utilization of non-muslim materials (Fig. 3b &amp; Pl. V), but none of
them ventured to say that existing temples were dismantled and materials
provided for the construction of magnificent monuments in Gaud and
Hazrat Pandua.^(<a href="#410">410</a>)</p>
<p>“Creighton drew the sketches of a few Hindu sculptures which were
evidently used in the Chhoto Sona Masjid at Gaud. These are the image of
<em>Sivani</em>, the consort of <em>Siva, Varahaavatara</em> or <em>Vishnu</em> in the form
of a Boar, <em>Brahmani</em>, consort of Brahma. In the British Museum there
are a few images of Hindu and Buddhist character, such as the Brahmani,
sketched by Creighton, and the seated Buddha figure (Pls. XLI-XLII). The
Muslim builders out of sheer expediency felt no scruple to use these
fragments in their mosques by concealing the carved sides into the wall
and utilizing the flat reverse side of these black basalts for arabesque
design in shallow carvings. Piecemeal utilization of Hindu sculptures
were also to be seen in the earlier monuments, such as, the Mosque and
Tomb of Zafar Khan at Tribeni, the Mosque at Chhoto Pandua, the Adina
Masjid at Hazrat Pandua, etc. The British Museum and the Victoria and
Albert Museum, both in London, the Indian Museum and the <em>Bangiya
Sahitya Parishad</em> Museum, both at Calcutta, Varendra Research Society
Museum, Rajshahi, provide large specimens of carved stones and
architectural fragments used in the monuments of pre-Mughal Bengal.
Ravenshaw photographed a circular stone pedestal and a gargoyle, which
is now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Used obviously as the gargoyle in
the Adina Masjid, it ‘consists of a modification of an elephant’s head
with the eyes, horns and ears of a <em>sardula</em> (elephant).’ Cunningham
found in the pulpit of the Adina Masjid ‘a line of Hindu sculpture of
very fine bold execution.’ Innumerable Hindu lintels, pillars,
door-jambs, bases, capitals, friezes, fragments of stone carvings,
dadoes, etc., have been utilized in such a makeshift style as to render
‘improvisation’ well-nigh impossible. In many cases as observed in the
Quwwat al-Islam at Delhi and the Arhai-din-ka-Jhopra Mosque at Ajmer,
pillars were inverted, joining the base with capitals, suiting neither
pattern nor size. Still there is no denying the fact that Hindu
materials were utilized, yet it would be far-fetched to say that
existing Hindu temples were dismantled and converted by improvisation
into mosques as observed in the early phase of Muslim architecture in
Indo-Pak sub-continent. The ritual needs and structural properties of
the Hindus and the Muslims are so diametrically opposite as to deter any
compromise and, therefore, the early Muslim conquerors of Bengal said
their prayer in mosques built out of the fragments of Hindu materials in
the same way as their predecessors did at Delhi, Ajmer, Patan, Janupur,
Dhar and Mandu, and elsewhere. In the event [absence?] of any complete
picture of pre-Muslim Hindu art as practised in Gaud and Hazrat Pandua,
it is an exaggeration to hold the view after Saraswati that ‘indeed,
every structure of this royal city (Hazrat Pandua) discloses Hindu
materials in its composition, thus, disclosing that no earlier monument
was spared.”^(<a href="#411">411</a>)</p>
<p>“…During the Husain Shahi period the stone cutter’s art was thoroughly
practised and perfected, as walls of gates and mosques were adorned with
stone, either quarried from Rajmahal hills or obtained from some
existing buildings…^(<a href="#412">412</a>)</p>
<p>“…The British Museum, London, has in its collection two sculptured
pieces from Bengal, namely, the seated Buddha figure (Pl. XLIIa) and the
image of Brahmani (Pl. XLIa). Both these images have on their obverse
(Pls. XLIb, XLIIb) exquisitely carved diaper work of unmistakable Muslim
workmanship. The Indian Museum, Calcutta, has a stone slab carved on the
one side with the image of Durga, destroying <em>Mahisha</em> or
Buffalow-demon, and on the reverse arabesque. The panel consisting of a
scalloped arch with a lotus rosette on each of its sides, surrounded by
richly foliated devices, is undoubtedly a Muslim work.^(<a href="#413">413</a>)</p>
<p>“The Muslim calligraphers did not feel any scruple to utilize fragments
of Hindu or Jaina sculpture in carving out beautiful inscriptions in
elegant <em>Naskh, Thulth</em> and <em>Tughra</em>, keeping the images inside the
wall…”^(<a href="#414">414</a>)</p>
<p><em>Delhi</em></p>
<p>“…Delhi was the source of artistic inspiration for all the later
provincial schools of Indo-Muslim architecture. Codrington remarks, ‘At
Delhi, the Kutb-ul-Islam marks the beginning of Islamic architecture in
India.’ This formative phase of Mosque architecture in India began with
the random utilization of temple spoils, Hindu architraves, corbelled
ceilings, kumbha pillars with hanging bell-and-chain motifs, which were
organised to fulfil the needs of congregational prayer. It is said that
the columns of twenty-seven Hindu and Jaina temples were utilized in the
great Mosque, at Delhi, rightly called the ‘Might of Islam’. It was
built by Qutb-al-Din Aybak in AH 587/AD 1191-92 on an ancient pre-Muslim
plinth.^(<a href="#415">415</a>)</p>
<p>“…Originally there were five domes in the liwan all compiled of Hindu
fragments, as is evident from their corbelled interiors…^(<a href="#416">416</a>)</p>
<p>“…Incidentally, it may be recalled that Beglar carried out excavations
at the Quwat-al-Islam Mosque at Old Delhi under the supervision of
Cunningham and noticed the foundation of pre-Muslim temples
there…^(<a href="#417">417</a>)</p>
<p><em>Ajmer (Rajasthan)</em></p>
<p>“…To Iletmish we owe some of the finest Muslim works in India. The Arhai
din ka-Jhopra began by Qutab al-Din in AD 1198-99, was also completed by
him. Tod had said of it that it was ‘one of the most perfect as well as
the most ancient monuments of Hindu architecture’, on the evidence of
certain four-armed figures to be seen on the pillars…^(<a href="#418">418</a>)</p>
<p>“The Ajmer Mosque resembles the Delhi Mosque in its use of pre-Muslim
materials as well as in its courtyard plan, arched screen, columnar
<em>liwan</em> and <em>riwags</em> and use of reconstructed Hindu corbelled domes. All
these features, except the fragments of Hindu and Jain carvings used in
the work are essentially Islamic. The Ajmer Mosque indicates a further
improvement in Mosque design… As Sardar puts it, ‘These pillars have a
greater height than those at the Kutub, and are more elegant in their
sculpture and general appearance than the converted Mosques in Malwa and
Ahmedabad.’”^(<a href="#419">419</a>)</p>
<p><em>Badaun (Uttar Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The Jami Masjid of Badaun, also built by Iletmish is one of the largest
mosques in India. Following the traditional courtyard plan, it also
utilizes Hindu temple pillars. The entrance arches of the gateways
leading into the courtyard of the Mosque presumably recall those in the
great Mosques at Delhi and Ajmer…”^(<a href="#420">420</a>)</p>
<p><em>Bayana (Rajasthan)</em></p>
<p>“That the practice of utilizing the spoils of Hindu temples continued
throughout the reign of Sultan Iletmish is proved by the Mosque of Ukha
in Bayana (Uttar Pradesh), which is also on the site of a Hindu
temple…”^(<a href="#421">421</a>)</p>
<p><em>Dhar (Madhya Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The oldest of the Mosques in Malwa is the Kamal Maula Masjid which was
built in Dhar in AH 803/AD 1400. Both this Mosque and the slightly later
Jami or Lat Masjid are clearly adaptations of ruined Hindu temple
material…”^(<a href="#422">422</a>)</p>
<p><em>Mandu (Madhya Pradesh)</em></p>
<p>“The transfer of the capital from Dhar to Mandu by Dilwar Khan in AH
794/AD 1392, marks a new phase in the development of Mosque architecture
in Malwa. The Mosque built by him in C. AH 808/AD 1405-06 is oblong in
ground plan, the western side being formed by the liwan. Its roof is
supported by Hindu pillars…”^(<a href="#423">423</a>)</p>
<p><em>Gujarat</em></p>
<p>“It is true that Mosque architecture in Gujarat only began in the 14th
century. When ‘Ala-al-Din Khalji conquered and annexed the country to
the Delhi Sultanate in the later part of the 13th century, there still
flourished a singularly beautiful indigenous style of architecture. The
early monuments of Gujarat, notably at Patan (Anhilvada) tell the same
story of the demolition of local temples and the reconstruction of their
fragments…^(<a href="#424">424</a>)</p>
<p>“…In the beginning, at the Qutb, the Hindu element was confined
architecturally to the trabeate constructive methods, and to part of the
decoration, Islam contributing the plan and the embellishment of the
Arabic lettering. In Gujarat, notably in the entrance porches of the
Jami‘ Masjid at Cambay, much may fairly be described as literal
reconstruction of Hindu work, as units in the established plan of a
Muslim place of worship. These entrances have their parallels in the
pavilions and <em>mandapas</em> of Hindu and Jaina temples still standing, for
instance, at Modhera and Mount Abu…”^(<a href="#425">425</a>)</p>
<p><em>Patan (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“The earliest recorded building in Gujarat is the Adina Masjid at Patan
(Anhilvada), as stated above. This bears the same unusual name as that
of the Mosque built by Sikandar Shah at Hazrat Pandua about fifty years
later. The tomb of Sheikh Farid and the Adina Masjid at Patan, which are
dated C. AH 700/AD 1300, correspond in their utilization of Hindu
building material with the tomb and the Mosque of Zafar Khan Ghazi at
Tribeni in Hooghly, Bengal, which are dated C. AH 705/ AD 1305. The now
demolished Adina Masjid at Patan, is said to have had one thousand and
fifty pillars of marble and other stones taken from destroyed temples.
Erected by Ulugh Khan, ‘Ala’-al-Din Khalji’s Governor, it measures 400
feet by 300 feet…”^(<a href="#426">426</a>)</p>
<p><em>Bharuch (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“…Unlike the Patan Mosque, the Jami‘ Masjid of Bharoch, which is also
dated C. AH 700/AD 1300 is a new creation. Although it does incorporate
Hindu pillars, it is built on the usual Mosque plan with which we are
familiar in earlier works. The brackets of the incorporated pillars and
the carved interior of the corbelled domes are particularly fine. They,
of course, necessarily recall the much earlier work of the Quwwat
al-Islam at Delhi. It is important to realize that these primitive
methods were still being used in the Indian provinces two hundred years
after they were fully developed at Delhi…”^(<a href="#427">427</a>)</p>
<p><em>Khambhat (Gujarat)</em></p>
<p>“…The Mosque of Cambay demonstrates the imposition of Khalji features,
such as the arched screen of the <em>Jama‘at Khana</em> Masjid at the <em>Dargah</em>
of Nizam-al-Din Aulia in Delhi, upon the local trabeate forms of Gujarat
Hindu architecture. Codrington writes, ‘The Jami‘ Masjid at Cambay was
finished in 1325, and is typical of these earlier buildings. It has all
the appurtenances that Islam demands-cloisters, open court-yard, the
covered place for prayer, <em>mimbar</em> and <em>mihrab</em>-but only the west end is
in any sense Islamic. As at Delhi and Ajmir, the pillars of the
cloisters, and notably the entrance porches as a whole, are the relics
of sacked Hindu shrines…”^(<a href="#428">428</a>)</p>
<p><em>Deccan</em></p>
<p>“Like all other provinces of India, the Deccan, also, witnessed the
growth of a distinguished school of Muslim architecture. Its early phase
is also, characterized by the adaptation of local temples, for the
purpose of Muslim congregational prayer, as exemplified by the Deval
Mosque of Bodhan in Nizamabad, near Hyderabad, dated AD 1318, which was
formerly a Hindu shrine…”^(<a href="#429">429</a>)</p>
<p><em>Bodhan (Maharashtra)</em></p>
<p>“…It is said that the star-shaped Jaina Temple built in the Chalukya
style at Bodhan in the 9th or 10th century was, also, transformed into a
Mosque during the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq (AH 726-52/AD<br>
1325-51).”^(<a href="#430">430</a>)</p>
<p><em>Daulatabad (Maharashtra)</em></p>
<p>“The Mosque of Qutb al-Din Mubarak Khalji at Daulatabad, dated AH 718/AD
1318, is probably the earliest surviving Muslim structure in the Deccan.
It is a square, 260 feet each way, assembled into the usual orthodox
plan out of destroyed Hindu pillars, brackets, and
beams…”^(<a href="#431">431</a>)</p>
<p><em>Pandua (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“Beglar traces the origin of the Adina Masjid to pre-Muslim sources… He
bases his arguments on the point that if the Adina Masjid occupies the
site of a pre-Muslim Hindu temple, the name may be a reminiscent of
Adisur, the so-called founder of the hitherto unidentified temple dating
from the 7th century AD; however, he does not know that there is a
mosque at Patan, called Adina, and that it is a Persian term for
Friday. The use of fragments of Hindu or Buddhist architectural works in
the Masjid do [does?] not prove that the site was pre-Muslim. They may
have been brought there…”^(<a href="#432">432</a>)</p>
<p>“…Beglar suggests that the <em>mihrab</em> of the Adina Masjid was transferred
from a Hindu temple. He says, ‘Of the Hindu sculpture, the most striking
and superb is beyond question the trefoil arch and pillars of the main
prayer niche.’ But there are no grounds for his assertion. The Adina
Masjid <em>mihrab</em>, forming a single work of art, must be accepted as
contemporary with the fabric of the Masjid itself. But it must be
admitted that the style is local…^(<a href="#433">433</a>)</p>
<p>“Particular attention has been drawn to the curiously interesting
designs of the archivolt of the niche. The conventional grotesque Lion’s
head at the crown and the <em>Kinnara</em> and <em>Kinnari</em> at the haunches, which
appear in the lintel of the Vaishnava temple from Gaud, according to
many scholars have been transformed into graceful foliage, palmette and
sensuous tendrils…^(<a href="#434">434</a>)</p>
<p>“The discovery of an odd fragment of Hindu sculpture found built into
the steps of the staircase has led many scholars to ascribe a pre-Muslim
origin to the Adina Masjid. As Cunningham puts it, ‘The steps leading up
to the pulpit have fallen down, and, on turning over one of the steps I
found a line of Hindu sculpture of very fine and bold execution… The
main ornament is a line of circular panels… formed by continuous
intersecting lotus stalks. These are five complete panels, and two
half-panels which have been cut through. These two contain portions of
an elephant and a rhinoceros. In the complete panels are: (i) cow and a
calf; (ii) human figures broken; (iii) a goose; (iv) a man and woman and
a crocodile; (v) two elephants. The carving is deep and the whole has
been polished.’ This sculpture is still visible. It is, therefore, clear
that the exigencies of the circumstances led to the utilization of some
Hindu materials available on the site. Nevertheless, such mutilated
fragments hardly testify to the fact that the Adina Masjid was built on
the ruins of an ancient Indian temple.^(<a href="#435">435</a>)</p>
<p>“The western wall of the northern prayer hall is pierced by two openings
on either side of die zenana gallery, which reduce the number of niches
(Fig. 3) between the pilaster of the back walls from the 16 found in the
southern prayer hall to 14. These postern gateways (Figs. 3, 9, &amp; Pls.
IV, V), are built out of elements of Hindu door frames and, therefore,
are unusual features, rarely found in Indian Mosques. It is hard to
believe that they were provided for the use of the general worshippers.
Probably they were for the use of the attendants, palanquin-bearers and
entourage of the King and his ladies, who entered the Mosque through the
adjoining Ladies’ vestibule.^(<a href="#436">436</a>)</p>
<p>“…However, there is one exception shown in the northern hall, which
differs from the other semi-circular niches. Here the trefoil arch
corresponds generally with that of the central <em>mihrabs</em>. The arch
itself has a superimposed ribbed roof, recalling Hindu architecture. The
face of the trefoil is decorated with a lotus and diamond band, the
pilasters on either side having <em>kumbha</em> bases and looped garlands on
their shafts. All these details are different from the rest of the
decorative motifs in the Adina Masjid. But there are no grounds for the
suggestion that the work is Hindu or that it is built up of fragments of
a destroyed Hindu temple. The space between the pilasters of this
<em>mihrab</em> and the stone-face of the brick wall is filled with fragmentary
remains of Hindu sculpture.^(<a href="#437">437</a>)</p>
<p>“…The two postern gateways and the two doors are already mentioned.
Beglar pointed out that the door frames of all these four door ways are
built up of fragments from some other buildings. He identifies the work
as being Hindu but admits that he does not know any local source from
their fragments. The work is more or less of the same kind as that to be
seen in the postern gate. In all these doorways various Indian motifs
attracts undivided attention. These include pot and foliage, pilasters,
door guardians and the intertwined <em>nagas</em> on the lintel. The
utilization of non-Muslim materials in the Adina Masjid as well as in
later Mosques in Gaud and Hazrat Pandua is supported by two fragments in
the British Museum. They are cut in basalt and the first shows finely
cut Muslim diaper work on one side and the figure of Buddha on the other
(Pls. XLII, a-b). Another fragment has the image of probably the goddess
Brahmani on the other side (Pls. XLI, a-b). The work indicates that
these fragments came from Gaud or Hazrat Pandua.^(<a href="#438">438</a>)</p>
<p>“…The entrance gateway to the Minar at Chhoto Pandua as well as that of
the Eklakhi Mausoleum at Hazrat Pandua (Pl. XVI) provide parallels for
zenana gatways. The floor of the zenana gallery with its worn basalt
paving slabs is supported by the squat pillars of the prayer hall
below. These support bays roofed by a corbelled construction of plain
slabs placed across the corners of the bays. At earlier mosques, such as
the Quwwat al-Islam, internal domes constructed in this way were removed
from Hindu temples. Here the old Indian method is still utilized with
fresh material…^(<a href="#439">439</a>)</p>
<p>“A curiously interesting feature of the Adina Masjid is the square
structure, adjoining the outer wall of the <em>qibla</em> on the northern side
of the central <em>mihrab</em>. It communicates with the zenana gallery by
lintellect doorways, formed by Hindu door jambs as stated
earlier. According to Beglar it measures externally 54 feet by 48 feet,
whereas ‘Abid ‘Ali notes that this roofless annexe is 42 feet square. It
stands on a very high plinth, raising the floor to the level of the
ladies’ gallery. The plinth is built of random rubble work with
conventionalised Buddhist railing ornament resembling those in the
dadoes of the <em>qibla</em> wall of the mosque.^(<a href="#440">440</a>)</p>
<p>“The real character as well as the distinguishing features of the Adina
Masjid have yet to be determined. In the present crumbling state of this
one-time ‘wonder of the world’, as Cunningham calls it, it is well nigh
impossible to say whether this magnificent mosque occupies the site of
any Hindu or Buddhist temple. A group of scholars failed to see in the
impressive Adina Masjid anything more than a mere assemblage of Hindu or
Buddhist fragments, arranged skilfully to adhere to a mosque plan. Ilahi
Bakhsh started the controversy when he wrote, ‘It is worth observing
that in front of the <em>chaukath</em> (lintel) of the Adina Masjid, there was
a broken and polished idol, and that there were other idols lying about.
So it appears that, in fact, this mosque was originally an idol-temple.’
Beglar steps up this controversy by saying, ‘the Adina Masjid occupies
the site, of a once famous, or at least a most important, and highly
ornamented, pre-Muhammadan shrine’; he depends for his arguments on a
Proto-Bengali inscription (Fig. 4b) discovered in the building which
bears the name of Brahma. Saraswati seems to have carried the thesis too
far when he writes, ‘an examination of the stones used in the
construction of the Adina Mosque (one of them bearing a Sanskrit
inscription recording merely a name, Indranath, in character of the 9th
century) and those lying about in heaps all around, reveals the fact,
which no careful observer can deny, that most of them came from temples
that once stood in the vicinity.’ Beglar even went so far as to
pin-point ‘the sanctum of the temple, judging from the remnants of heavy
pedestals of statues, now built into the pulpit, and the superb canopied
trefoils, now doing duty as prayer niches, stood where the main prayer
niche now stands; nothing would probably so tickle the fancy of a bigot,
as the power of placing the sanctum of his orthodox cult (in this case
the main prayer niche) on the spot, where hated infidel had his
sanctum’. The existence of the foundation of a Hindu Temple in the Adina
Masjid is as far-fetched as to consider the circular pedestal to the
west of the <em>qibla</em> wall as remains of a Buddhist stupa (Fig. 3). It may
be the base of a detached minar, as similar examples are to be seen in
the mosques of Egypt, Persia and India…”^(<a href="#441">441</a>)</p>
<p><em>Tribeni (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“The existing tomb and mosque of Zafar Khan Ghazi at Tribeni is another
example of contemporary Hindu fragments being utilized in Muslim
structure…^(<a href="#442">442</a>)</p>
<p>“The Mosque of Zafar Khan Ghazi is the earliest known example of Mosque
architecture in Bengal, and ‘is certainly the oldest in Bengal far
anterior to any building at Gaud and Hazrat Pandua’. Marking the
earliest phase of Muslim building activities, it incorporates fragments
of non-Muslim monuments, like those of the Quwwat al-Islam Mosque in
Delhi. R.D. Banerjee is of opinion that ‘the Mosque of Tribeni was most
probably a Vaishnava temple but relics of Buddhism and Jainism were
found…’^(<a href="#443">443</a>)</p>
<p>“…Unmistakable Hindu workmanship is evident in the mutilated figures in
some of the architectural fragments used &ndash; a phenomenon to be observed
in the Adina Masjid at Hazrat Pandua, dated AH 776/AD 1374. There are
five <em>mihrabs</em> in the <em>qibla</em> wall, the most striking being the central
one. Tastefully carved multifoil brick arch of the central mihrab is
supported by slender stone pillars of some Hindu temple…^(<a href="#444">444</a>)</p>
<p>“…The utilization of non-Muslim building materials is to be taken as a
matter of expediency for no mosque plan was ever superimposed on the
traditional ground plan of temple architecture. In the light of this
phenomena the mosques can hardly be regarded as mere improvisations of
existing temples, as stated by R.D. Banerjee in the case of the Mosque
of Zafar Khan. The Muslim architects did not feel any scruple to employ
fragments of Hindu sculpture still bearing traces of iconographical art
in their mosques, and furthermore Hindu workmanship is evident in the
delicate stone carvings and sensuous tendrils, and corbelled
domes.”^(<a href="#445">445</a>)</p>
<p><em>Gaud (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“…Both Cunningham and Marshall accept Creighton’s suggestion that the
Lattan Masjid was built in the year AH 880/AD 1475…^(<a href="#446">446</a>)</p>
<p>“The <em>qibla</em> wall has three semi-circular niches, the central one being
bigger than the side ones. These are all encrusted with glazed tiles.
The <em>mihrab</em> to the north of the central niche has fragments of Hindu
sculpture built into it…^(<a href="#447">447</a>)</p>
<p>“…Although less ornate than those of the southern prayer chamber in the
Adina Masjid, the Tantipara Masjid pillars have square bases, moulded
bands and cubical abaci. Brown says that the pillars of this mosque are
‘of the square and chamfered variety originally part of a Hindu temple’,
but this was not so. They are contemporary with the building. Certainly
work of this character is known in Hindu building, and this seems to
have misled Brown.^(<a href="#448">448</a>)</p>
<p>“…Two rows of chamfered pillars, each carrying 5 pointed arches, divide
the interior of the [Chhoto Sona] Mosque into 3 longitudinal aisles.
In each row there are 4 pillars of black basalt which in their moulded
string-courses, cubical pedestal, dog-tooth ornament and square abacus
recall those of the supporting pillars of the zenana gallery in the
Adina Masjid. Evidently they are much more attenuated in shape in the
Chhoto Sona Masjid than those in the Adina Masjid. It is hard to
ascertain their origins, but considering the enormous quantity of Hindu
spoil used in the Chhoto Sona Masjid (Pls. XLI, XLII) and comparing its
pillars with the carved stone pillars at the Bari Dargah which
originally must have been brought from the Adina Masjid it may be said
that they were taken from unidentifiable Hindu temples. ^(<a href="#449">449</a>)</p>
<p>“…Many of the stones used for casing the wall to give the illusion of a
stone monument from distance are evidently Hindu. To quote Creighton,
‘The stone used in these mosques had formerly belonged to Hindu temples
destroyed by the zealous Muhammadans,’ as will be evident from an
inspection of Plates XLI and XLII, representing two slabs taken from
this Building. Creighton’s painting XVI represents a stone with the
image of the Hindu deity, <em>Vishnu</em>, in the Boar incarnation, with
shallow diaper carving on the reverse side. The figure of Sivani, the
consort of Siva, one of the Hindu triad, appears on another stone
sketched by Creighton (painting XVII). The mother figure evidently drawn
from sculptured stones used in the Small Golden Mosque is that of
Brahmani, given in Plate XLIa (Creighton’s painting XVII). It is very
interesting to point out in connection with the figure of Brahmani that
it agrees in meticulous execution of details and perfection of style
with that of the British Museum piece. Therefore, it is certain that
Creighton drew his sketch from this black stone which curiously displays
diaper work on the other side (Pl. XLIb) similar to that of Creighton’s
Plate XVI. Arabesque design in shallow stone carving, resembling
delicate tapestry, appears also in another superb black basalt piece,
shown in Plate XLIb, now in the British Museum. It has the image of a
seated Buddha on one side thereby again indicating the utilization of
non-Muslim material (Pl. XLIIa). This fascinating piece may well be
attributed to the Chhoto Sona Masjid on the grounds of the close
similarity of its diaper work with that of the stone sketched by
Creighton in his Plate XVI, and of the existence of gilding in the
shallow carvings of the diaper work.”^(<a href="#450">450</a>)</p>
<p><em>Rampal (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“The famous Mosque of Baba Adam, (Fig. 17) the patron saint of the
locality in the ancient Hindu site of Rampal where Raja Ballal Sena
built his palace in the district of Dacca is an impressive architectural
monument of pre-Mughal Bengal.^(<a href="#451">451</a>)</p>
<p>“…Measuring 43 feet by 36 feet externally and 34 feet by 22 feet
internally, the Mosque incorporated a number of beautifully carved stone
pillars of unmistakable Hindu workmanship…^(<a href="#452">452</a>)</p>
<p>“In the construction of this 6-domed mosque, measuring 36 feet by 24
feet, considerable amount of locally available materials from
dilapidated Hindu monuments were employed as evident in the black carved
basalts of the pillars, <em>mihrabs</em>, epigraphic slabs,
etc…^(<a href="#453">453</a>)</p>
<p><em>Chhota Pandua (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“‘Next to Satgaon’, writes D.G. Crawford, ‘Pandua is the oldest place of
Hughli District-once the capital of a Hindu Raja and is famous as the
site of a great victory gained by the Musulmans under Shah Safi over the
Hindus in about AD 1340.’ Besides the Mosque and Tomb of Shah Safiuddin,
the most outstanding architectural project of great magnitude is the
Great Mosque at Chhoto Pandua… O’Malley and M.M. Chakravarti differ from
Blockmann in ascribing Buddhist origin to these pillars and maintain
that they were probably quarried from a Hindu temple. As put forward by
Cunningham, ‘The Mosque stands on a mound once die site of a Hindu
temple, the pillars of which now support this mean-looking barn-like
Masjid.’ It would be far-fetched to maintain that the Great Mosque at
Chhoto Pandua was built on the very foundation of a Hindu temple, like
the improvised Tomb of Zafar Khan Ghazi at Tribeni, dated 14th century
AD.”^(<a href="#454">454</a>)</p>
<p><em>Sadipur (Bengal)</em></p>
<p>“…A.K. Bhattacharya points out that an inscription in Arabic, carved in
<em>Tughra</em> is found on the reverse of an image of Adinath, which is
recovered from a ruined <em>Dargah</em> in the village Sadipur, P.S. Kaliachak,
Malda.”^(<a href="#455">455</a>)</p>

<p><a href="#7a">⁷</a> Ibid., p. 127. “<em>Budd</em>” in Islamic parlance means an idol. The
word is derived from “<em>Buddha</em>” whose idols were known as <em>Budd or But</em>
in Iran long before the Muslims conquered that land. The Muslims
borrowed the word and extended it to mean all idols. The Iranian text of
<em>Bundahism</em> translated by H.W. Bailey says that “The demon <em>But</em> is that
which they worship in India and in his image a spirit is resident which
is worshipped as <em>Bodasf</em>” (<em>Indian Studies, Volume in Honour of Edward
James Rapson, edited by J. Bloch et al., London, 1931, Delhi Reprint</em>,
1988, p. 279). <em>Bodasf</em> is Persian for Bodhisattva.</p>

<p><a href="#409a">⁴⁰⁹</a> Ibid., pp. 163-64. His statement that “innumerable Hindu
and Buddhist temples still exit in the     cities of India once
conquered by the Muslims”, is a figment of his imagination. No city in
North India can show a temple from pre-Islamic times.</p>
<p><a href="#410a">⁴¹⁰</a> Ibid., pp. 170-71. In subsequent passages he himself says
that existing buildings were quarried for stones used in Mosques.
Medieval Muslim historians say that all Hindu temples were destroyed and
mosques raised at Lakhnauti, the site of Gaud, and Pandau.</p>

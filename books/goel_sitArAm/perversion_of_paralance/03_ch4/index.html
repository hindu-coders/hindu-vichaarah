  <h2 id="chapter-4---the-character-of-leftist-language">CHAPTER 4 - The Character of Leftist Language</h2>
<p>Ever since its inauguration in the opening years of this century, the
language of Leftism has been the loudest in denouncing this or that
imperialism. Quite often, it has imagined or invented an imperialism
where none existed. This exercise has helped it to hide the fact that it
itself is the latest language of imperialism.</p>
<p>Imperialism down the ages has evolved and employed a number of
languages. The verbiage has varied according to differences of time and
clime. But all languages of imperialism have shared certain
characteristics in common. The language of Leftism passes this test
quite creditably.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="imperialist-characteristics">IMPERIALIST CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>To start with, every language of imperialism invokes an inscrutable
entity as its source and sanction. This entity reveals its final and
irreversible will to an incomparable person. All pronouncements of this
person are placed beyond the reach of human reason or experience. They
have to be accepted on faith. Compared to faith, reason and experience
are found to be faulty faculties. These faculties can fulfil themselves
only if they follow and fortify faith.</p>
<p>Second, every language of imperialism divides human history into two
sharply separated periods - an age of darkness which prevailed before
the birth of the incomparable person, and an age of light which followed
thereafter. The entire past history of every nation preceding the age of
light is painted black so that nothing in which a nation can take pride
is left unscathed.</p>
<p>Third, every language of imperialism divides mankind into two mutually
exclusive camps &ndash; the believers who accept the dogmas propoundded by
the incomparable person, and the unbelievers who doubt or reject those
dogmas. The believers are placed under a categorical imperative to make
war on the unbelievere till the latter are either converted or killed
off. The believers do not have to be better human beings in terms of
morality or character. It is sufficient if they have fervour and
ferocity born of faith.</p>
<p>Fourth, every language of imperialism bands together all believers
everywhere into a world brotherhood which cuts across all national
bounds of geography, history and culture. As a corollary, every nuance
of nationalism gets denounced as narrow and out of date. For all
practical purposes, it is an invitation to every nation to renounce its
independent identity and become a colony where the incomparable person
was born or where his dogmas first acquired the backing of armed force.
This dead uniformity into which nations are stream-rollered is hailed as
universality.</p>
<p>Fifth, every language of imperialism propounds that the inscrutable
entity has mandated the whole earth to the incomparable person who, in
his turn, has bequeathed it to the brotherhood. So when the brotherhood
or any section of it mounts an aggression, it automatically becomes a
war of liberation. The brotherhood is only claiming what already belongs
to it. Sixth, every language of imperialism lays down two
inevitabilities &ndash; an inevitable victory of the believers, and an
inevitable defeat of the unbelievers. The believers are told that the
inscrutable entity is on their side and no power on earth can stop their
onward march. The intention is to enthuse the believers so that they
spare no effort and demoralise the unbelievers so that they surrender or
offer only half-hearted resistance.</p>
<p>Seventh, every language of imperialism equips the believers with an
immeasurable degree of self-righteousness. They are told that the lives,
liberties, properties and honour of the unbelievers have already been
forefeited by the inscrutable entity. The believers, therefore, commit
no crime when they kill, enslave, plunder and humiliate the unbelievers.
This gives a good conscience to the believers while they indulge in an
endless spree of bloodshed and vandalism. In fact, their crimes become
meritorious deeds.</p>
<p>Lastly, the unbelievers are accused of all sorts of crimes committed by
them by the very fact of being what they are. In fact, the whole
life-history of every unbeliever becomes a catalogue of crimes. The
intention is to debar the unbelievers from any sympathy from any
quarters. At the sme time, the crimes committed against them are
explained away in terms of their own crimes.</p>
<p>In the lines that follow, I will present a panoramic view of those
languages of imperialism which have invaded India, at one time or the
other. Incidentally, the list is almost exhaustive. India has been
plagued by every principal language of imperialism invented by human
ingenuity so far.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="language-of-islamic-imperialism">LANGUAGE OF ISLAMIC IMPERIALISM</h2>
<p>The language of Islamic imperialism was the first language of
imperialism to invade India. Its standard-bearers were the Arab and the
Turkish armies which came in successive waves from the middle of the 7th
to the middle of the 18th century. It had proclaimed that</p>
<ol>
<li>Allah had revealed his final and irreversible will to prophet
Muhammad born in Mecca in 570 A.D. and buried in Medina in 632 A.D;</li>
<li>Human history before the prophethood of Muhammad was jahiliya (era
of ignorance) and the light of truth dawned on earth only after that
date;</li>
<li>That date divided mankind into momins (believers) and kafirs
(unbelievers) and the momins should become mujahids (holy warriors)
by making war on the kafirs;</li>
<li>All momins everywhere were members of the millat (brotherhood) which
recognised no national frontiers or peculiarities of national
culture;</li>
<li>Allah had mandated the entire earth, including Sind and Hind, to
prophet Muhammad who, in his turn, had bequeathed it to the millat
which had thus acquired an inalienable right to conquer Sind and
Hind and cleanse them of kafir (infidelism);</li>
<li>The triumph of the millat was inevitable in Sind and Hind, as
elsewhere and the mujahids should make all efforts to expedite that
end;</li>
<li>Allah al-Rahman, al-Rahim (the Compassionate, the Merciful) had
already forefeited the lives, liberties, properties and honour of
hindu kafirs and the mijahids should kill the Hindus, capture their
women and children, plunder their properties, demolish their temples
desecrate their idols, burn their scriptures, humiliate their holy
men and extirpate every vestige of their culture;</li>
<li>Hindu were kafirs wallowing in the sin of shirk (idolatory) and
fully deserved the punishment meted out to them by the momins.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the place to tell the story of Islamic imperialism in India
&ndash; how Hindus refused to be impressed by Allah and his gibberish and how
they waged a long-drawn-out war of resistance till the barbarians were
brought to book. What is relevant in our present context is that
although Hindus overcame Islamic imperialism, they failed to see through
the language of that imperialism. Hindu masses continued to react with
revulsion towards everything Islamic. But Hindu saints, scholars social
reformers and scribes came to accept Islam as a religion as good as
their own Sanatana Dharma. This self-deception is still working as a
potent poison in whatever remains of India after more than thirteen
hundred years of Islamic aggression.</p>
<p>LANGUAGE OF CHRISTIAN IMPERIALISM The next language of imperialism to
plague India was that of Christian imperialism. It first came to this
country in the company of Portuguese pirates in the opening years of the
16th century. Some of these pirates were dressed as priests and friars
and introduced themselves as missionaries of Jesus Christ. It was this
latter tribe which trumpeted that</p>
<ol>
<li>The only True God had sent his Only Son, Jesus, to atone for the
sins of all mankind by dying on the Cross in Jerusalem in 33 A.D.;</li>
<li>Human history before the Crucifixion of Jesus was an era of darkness
and the light of divinity descended on earth exactly on that date;</li>
<li>Mankind became divided into Christians and heathens after the death
of Jesus and the Christians were under a divine obligation to wage a
constant crusade against the Heathens;</li>
<li>All Christians everywhere were united in the Catholic Church, the
holy Mother of Mankind, which recognised no national divisions or
distinctions;</li>
<li>The Only True God had mandated the entire earth including India to
his Only Son who, in his turn had bequeathed it to the Catholic
Church which had thus inherited an inalienable right to liberate
India, as all other lands, from the horrors of Heathenism;</li>
<li>The victory of the Catholic Church over India as elsewhere, was
inevitable and Christian soldiers and missionaries should endeavour
to expedite that end;</li>
<li>The Only True God, in his infinite mercy, had forefeited the lives,
liberties, properties and honour of the Gentoo (Hindu) heathers and
the Catholic Church was authorised to demolish their temples, to
smash their idols, to burn their scriptures, to persecute their
priests, to close down their schools and seminaries, to prohibit
their public celebrations, to sequester their movable and immovable
possessions, to separate them from their children, to convert their
women into concubines for Christian soldiers and priests, to exile
those sections of their population which proved recalcitrant, and to
massacre those who offered armed resistance;</li>
<li>The Gentoo heathens had lived for long in the sin and shame of
polytheism and pantheism and their crimes deserved drastic
punishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the place to narrate why conversions to Christianity
remained confined to some small sections of Hindu society and how the
bulk of that society repudiated the falsehoods retailed by the
misionaries. What is relevant in the present context is that in spite of
the warnings from a succession of Hindu sages - Maharshi Dayananda
Bankim Chandra, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo and Mahatma Gandhi - a
section of the Endlish-educated Hindu elite became enamoured of
Christianity and recognised it as a religion. That mistake has enabled
Christian imperialism to continue making inroads onto Hindu society.</p>

<h2 id="language-of-western-imperialism">LANGUAGE OF WESTERN IMPERIALISM</h2>
<p>The language of Western imperialism came to India as the language of
British imperialism. But it was shared in common by the French, the
Dutch, the Portuguese, the Belgians, the Italians the Germans and
Russians who had enslaved many nations in Asia and Africa by force of
superior arms. Essentially, it was the old language of Christian
imperialism. But it was dressed up in a secular verbiage. Its tenets
were as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>March of human history had proved the cultural superiority of the
white man and placed him in the vanguard of human progress;</li>
<li>Human history before the 16th and 17th centuries was an age of
barbarism, and an era of enlightenment had commenced since then;</li>
<li>Mankind was divided into the civilised people of Europe on the one
hand, and the savage races of asia and Africa on the other.</li>
<li>The white race was a disticnt fraternity designated by history to
dominate the whole world, including India;</li>
<li>History had placed the people of India in charge of the white man
from Britain who should bear the burden of his civilising mission
without bothering about the negative attitudes of the natives.</li>
<li>History was heading towards an inevitable triumph of the Western
civilisation and the British should work towards that fulfilment in
India;</li>
<li>History had rendered out of date the political system, social order,
economic organisation and cultural traditions of India, and the
British should smash them be by force or reform them out of
recognition without any hesitation.</li>
<li>Hindus had lived for long in a medley of primitive superstitions and
amply deserved whatever suffering the British civilising mission had
imposed upon them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the place to tell how the British proceeded with their
civilising mission in this country and what havoc they wrought in course
of a hundred and fifty years. What is relevant in the present context is
that althought the British Raj has departed, the language of British
imperialsim has survived almost intact in the language of our
present-day ruling class which has inherited the British mantle. India
to them is a backward or underdeveloped or developing country which
should look to the West for ideological inspiration as well as concrete
models in all matters of major importance. This has reduced the Indian
elite to brown apes of the West and the Indian people to a pack of
handicapped children. The havoc which the language of British
imperialism is still continuing to work in all spheres of Indian life
belies description.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="language-of-communist-imperialism">LANGUAGE OF COMMUNIST IMPERIALISM</h2>
<p>The language of Communist imperialism started trickling into India soon
after the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November, 1917. Leading
Western thinkers like Bertrand Russell have identified Communism as a
Christian heresy. Small wonder that the language of Communist
imperialism is the same as that of Christian imperialism, except for the
Marxist trappings in which Lenin has disguised it. This becomes obvious
when we contemplate its following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forces of Production, maturing in the womb of human history became
self-conscious in Lenin and enabled him to snap the chain of world
capitalism in Russia;</li>
<li>Human history which had so far been a history of class oppression
and class struggle now took a decisive turn towards a classless
communist society;</li>
<li>The whole world, including India, now became a battle ground between
forces of capitalist reaction on the one hand and forces of
proletarian revolution on the other;</li>
<li>The proletariat in every country including India, became part of an
international comraderie which had no use for nationalism in any
shape or form;</li>
<li>The Communist International, the vanguard of the world proletariat,
had inherited the entire earth, including India, from the Forces of
Production and it was its inalienable right to promote a proletarian
revolution in every country;</li>
<li>The victory of the International was inevitable and its Sections in
different countries, including India, should endeavour to expedite
that end;</li>
<li>The existing political, social, cultural and economic institutions
in India had been rendered outmoded by the Forces of Production and
the Communist Party of India, a Section of the Communist
International, should smash them so that the last vestiges of
feudalism capitalism and colonialism were wiped out;</li>
<li>The fedual lords and capitalists in India had conspired with British
imperialism in order to keep the Indian people enslaved and they
deserved to be destroyed together with their political party, the
Indian National Congress.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the place to tell how the Communist Party of India has
functioned as a fifth-column of Soviet Russia for nearly sixty-seven
years. What is relevant in the present context is that, although the
Communist Party of India has failed to consolidate any substantial
political base, the spread of the language of Communist imperialism has
been phenomenal due to causes which we have described in a previous
chapter. By now, this language has become the standard language of
Leftism in india, whatever the names by which various Leftist parties
and factions describe themselves.</p>
<p>What is still more significant, the language of Communist imperialism
operates in close cooperation with the languages of Islamic, Christian
and Western imperialism and has succeeded, for the time being, in
driving away or putting on the defensive the language of Indian
nationalism. This becomes crystal clear when we examine the history and
role of the Leftist language ever since it invaded India in the early
twenties of this century.</p>

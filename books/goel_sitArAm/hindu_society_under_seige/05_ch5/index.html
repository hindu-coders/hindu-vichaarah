  <p><strong>5. The Communist Conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>(<em>This article was written in 1981. Now the Soviet Union has disappeared
from the scene and the Communist movement in India does not know whom to
serve. But its hostility towards Hindu society and culture remains
undiminished. It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will
be bought over, in due course, by some other power or powers hostile to
positive Indian nationalism. A Communist cannot help being a traitor to
his country and his people.</em>)</p>
<p>We have so far discussed the role of the residues of foreign rule in
India vis-a-vis Hindu society. We have characterised Islamism as
malevolent, Christianism as mischievous, and Macaulayism as mild, though
like a slow poison. Now we shall take up Communism which, though not
exactly a residue of foreign rule, is yet a foreign imposition of the
most malignant character.</p>
<p>But before we proceed, we wish to make it clear that nothing in this
article should be construed as a hostile criticism of Indo-Soviet
relations. Our friendship with the Soviet Union has matured in the midst
of a fast moving world. We value that friendship, though we would like
to emphasize that the Soviet Union needs India’s friendship as much as
India needs hers. We also warn that neither the Soviet Union nor the
Communist movement in our country should be permitted to close our other
options while we are faced and have to deal with American
interventionism.</p>
<p>Though Communism in India cannot be characterised as a residue of the
British rule, the British Government did make some substantial
contributions to its growth. In the ‘thirties, that Government
encouraged non-Communist revolutionaries in its jails to read Communist
literature. This was done in order to wean them away from “terrorism.”
Many of them came out as convinced Communists while still wearing the
halo of national heroes. Again, during the Second World War, that
Government partronised, financed and fraternised with the Communist
Party of India and helped it attain the stature of an independent
political party.</p>
<p>Ideologically, Communism in India is, in several respects, a sort of
extension of Macaulayism, a residue of the British rule. That is why
Communism is strongest today in those areas where Macaulayism had
earlier spread its widest spell. That is why Macaulayism has always been
on the defensive and apologetic vis-a-vis Communism. Macaulayism has
always tried to understand and explain away the misdeeds of Communism in
this country. It has sadly deplored, if not condoned, as misguided
idealism even the most heinous crimes of the Communists. The long record
of our parliamentary debates is a witness of how, after the death of
Sardar Patel, die treasury benches have always evinced an awed deference
towards utterly unparliamentary and downright demagogic vituperations
from Communist members.</p>
<p>This ideological affinity between Communism and Macaulayism is
ultimately derived from a common source in the modern West-materialistic
metaphysics, evolutionistic sociology, utilitarian ethics, hedonistic
psychology, etc. In this world-view, man is essentially a <em>homo
fabricus</em>, a tool-maker or mechanic. A centralised economy and an
urbanised society are a natural follow-up of this world-view. In this
larger ideological context, Marxism is a logical culmination of
Capitalism. Marx reserved his choicest praise for Capitalism and his
choicest abuse for what he denounced as Utopian Socialism. The only
crime of this other school of Socialism was that it objected to the
relentless drive of Capitalism towards total mechanisation,
industrialisation and centralisation, reducing the individual human
being to a helpless entity.</p>
<p>The difference between Capitalism in the West and Communism in the East
of Europe arose because Capitalist societies retained philosophical
eclecticism and political pluralism as expressed in parliamentary
democracy, a free press and free trade unions. Communist societies, on
the other hand, froze Marxist philosophy into a closed system of
orthodoxy. This led to heresy-hunting which in due course reduced
Marxism to the status of a Semitic creed like Christianity and Islam.
Bertrand Russell was not far wrong when he identified Communism as a
Christian heresy. It has acquired all the characteristic features of the
Christian Church such as the <em>only</em> Saviour, the <em>only</em> Revelation, the
<em>only</em> Pope, the <em>only</em> priesthood, the only baptism, and the only
sacraments.  Communist regimes could not help becoming totalitarian
enemies of human freedom.</p>
<p>Yet, and in spite of all ideological affinities, Communism is not a
variety of Macaulayism, though the former fattens on the latter. The
inspiration of Communism did not derive from the West. Its gospel as
well guidance emanated from an opposite direction, the Soviet Union,
except for a brief period when China also shared the honour of being a
hallowed land.</p>
<p>This is not the occasion to dwell on the philosophy of Marxism or the
strategy and tactics of Leninism or Stalinism or Maoism.  Here we are
dealing with the problem which Communism poses before Hindu society and
culture. In any case, Communism in India, has never had much use for
Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism except as an ideological
window-dressing to impress the intelligentsia at large and hoodwink the
party cadres whenever the Party line has to be shifted swiftly.</p>
<p>What, then, is Communism?</p>
<p>Scholars and historians of Communism far more competent than the present
writer have documented it beyond a shadow of doubt that Communism has
been an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in its drive towards world
domination, particularly since Stalin emerged as the undisputed leader
of the Soviet Union as well as the world Communist movement. The
unmasking of Stalin as a mass-murderer by Khruschev has blown up the
myth of Soviet Russia as a proletarian paradise. The split with China
has splintered the world Communist monolith. But, by and large, the
movement has recovered from these shocks, retained its
self-righteousness and resumed its role in the service of Soviet foreign
policy.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, natural and inevitable that Communism should come into
conflict with <em>positive</em> nationalism in every country. India cannot be
an exception. By <em>positive</em> nationalism we mean a nationalism which
draws its inspiration from its own cultural heritage and socio-political
traditions. Such a nationalism has its own way of looking at world
events and evaluating the alignment of world forces. Such a nationalism
is guided by its own past experience in safeguarding its interests and
pursuing its goals. These interests and goals may coincide or agree with
the interests and goals of Soviet foreign policy at some particular
stage of world politics. But it is equally likely that they may not.</p>
<p>This basic dissonance between Communism and <em>positive</em> nationalism in
India was fully and finally dramatised during the Second World War. The
Communist Party of India had, since its inception, opposed British
imperialism in India and stood for its immediate and violent overthrow.
The Party had also opposed the Muslim League which it had characterised
as a collaborationist conspiracy of landed interests. In the eyes of
Indian freedom fighters, therefore, the Party represented a
revolutionary fringe of the nationalist movement. The Congress Socialist
Party even allowed its platform to be used by the Communist Party of
India which was working under a British ban. But the curtain was raised
suddenly in 1941 when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and the real face
of Communism was revealed for all who could see.</p>
<p>The Congress leadership had tried to negotiate a settlement with the
British for two long years. Finding the British attitude adamant, the
Congress decided in August 1942 to launch the Quit India Movement. The
Communists in the Congress opposed the Quit India resolution in the AICC
Session at Bombay. They propounded that the imperialist war had been
transformed into a people’s war simply because the Soviet Union had been
invaded by an enemy of Britain.</p>
<p>The freedom movement forged ahead under its own inspiration. But the
Communist Party of India moved full steam in the opposite direction.
British imperialism now became British bureaucracy for the Communists,
the Muslim League a spokesman of the Muslim mass upsurge, and the demand
for Pakistan a legitimate expression of Muslim nationalism which the
Congress should concede immediately. The rest of the story is
well-known-the story of how the freedom movement was branded as a
movement for collaboration with Fascism, how Subhash Chandra Bose was
denounced as a Nazi dog and a Japanese rat, how Communist cadres spied
for the British secret police on Socialists and Forward Blocists who had
organised an underground movement, and how the Communist intellectuals
like Adhikari and Ashraf blueprinted the case for Pakistan with facts,
figures, academic arguments and sentimental slogans.</p>
<p>The Communist contribution towards the creation of Pakistan was next
only to that of the Muslim League. The Soviet Union was in search of a
base from which it could operate for capturing the rest of India after
the departure of the British. That plan did not succeed and Pakistan
became a base for American interventionism instead. Ever since, the
Communists in India have been blaming the Partition on those very forces
of <em>positive</em> nationalism which had fought the Muslim League tooth and
nail. Communist slogans may change but their hostility to positive
nationalism is permanent.</p>
<p>The source of <em>positive</em> nationalism in India is <em>Sanãtana Dharma</em> and
the long saga of Hindu history. Hindu society provides the only base for
<em>positive</em> nationalism. The Muslim and the Christian communities can
share in <em>positive</em> nationalism only by revising the premises of their
exclusive creeds in favour of the universal principles laid down by
<em>Sanãtana Dharma</em>. Communism in India is bent upon destroying <em>Sanãtana
Dharma</em> and Hindu society. It is, therefore, in its interest to prevent
the Muslims and the Christians from moving towards the mainstream of
<em>positive</em> nationalism. This is a point with which we shall deal when we
expose the united front between various forces hostile to the Hindus.
Here we shall simply specify some prime targets of Communism in its
battle against Hindu society and culture. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The first and foremost target of Communism is <em>Sanãtana Dharma</em>
enshrined in Hindu literature and made living by a long line of
saints, mystics and <em>bhaktas</em>. Communism ridicules all this wealth of
unrivalled spiritual splendour as a conglomeration of sterile
superstition, obnoxious obscurantism and puerile priescraft;</p>
<p>2. Next, Communism makes an aggressive move towards Hindu
<em>Dharmashãstras</em> which have their source in <em>Sanãtana Dharma</em> and
which lay down the moral and social principles by which a wholesome
social and individual life is sustained. Communism denounces these
<em>Dharmashãstras</em> as respositories of primitive prescriptions,
Machiavellian morality, caste oppression, untouchability, degradation
of women, Brahmin domination, lack of social responsibility, and what
not;</p>
<p>3. Thirdly, Communism concentrates on Hindu philosophies which
expound, compare, contrast, fortify and defend the manifold
metaphysical points of view flowing into several streams from the
self-same <em>Sanãtana Dharma</em>. It condemns all these philosophies as
Brahminical conspiracies to suppress the <em>Lokãyata</em>, “the only
scientific philosophy pulsating with a revolutionary principle”. Rahul
Sankrityayana was a great pedlar of this Communist lore among the
Hindi reading public. Some of his works have been translated into
other languages also. He was very enterprising indeed. He postulated
that the Buddha was preaching Marxism for all practical purposes
except for his unmindful lapse into the unproved doctrine of
transmigration;</p>
<p>4. Fourthly-and here Communism has really invested some herculean
endeavours-it ransacks the annals of Hindu history and Hindu heroism.
A whole battalion of Communist historians have been busy for years
battering the walls of Hindu historiography “behind which Hindu
communalism and chauvinism is hiding its ugly face”. They have
ridiculed every hero, every period, every episode, and every precedent
in which Hindus can take pride. The Golden Age of the Imperial Guptas
in which Hindu achievements attained their acme in the fields of art,
literature and science is dismissed as a myth by D.N. Jha whose
<em>Ancient India: An Introductory Outline</em> has just been reprinted by
the People’s Publishing House, New Delhi. Other Communist historians
have portrayed Maharana Pratap, Shivaji and Guru Govind Singh as local
rebels against <em>pax moslemanica</em> for petty personal ends. The same
historians whitewash bloodthirsty Islamic conquerors and despicable
despots, and condone their crimes either by balancing them with “great
good deeds which they did in some other direction” or by explaining
them away as conforming to the prevailing pattern of empire-building;</p>
<p>5. Lastly, the Communist anthropologists and sociologists dive deep
into Hindu social institutions, customs, mores and manners and come up
with some class interest hiding inside the core in each case. We are
told that Hindu society has always been an unhealthy society except
perhaps during the Vedic period when, according to Romila Thapar, our
Aryan ancestors ate beef. Beef-eating by the ancient Aryans has been
such an obsession with Miss Thapar that she returns to the theme again
and again, even when discussing the dancing girl found in the ruins of
Mohenjo-daro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How hostile Communism can be to everything Hindu is proved by an
incident in which S.A. Dange and his son-in-law, Deshpande, got involved
a few years ago. Deshpande wrote quite a scholarly book in which he
propounded that several important principles of modern mathematics and
science (including dialectical materialism which is the greatest
principle of modern science according to Communism) were first
discovered by systems of Hindu philosophy, notably <em>SãMkhya</em> and
<em>Vedãnta</em>. Several other Communist savants had earlier indulged in a
similar exercise of casting ancient Hindu philosophies into a
materialist mould. The party had paraded them as expert explorers and
authentic interpreters of the revolutionary undercurrents in India’s
philosophical heritage. Where Deshpande went wrong was that he took a
genuine pride in the ancient Hindu past and expressed it in no mean
measure. Dange himself contributed a Preface to the book and presented
it as quite an academic achievement. Little did they know the
consequences of what they had done. The Party came down upon them like a
ton of bricks. It called a seminar, “Marxism on Vedanta”, in which Dange
had to confess his errors and cat crow.  Deshpande’s book published by a
society in Bombay was withdrawn from circulation.</p>
<p>The methods which Communism employs in India to denigrate and denounce
the votaries of positive nationalism are the standard Communist methods
it uses everywhere around the world. Here we shall concretise three of
its chief methods under Indian conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Communism in India has developed a language which George Orwell
has described as <em>doublespeak</em>. In this language, the traitorous and
totalitarian forces represented by the Communist movement are
presented as <em>patriotic</em> and democratic forces, collaborators
with Communism as progressive people, Islamic imperialism as
secularism, and positive nationalism as Hindu communalism and
chauvinism. Many people do not know how to decipher this <em>doublespeak</em>
and are, therefore, trapped by it;^(<a href="#1">1</a>)</p>
<p>2. Communism in India constantly practises what Karl Popper so aptly
expounded “as the conspiracy theory of society”. It goes on digging up
one conspiracy after another against the working class, the peasantry,
the middle class, the toiling masses, Secularism, and so on. In this
scheme, it links up “Hindu communalism and chauvinism” with
capitalism, landlordism, forces of obscurantism, revivalism and
reaction and, finally, all of them with “American imperialism”. The
forces of “democracy and progress” are then called upon to rally round
the Communist movement to defeat the “grand conspiracy between
American imperialism outside and reactionary Hindu communalism
within”. This helps the Communist cadres to acquire a rare depth of
perception without exercising their brains. The less they know and
think, the better they feel and function.  Recently, Communism has
discovered a conspiracy of “Hindu communalism” to kill Muslims and
destroy Muslim property whenever and wherever Muslims show some signs
of prosperity;</p>
<p>3. Communism in India wields a strong-worded swearology which it
hurls at its adversaries. Some samples of this swearology will
illumine the venom which it can carry. During the Ranadive party-line
in 1948-50, Mahatma Gandhi was “unmasked” as the cleverest bourgeois
scoundrel and Rabindranath as <em>mãgeer dãlãl</em>, that is, a pimp. But the
choicest reprimand was reserved for Sardar Patel and Pandit Nehru “the
fascist duo”. <em>Parichaya</em>, the prestigious Bengali monthly, came out
with a long poem on the two of them “conspiring together in the
service of American imperialism”. One of the lines exposed them as
<em>shyãlã shooarer bãcchã, birlã tatãr jãroja shontãna</em>, that is, sons
of swine and the bastard progeny of Birlas and Tatas. But, then, you
cannot pin the Communists to any of their past performances. They
always “admit their mistakes” publicly and do a bit of chest-beating
whenever they receive orders to change the Party line. At present, the
bulk of Communist swearology is being mobilised against the camp of
positive nationalism. People belonging to this camp are being daily
denounced as communalists, chauvinists, fascist murderers of
minorities, perpetrators of genocide, reactionaries and
revivalists. The tone is still mild, keeping in mind how mendacious it
could easily become at a moment’s notice. But there are intimations
that it may resume its full powers of rhetoric as and when
required.^(<a href="#2">2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hindu society is basically a sane society which can smile with tolerance
at every variety of venomous as well as tall talk. Hindus could have
dismissed the Communists as a band of lunatics and morons, had not
Communism acquired the power and prestige it enjoys in India today.
Communism has, of course, fattened itself on widespread Macaulayism and
a <em>negative</em> nationalism driven by nothing better than an anti-Western
animus and inflated ideas about India’s role in world affairs. But the
main strength of Communism in India springs from colossal Soviet
finances which pour into its coffers through many channels and in
increasing amounts. This is not the place to identify the channels
through which the Soviet Union finances its fifth-column in India. Here
we are concerned with what the Communist movement does with this money.
The following deserve our particular attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Communist movement in India has built up the largest press in
English as well as Indian languages. It runs many dailies, weeklies,
fortnightlies, monthlies, quarterlies and irregular periodicals. Most
of these papers and journals do not care for commercial and other
advertisements which are the main source of income in normal press
establishments. The losses that are incurred by these party organs run
into crores of rupees every year,</p>
<p>2. The movement controls the largest number of publishing houses.
They publish Communist literature in English as well as Indian
languages. Most of this literature is in the form of pamphlets,
presenting the Party line on all issues of importance, national and
international. Recently, Communist publishing houses have undertaken
publication of heavier intellectual fare as well, provided it carries
a Communist slant or is authored by a Communist or a fellow-traveller.
A new line is publication of text-books, particularly on Indian
history. These are prescribed by Communist professors whenever and
wherever they control university departments, which is not unoften.
Departments of history in the Delhi and Jawaharlal Nehru universities,
for instance, have become pocket boroughs of Communism for all
practical purposes. All this literature, light as well as heavy, is
sold at prices which cannot meet even a fraction of the cost. The
large discounts allowed to retailers increase this disparity a good
deal. The publishing houses which are housed in spacious places, owned
or rented by the movement, maintain large salaried staff of all
levels. The losses incurred in this enterprise are also colossal;</p>
<p>3. The movement is a cadre-based movement. It has a farflung
hierarchy of leaders and workers. All of them are paid activists. Some
of them are whole-timers, others part-timers. The leaders are paid and
maintained much better than the workers. But salaries and allowances
of workers are not inadequate either, if we take into account the
communes which the movement maintains for its activists. These
expenses on salaries, rents, food, clothing, transport and sundries
account for another colossal sum spent from month to month and year
after year;</p>
<p>4. The movement maintains and mans many front organisations among
trade unions, peasantry, students, youth, women, children, writers,
artists, for “peace”, for fighting “imperialism”, for opposing
“communalism”. Most of these front organisations have their own
offices and their own staff. They also publish their own pamphlets and
periodicals. The costs involved on maintaining and turning these
transmission belts, as Lenin called them, are considerable;</p>
<p>5. The Communist movement in India is well-known for the frequency of
conferences, congresses, mass meetings and demonstrations. A large
number of people, many times from long distances, are paid to travel
to these gatherings, pass the Party resolutions and shout the Party
slogans. Many participants in Communist demonstrations, particularly
in big cities like Calcutta, are hired on the basis of payment per
head per day. The lodging, board and transport costs for mobilising
these crowds are paid by the movement. Posters, placards and buntings
abound on these occasions. Again, the costs are colossal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not counting the routine expenses which every political movement
or party has to incur in its normal functioning. The parties which do
not control a government know it very well how difficult it is to find
finances even for these normal expenses. The expenses incurred by the
Communist movement are abnormal when compared to its size and
significance in India’s body-politic. In comparison, the ruling Congress
Party is a poor party. And it has to find itself in an embarassing
position when some of its methods for collecting money are exposed.</p>
<p>The one thing which, next to slogans, never gets scarce in the Communist
movement is money. That is how it is always in a position to prove that
it is a movement of the poor, maintained by the poor, and for the
benefit of the poor. Shankar had once drawn a cartoon in which a
well-dressed upper class Communist worker was demanding a donation for
peace from a naked and blind beggar, and denouncing the latter as a
warmongering agent of American imperialism who would not part with his
paisa.</p>

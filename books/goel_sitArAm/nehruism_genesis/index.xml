      <description>FOREWORD BY PHILIP SPRATT
Why is there so much puzzlement about the politics of Jawaharlal Nehru? As Goel reminds us, and every newspaper reader can recall, he himself frequently says that he agrees in principle with the Communists. Why is he not taken at his word?
We do not take him at his word, because he says and does many other things, and so we do not realise how closely the relevant parts of his policy accord with this particular avowal.</description>

      <description>FIRST PREFACE
The eighteen chapters of this book appeared originally as eighteen installments of a series written by &amp;lsquo;Ekaki&amp;rsquo; in the weekly Organiser, New Delhi, from June 5 to October 9, 1961. The nineteenth chapter, Choosing Between USA And USSR, was contributed by me to the Diwali 1962 issue of the Organiser which came out soon after the first wave of Chinese invasion on October 20, 1962. They have been reprinted with a few minor changes here and there.</description>

      <description>SECOND PREFACE
This book is a reprint with minor changes, mostly in language, of an old one published from New Delhi in December 1963 under the title &amp;lsquo;In Defence of Comrade Krishna Menon&amp;rsquo;. That book, in turn, was compilation of a series of my articles which appeared under the same general title in the New Delhi weekly, Oganiser, from October 1961 to October 1962. The book carried a Foreword and a Preface as well.</description>

      <description>ONE
IN SEARCH OF A CULPRIT
The communist and fellow-travelling press and platforms in this country are busy building up and defending India&amp;rsquo;s Defence Minister, Mr. V.K. Krishna Menon, in the face of what the leftists describe as &amp;ldquo;an upsurge of rightist reaction&amp;rdquo;. Krishna Menon himself struts about with an air of injured innocence, and frequently dons the mask of a much misunderstood martyr whose services to the nation have not been properly appreciated.</description>

      <description>TWO
A PILGRIM TO THE SOVIET PARADISE
The first job is to find out how Pandit Nehru has looked at the Soviet Union and the creed of Communism all through these years. For purposes of this investigation we have chosen five basic books written by him, namely Soviet Russia (1929), Glimpses of World History (1934), An Autobiography (1936), Unity of India (1941), and Discovery of India (1946). All these books, except the first and the fourth, have been reprinted many times and still constitute the basic reading for anyone who wants to understand Pandit Nehru.</description>

      <description>THREE
HISTORIAN WITH COMMUNIST GLASSES
Pandit Nehru&amp;rsquo;s second book, Glimpses of World History, was first published in India in 1934 and later on in England in 1939. The second edition which was &amp;ldquo;revised and, to a considerable extent, rewritten&amp;rdquo;, carried a foreword from Krishna Menon who was mainly responsible for getting it published in England. Krishna Menon says: &amp;ldquo;Glimpses of World History is no mere narrative of events, valuable as the work is in this respect, but also a reflection of the author&amp;rsquo;s personality.</description>

      <description>FOUR
AN INDEFATIGABLE SOVIET ENTHUSIAST
We have seen in the foregoing chapter that Pandit Nehru held up the &amp;ldquo;Soviet experiment&amp;rdquo; up to 1934 as being of special interest to India because-in his opinion &amp;ldquo;conditions in this country [India] are very much the same as in Russia before the Revolution&amp;rdquo;. What were the similarities? First of all, Russia before the Revolution was a backward country as India was in 1934. Secondly, Russia before the Revolution had a huge language and minorities problem, the same as we had in India in 1934.</description>

      <description>FIVE
AN INCURABLE SOVIET-ADDICT
If we contemplate the several varieties of Soviet-addicts, we can classify them into three clear-cut categories.
In the first place, we have those dupes who believe that all the dreams which mankind has ever dreamt have become physical reality inside the Soviet Union. These people can talk and write endlessly about the miracles that have materialised in Soviet society. But no one can ever involve them into a discussion based on known facts.</description>

      <description>SIX
AN APOLOGIST FOR SOVIET SINS
An ordinary apologist for Soviet sins always points out the &amp;ldquo;progressive character of Soviet foreign policy&amp;rdquo; whenever he is faced with an overwhelming evidence of Soviet crimes in the domestic sphere. And he generally turns towards &amp;ldquo;Soviet achievements at home&amp;rdquo; whenever he finds that a defence of Soviet foreign policy at some point is a somewhat more difficult job. But Pandit Nehru is no ordinary apologist.</description>

      <description>SEVEN
A PERSISTENT PRO-SOVIET SPEAKER
Pandit Nehru&amp;rsquo;s admirers are prepared to admit that he was influenced by communist thought to quite an extent before he became the first Prime Minister of independent India in August 1947. But they maintain (of course, in a purely a priory fashion) that since that event his sense of responsibility as leader of a major democracy has considerably diluted his devotion to purely theoretical questions, and developed in him a sense of proportion regarding the Soviet Union.</description>

A DEVOTED DISCIPLE OF STALIN
The question may be asked that if Pandit Nehru was not very important in the Congress organisation so long as Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel were alive, how did he come to dominate the organisation within a very short time after Sardar&amp;rsquo;s death, and to swing the country fast towards his Soviet Fatherland. An answer to this question needs an analysis of the character of our nationalism during our struggle with British imperialism.</description>

The Gita has laid down a profound principle in the following words: &amp;ldquo;The person is characterised by his credo. Whatever is a person&amp;rsquo;s credo, that he is.&amp;rdquo;
And a person&amp;rsquo;s credo can be identified not so much in the words he speaks or writes as in the actions that flow freely out of him. The speaker or the writer who fails to act in terms of the faith he propounds in his speeches and writings is no more than a sophist who may be successful with some people or for some time but who is sure to be found out sooner or later.</description>

Ever since Pandit Nehru visited the United States of America for the first time in 1949 and the U.S. Administration discovered that it was impossible to have a free and frank discussion with him regarding concrete policies, a horde of U.S. specialists and psychologists have been in and out of India for a &amp;ldquo;fuller understanding of Jawaharlal Nehru, India&amp;rsquo;s man of destiny&amp;rdquo;. They have studied his life story exhaustively and brooded for years over his least little idiosyncrasy.</description>

An year or so before Sardar Patel&amp;rsquo;s death in December 1950, there was a serious rift between him and Prime Minister Nehru on questions concerning the foreign policy of India. The Sardar did not like the way in which our foreign affairs were being conducted. He felt that our foreign policy was too servile to the Soviet camp in spite of the violent hostility which that camp had all along shown towards the Government of independent India.</description>

Shri D.G. Mohan Rao, a friend from Warrangal, who has been reading this series, writes: &amp;ldquo;There is confusion to know exactly what is Ekaki&amp;rsquo;s name to write about either Shri Nehru or Krishna Menon. Ekaki collected only the &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; quotations of him-Nehru. But Nehru tells sometimes &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; also about communists. The theory and the way of collecting only &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; quotations in Nehru&amp;rsquo;s praise of communism does not underline the psychology in perfect way because there are so many other &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; quotations also in Shri Nehru&amp;rsquo;s warnings against communists.</description>

Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru have always been associated in our intelligentsia&amp;rsquo;s mind as leftists and socialists who are supposed to have stood for the same sort of ideals during the days of our struggle against foreign rule or at least upto 1939 when Bose was ousted from the Indian National Congress by &amp;ldquo;Sardar Patel&amp;rsquo;s rightist clique&amp;rdquo;. The intelligentsia is also aware that at no time did Pandit Nehru have a soft corner for Bose whom he increasingly came to suspect as a sympathiser of Fascism and Nazism.</description>

The main plank of Congress propaganda after independence has been that it drove out the British by means of non-violent non-cooperation and brought freedom to the country. The Congress refers with particular pride to the policies it pursued during the Second World War period, particularly after the Quit India Resolution was passed in Bombay in August 1942. To put it simply, we are asked to believe that British imperialism in India got frightened because some Congressmen in some parts of the country pulled down some telephone poles and broke a number of letter-boxes before they were herded into British jails.</description>

Hitler got defeated in the Second World War. Therefore, everyone can now shout: &amp;ldquo;Hell, thy name is Hitler.&amp;rdquo; So if anyone says today that at least in so far as Hider&amp;rsquo;s relations with the Soviet Union were concerned after Molotov signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Ribbentrop in August 1939, his record was absolutely unimpeachable, he should be committing the most horrible crime. For, the Soviet Union won the War along with her Western allies.</description>

As I draw towards the end of this series, I have a second letter saying that I have not at all succeeded in establishing my case about Prime Minister Nehru&amp;rsquo;s communist leanings. Mr. Tolo Panjabi from Bombay thinks that the &amp;ldquo;tone and trend&amp;rdquo; of my arguments is &amp;ldquo;most regrettable and deliberately misleading&amp;rdquo;, and that my description of Fascism as the &amp;ldquo;last-ditch battle of nationalism against communism&amp;rdquo; shows where my &amp;ldquo;sympathies are&amp;rdquo;.</description>

When the Soviet Union denounced Pandit Nehru in 1948 as a puppet whom &amp;ldquo;American imperialism&amp;rdquo; was trying to prop up in place of the old &amp;ldquo;paper tiger&amp;rdquo;, President Chiang Kai-shek of China, the Western nations, particularly the United States of America, had proclaimed immediately that Pandit Nehru was the &amp;ldquo;bulwark of democracy in Asia&amp;rdquo;. But the Korean War was hardly half through when it was widely realised in the West that at least in the field of international politics Pandit Nehru was no friend of the West, and that his sympathies, whenever and wherever they became manifest, were always and all along with the communist camp.</description>

SAPPERS AND MINERS OF COMMUNISM
An ideology can be taken to have triumphed when those whom it declares to be its enemies start speaking its language. Communism has already passed that test and arrived at a stage when its thought-categories have acquired an almost universal adherence. Let us sample some of the more basic communist slogans and see how strongly and systematically they have seeped into the thought and language of the present-day intelligentsia in every corner of the world.</description>

CHOOSING BETWEEN USA AND USSR1
Communist China&amp;rsquo;s aggression along our Himalayan frontier has once again posed before the nation the problem of finding friends against foes in a dangerous and divided world. The nation had faced this problem at first when Pakistan signed a military pact with the United States of America, and started talking tough in the context of her self-chosen controversy over Kashmir. During those days, at least, it was seriously apprehended by the Indian people at large that Pakistan might mount an aggression against India from a position of superior military strength.</description>

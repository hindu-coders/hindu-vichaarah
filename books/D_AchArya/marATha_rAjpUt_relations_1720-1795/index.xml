      <description>(1) Rajasthan - Physiography (1) :
Rajasthan comprises the area between 23rd degree to 30th degree North latitude and 68th degree to 78th East longitude. The earliest reference to Rajasthan is in connection with its agidity. The word Maru is found in Rugwed the Mahabharat (Vanaparva, 201.41) and Brahatsamhita.
Aravalli range runs through Rajasthan, northeast to southwest, for about 430 miles, starting from Delhi (known as Delhi ridge) and extending to Ahmadabad.</description>

(i) The Marathas, The Rajputs and The Nizam :
The factions at the Court of Delhi after the death of Aurangzeb, especially from the beginning of the reign of Farrukh Siyar till 1720 A.D., made the Emperor a puppet in the hands of either the Sayyad brothers or the Nizam who was the head of the Turani party.</description>

There existed nothing but cordial relations between the Rajputs and the Maratha till 1743 A.D., but within less than 10 years, the former turned into the most bitter enemies of the latter and conspired with Najib Khan Rohilla and the Durani Chief Ahmad Shah Abdali for their destruction. And even though this enmity turned into a friendship for a temporary period of a few years during 1764 to 1769 A.</description>

      <description>THE INEVITABLE With the exit of the Jat power under Nawalsing, after its rout at Gowardhan (5th of April 1770 A.D.) at the hands of the Marahtas, from the politics of Delhi and with the entry of Mahadaji as Vakil-ul-Mutlak (November 1784 A.D.) subsequent to the treaty of Salbye with the English, the Maratha-Rajput relations entered into the last phase of severe contest in which both sides, disregarding that they belonged to the same religion, culture and land, fought with the determination to annihilate each other.</description>

      <description>(1) Maharashtra Physiography :
Besides being simple and honest in their habits, Maharashtrians from ancient times (1) have always been brave warrior sufficiently hardy to meet any challenge and tenacious to hold on inspite of unspeakable hardships. That has been their nature for which to a greater extent, the physical conditions of the country are responsible.
&amp;ldquo;The characteristic features (2) of the Maharashtra country are the great mountain ranges which enclose it on two sides, the Sahyadri range running from north to south, and the Satpura and Vindhya ranges running from east to west, The minor ranges, which break out in rugged outline from these mountain Chains and from the watersheds of many rivers which fall ultimately into the Godavari and into the Krishna, give the whole country an appearance ruggedness and unevenness not to be met with in other parts of India on such a scale.</description>

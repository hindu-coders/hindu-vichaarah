      <description>On May 5, 1984 Jain temple in Amritsar was looted and desecrated. Because the Jains are a very affluent community, Jain temples were seen by radicals as a great source for loot.
On February 28 of the same year, another Jain temple was looted.</description>

      <description>Brahmins were a favorite target of Khalistani activists. Bhindranwale&amp;rsquo;s rhetoric frequently centred on anti Brahmanism.
On 25th June 1983, a Pujari of a temple in Sultanpur was kiIIed with a sharp knife. While attacks on Hindu places of worship have abated in Punjab, thanks to the anti militancy drives of police and army, they are not completely a thing of past.
In 2020, a Hindu priest was warned and shot at.</description>

      <description>Radicals desecrated Ram Lila. May 31 1988 They bombed Hindu fairs like Shivaratri &amp;amp; Ramnavami where Hindus gathered in large numbers to ensure maximum Hindu kiIIings. In 1980s and 1990s, not everybody in Punjab had television sets. People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals.</description>

      <description>Hinduism is a minority religion in Punjab. During the Khalistan movement, the minority Hindus and Jains were subjected to several attacks. Hindu and Jain temples were frequently vandalized and desecrated. This thread documents a few instances.
It is to be noted that many of these incidents happened prior to the Operation Blue Star carried out by Congress Government in 1984. The attacks of Hindu temples were not confined to just Punjab.</description>

      <description>Axiomatic differences  &amp;ldquo;Despite English leaving almost 7 decades ago most H remain are unable to think independently of occidental axioms: Hence,they live in a world where many H manifestations remain difficult to understand. They have also never take the time to question if the occidental axioms are the correct 1s to use in a description of their own world: much like describing a Riemannian world with Euclidean axioms.&amp;rdquo;  Occidental imposition It is an old Euro-american habit to superimpose their fancies on foreign cultures in reaction to their terrible internal problems.</description>

      <description>Vishvaguru attitude is a type of arrogance.
This attitude lurks whenever you hear, these type of statements: &amp;ldquo;veda-s have everything; there is nothing the mlecCha-s have to offer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;rAmAyaNa period we had flying machine, mahAbhArata time we had cloning and nuclear weapons&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;there is no problem with hinduism; it suffices to just follow the shAstra&amp;rdquo;.
Occurance elsewhere That&amp;rsquo;s something shared by late mideval China, and recently by western liberal democrats. Contrast with Japan - she&amp;rsquo;s a student culture - selectively and carefully picked and learned from Indians, Chinese, Dutch, Americans - no &amp;ldquo;know it all&amp;rdquo; attitude.</description>

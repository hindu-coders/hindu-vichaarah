      <description>The situation: the rapidly increasing proportion of Abrahamists in India (and more broadly, worldwide), leading to Hindu composition falling below the 50% mark at least before 2100 (see GS) if we fail to respond. How should hindus respond? The effect of polygamy  &amp;ldquo;In other words, the more sister-wives a Mormon woman had, the fewer children she was likely to produce.&amp;rdquo; (G).   Some claim: “Religion will be a lot less important in the future (50 years from now)”.</description>

Potential weaknesses  Racial admixture in our population makes it harder for us to be ruthless, since the inimical population and their backers look like us.  Motivating studies:  Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental simulation of actions during observation of outgroups. [pdf]   Contrast with the homogenous Chinese and Japanese. Their homogeneity makes it easy for them to view converts as a fifth column of aliens and be ruthless.</description>

      <description> Bishnois don&amp;rsquo;t cut down trees or kill animals (PJ, FV), they don&amp;rsquo;t let in outsiders into their villages (especially muslims). They have high TFR (anecdotes).  This can be contrasted by some brahmanas selling agrahara lands to muslims for money in TN (who overpay to get a foothold - via ravilochanan).   sindhi and gujarAti traders are spread through out the world.  </description>

## Altaic, Turkik lordship
### IE invasions
- "Indo-Europeans reached and probably overwhelmed the Eastern Steppes starting first around 5300 YBP symmetrically with the first invasion of western Europe. This eastern branch perhaps gave rise to the Tocharians though more data from the time Tocharian was actually attested would be useful. ... While the Afanasievo people who represent the 1st IE invasion of the east did not mix noticeably with the east Asians."
- "However, a second wave of Indo-Europeans, the Indo-Iranians, started advancing east perhaps starting around 4100 YBP. They appear to have conquered the Kazakh steppes by around 4000 YBP& sometime in the following 500 years invaded India: Aryan invasion."
- "By sometime around 3200-2900 YBP a branch of the Aryans advanced deeply to the east. ...This new Indo-Iranian wave mixed with the East Asians in Mongolia... This gene flow was not very extensive in the eastern reaches but it brought the technology of horse+goat+sheep+cow diary pastoralism to the east. This appears to have been transferred without much genetic acquisition of the lactase persistence phenotype."

### shakas and kuShANa-s
- shAka-s (scythian-s) and kuShANa-s, early masters of horseback warfare at the end of chariot era, displaced by admixed huNa-s.
    - shaka-s included women warriors who might have inspired Amazon stories, interbred with mongols. Eg. Eastern shAka-s in Altai - [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2981&v=Wg5IHN5t1X8).
- "The invention of the stirrup itself remains murky – it is first seen in India and then in the steppes, yet the first major users of equestrian warfare were the steppe Indo-Iranians like the Shakas and Kushanas. It was from them that it was transmitted to the first Altaic people who became known to the world as the Huns under Motun Tegin, and the Kushanas themselves became the first victims of the Huns. " {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}

#### Religion and rituals
- "Darius clearly states that these shaka-s were not Zoroastrians; likely that they followed an Iranian religion closer to ancestral state", though some of them had Iranic influences. \[[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/701458711823384576)\]
- Ritual transmission from shaka-s to the japanese after 250-300 CE  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/some-reflections-on-the-khans-qaidu-and-dua-and-the-great-khans-lost-legacy/)\]
    - Clues:
        - \[[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/701265292618555395)\] Introduction of horse, with shaka tigrakauda hat/dress.
        - ancient mirror used in sun-worship by the Shakas.

### huNa-s

#### Chu dynasty in china
" The Chu Ci or the poetry of the Chu kingdom which has works going back 300 BCE is of great interest in this regard. The ruling clan of the Chu kingdom is supposed to have been one of outsiders coming from the northwest, who took over the custody of this chIna kingdom. They are described as being characterized by a distinctive shamanistic practice involving a fire ritual. The medieval chIna scholar Shen Kuo (1031–1095 CE) made a remarkable observation. In his study of an ancient Chu incantation, known as the Zhao Hun, he noted that a word that comes frequently as the end of the formula pronounced in the Chu language as ‘sai’ corresponded to svAhA in Sanskrit (“sa po he” in Chinese). A Chu poem Tian Wen has also been proposed to bear parallels to verses in the veda and the avesta. The maternal ancestress of the Chu are described by chIna chronicles as being of the Guifang clan. The chIna historians state that they were a clan of the Central Asian pastoralist raiders known as the Xiongnu or Hunyu, who were the Huns of history. The paternal ancestor of the Chu ruling clan is said to be emperor Zhuan Xu. His grandsons Zhongli and Wuhui are supposed to have become Chu ritualist-ministers called the “Officer of Fire” with the title Zhurong (In later chIna parlance apparently Zhu Rong is the name of the fire deity). The chIna text termed Zhou Li (Rituals of Zhou) from around 500 BCE records the duties of such an “Officer of Fire”, named Si Quan, which have no parallels elsewhere in the Han chIna world. He is supposed to issue orders for fire rituals, kindle the new fire at the beginning of each of the four seasons, conduct fire worship with oblations, and maintain the “fire seed” or original fire for the state. These are remarkably parallel to the Indo-Iranian ritual tradition. This when taken together with an observation made by Zhang He appears to be a clincher in this regard. The chIna-s currently term the holy soma plant (Ephedra species) huang ma or ma huang which is taken to mean yellow (huang) ma (hemp). Now the yellowness is indeed a feature of the plant that the Indo-Aryans and Iranians emphasize (hari and zairi)." {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}


#### Ritual motifs
- from IE to huNa-s and others
    - horse + fire rituals and soma allusions spanning Chu dynasty to chingIz khAn. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/some-reflections-on-the-khans-qaidu-and-dua-and-the-great-khans-lost-legacy/)\]
- altaic devI umAi brought to India by the kushAna-s.

#### Genetics:
- " Among the people whose DNA was recovered from the Hun cemetery in Duurlig Nars, Northeast Mongolia (~20-0 BCE), there was one with the typical Indo-Iranian R1a1 Y-chromosome alongside others with North-East Asian markers." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/some-reflections-on-the-khans-qaidu-and-dua-and-the-great-khans-lost-legacy/)\] 

### alan-s and tocharians 
- alan-s / Aryan-s -> Ossetians
- Tocharians -> uighur turks
- Nature of the interaction
    - "Various steppe powers controlled the border of the steppe-land and the settled zone. When previous steppe powers penetrated deep into settled civilizational centers they either had to give up their steppe centers or at best conduct some raids and retreat to their steppe-land domain. Those groups that did establish themselves in the non-steppe zone essentially gave up their connection to the steppe-land even if they reproduced many aspects of it in their new homelands. This is poignantly seen in the early Indo-European peoples including our own Aryan ancestors who settled in India. The later waves of their successors like the Śaka-s and subsequently groups like the Huns also fall into the above pattern. The only possible exception were the Kuṣāṇa-s who did achieve something like what the Chingizid Mongols did albeit on a clearly smaller scale. Importantly, they could not hold their original steppe centers close to Mongolia, which they lost to the Altaic peoples. Further, they could bridge their successes in the eastern and western steppes and India into a completely stable coherent unit only for a brief period. In contrast, with Chingiz Khan and his great successors we see a program for the complete conquest and control of civilizational centers of the settled world into a system of rule from the steppe." 
- Tocharians and shaka-s -> uighur (with significant genetic input)

### Later hunnic khAnates
- shanyu hunnic khAnate \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]
- Rouran Khanate
- Tuguhun khanate
    - "Hunnic Mongols led by their Kha’Khan Tuguhun established the eponymous kingdom in central Asia (called Azha by the Tibetans). He conquered the Tarim region and extended his sway in direction of Kashgar, taking Khotan in the south and part of what is now Kyrgyzstan. He was what one might call a lesser, proto-version of Chingiz Kha’Khan – he re-organized the administration, introduced a written script for the old Mongolian dialect and even introduced agricultural sectors in his kingdom which complemented the pastoral lifestyle of his peoples. "

### Turkik khanates
- [Kök Türük (Gök Türk = Blue Turk)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)
    - "However, legacy of the Blue Turks was lasting one- it gave the Turks the the concept of a nation, ethnic identity and made them into a civilizational influence. This  was also influenced the Mongols who had made similar earlier attempts at nationhoods in founding the two great Hunnic Khanates \[commonly termed the Xiongnu and Rouran or Juan-Juan Khanates\]. .. Their rise for the Turks was as momentous as the rise of the Bharatas amidst the Indo-Aryans. ... However, it had not sunk deep enough for the transformation of the entire Altaic people. Here lie the roots of modern Turkey and the Central Asian Stans’  identity crisis  which was hijacked by the desert delusion in the centuries to come. "  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)\]

### Mongols rise
- khiTan, Chingizid Menggu/Mengwu/ Mongol tribe. The great chingiz khAn (family tree [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Genghis_Khan)) conquered and started the empire.
    - Thence emerged:
        - The Golden horde/ Ulus of Jochi towards Russia, which after Öz Beg Khan declined due to internal conflict and Islamicized.
        - Tolui's yuan dynasty came from his Nestorian Christian wife Sorghaghtani Beki.
        - Hulagu-yn Ulus/ Ilkhanate accross Iran, Iraq etc..
            - " Il-Khans had conquered Mesopotamia after annihilating the Shi’a power of the Hashishins and the Sunni Kilafat. So the Mohammedans were no longer a political force in Mesopotamia. Yet they were able to destroy the external influences and re-establish the Shari’a." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
            - "Due to the Mohammedan persecution of various groups favored by Arghun he came up with a plan to conquer Mecca and restore heathen worship there with construction of temples of buddhakapAla and heruka, but due to other preoccupations he failed to do so. Indeed, during the Ilkhanid regime multiple temples to buddhakapAla, kAlachakra and hevajra had been built in Baghdad, Tabriz and in some places in the province of Khurasan." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
            -  [Ghazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazan "Ghazan"), shortly before he overthrew [Baydu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baydu "Baydu"), converted to [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam").
        - (Chagatai) Tsagadaina Khaanat Ulus ruled over mughalistaan in Ferghana area - also islamicized.
            - gUrkhAni-s Timur and babur's mogols (displaced by Oirat-s) came thence.
    - Secularism failed here
        - \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]

#### Ritual systems
- “There was a great battle between the demons and the Tengri in which the latter were defeated. They turned to Qormusta Khan Tengri (ahura mazdA), the high god, for aid. He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner). Aided by these deities, the Tengri fought the demons and defeated them.” {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}
- "Chingiz is also said to have formalized other rituals such as those of marriage. Walther Heissig noted that in eastern Mongolia they still recite this history during the pre-marriage ritual: “The fortunate Chingiz Kha’Khan, the incarnation of Qormusta Tengri, at the time when he took to wife Boerte [Footnote 3], the daughter of the Bayan of the Khunggirad tribe, the subject of Ughichud, sent his wise officials, led by the ministers Boghorju and Muqali [Footnote 4] and following the custom of the old, the custom was fulfilled to ask after the name and the year of birth of the bride. He is said to have introduced the ritual of anointing the yurt followed by the worship of the deities of the sun and moon and making offerings to the yurt hearth fire.” The last can be compared to the ritual offering to the gArhapatya fire in the Hindu tradition."
- Late Indo-tibetan influence. {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}
    - Tension with the earlier IA influenced tengri-ism \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)\]
    - "Chingizids of the Qubilaid line might have waned into anonymity had they found a new leader in the form of the direct descendent of Qubilai Khan, Puṇyaśrī Oljei Temür. On one hand Puṇyaśrī was a learned Sanskritist, with literary interests going beyond the vajrayāṇa tantra-s and encompassing the works of Daṇḍin and Bhojadeva Paramāra. On the other he was a vigorous warrior who started rebuilding the Mongol army and drew back the Arans to his side. He repulsed the Ming thrusts into Mongolia and struck out at the Chinese forces in several encounters to the south. ... in 1424 CE the Arans and Puṇyaśrī had a falling out and the latter was killed in the conflict." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/some-notes-on-the-rise-of-oirat-power-and-the-jangar-tuuli/)\]
    - Adoration of the 5th dalAi lAma sonam gyatso by Altan kakhAn, partial suppression of shamanism \[[TW17](https://i.imgur.com/c7LQTfL.jpg)\]
    - Later transmission through the geluk-influenced incarnation of tAranAtha - jJNAnavajra (zanbazar).

## Tungustic
- Jurchen, Jin and Liao empires.
- Yelü Dashi's Qara khiTai, who uncharacteristically resisted conversion to Islam even while ruling over muslim subjects, in contrast with several other turkish and mongol branches. \[[SP16](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/725049903102197761)\] \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]

## Indic islands in the Tarim basin
- "In 615 AD, the 3 Central Asian kingdoms of Kucha, Agni (later Qara Shahar) and Khotan (gosthAna/ oDDiyAna-pITha) were islands of the Indic civilization in the Tarim Basin. They were at the pinnacle of their power and prosperity and were great centers of Sanksritic learning, producing a variety of texts on buddhist and classical hindu philosophies. .. The new king of Kucha, suvarNadeva renewed the non-aggression pact with Tai-tsung, the expansionist Chinese emperor. In all likelihood Hsuen Tsang was also acting as a spy to the emperor and providing him intelligence regarding these Indic Kingdoms. Shortly after Hsuen Tsang passed through this region, Tai-tsung decided to swallow these kingdoms, without much of a warning. ... Thus, the Tarim basin passed from the Indian cultural zone to the yoke of the Chinese. All traces of Indic civilization in this region were subsequently erased with the conquest of this region from the Chinese by the Tibetan hordes, followed by its conquest by the great Uighur Kha’khans of Mongolia." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/24/destruction-of-the-4-central-asian-indic-garrisons/)\]
- "In the period that followed the death of the great emperor lalitAditya, and the confusion during the reign of saMgrAmapIDa, the Chinese generals Yao Yao and Wei-ch’ih-Sheng devised a daring plan to take Khotan. With the help of the internal Sinitic population they engineered a revolt and suddenly appeared at the head of a massive Chinese army of 80,000 to beseige and conqueror the kingdom. First Sheng and there after Yao declared themselves rulers of Khotan. Alarmed at this advance the descendent of lalitAditya, jayAditya, son of saMgrAmapIDa, who ascended the throne in 751 CE, assigned general vijaya vikrama a descendent of the original Hindu royal family of Khotan to wrest it back from the chInas, hUnas and “mlecchas”. ... " The rule of this dynasty continued till ~992, when, isolated, it fell to muslims. {[MT2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/17/a-brief-history-of-the-vijayan-rule-of-khotan/)}

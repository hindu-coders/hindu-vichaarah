## Hākamanshiya empire
- "Although they were around in west Asia for sometime since 1000 BCE, they were not exactly a mighty force. But in the steppe-borderland there were still mighty clans of the Indo-Iranian continuum which had played a major role in the rise of Aryan power in India. Among them were the Kuru and Kamboja and it was perhaps in a confederation of such tribes that the Hākamanshiya arose. Their king the great Kurush (Cyrus), named after Kuru, established a great world empire stretching from the eastern reaches of Soghdiana to the western end of Asia Minor sometime between 600-530 BCE. He conquered in succession his Iranian cousins the Medians, the Lydians, who were relatives of the Hittites, and the Babylonians and their vassals, besieging and taking fortified strongholds one after the other like no one had ever before done in West Asia. Finally, while fighting the Śaka-Hindu alliance that was arrayed against him with their elephant force during his invasion of Śakastana, a Hindu spearman stabbed Kurush in the liver resulting in his death." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-i/)\]
- "His son was Kambūjiya (Cambyses) named after the old Kamboja mentioned in our national epic. He led a great force for the conquest of Egypt, which was one of the last major powers left in the region that plainly refused to acknowledge the might of the Iranians.  … The Iranians then quickly took the fort and captured the pharaoh Psamtik. His life was initially spared but as he tried to revolt and regain his kingdom Kambūjiya killed him and even carved a seal depicting him spearing the pharaoh." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-i/)\]

## The fall
- "Shāh Koshrau-II led a brilliant campaign against the Abrahamistic alliance of the Byzantine Christians and the Khazar Turks, winning a string of victories against them. He even managed to get the heathen powers of the Slavs and the Avar Khaghanate over to his side against the Abrahamistic alliance and by 622 CE the it looked as though the Iranian empire was poised at a high-point, recovering the old Hākamanashiya glory. The śula of the preta was brought down in Jerusalem and even Egypt was reconquered by the Iranians. But the empire had serious cracks within. Thus, when the Abrahamistic alliance launched its holy war demolishing key Zoroastrian temples and the epidemic of the third Abrahamism erupted from within it crumbled and Iranian civilization itself became extinct – for what do a band of Parsis matter when your land is gone?" \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-i/)\]

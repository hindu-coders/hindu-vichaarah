- A sibling of the Arya deva-dharma, a child of the ancestral Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-Aryan. They shared several deva-s with the Arya-s.

## deva-s
- "From the fragments of the pre-Achaemenid Medians and Persians, and also to certain extant the later Parthians and shAkas we observe that the system based on the worship of the Aditya-s (though they are never called that) was the dominant one. Especially, mitra, varuNa, bhaga (who came to be widely transmitted throughout the ancient Iranic sphere - "bhAgdAd" to the Turks and mongols - "bhagaputra/ bhagAtur, ulAn bATar")."

- "the mighty vAyu, even after zarathuShTraâ€™s heterodox sweep, remained the first receiver of the haoma in the Iranian ritual. From the Kushana evidence we note that vAyu was extremely prominent and perhaps the preeminent deity in the eastern Iranian frontier."
- "indra is only third in the system"
- "The goddess aredvI sUrA anAhitA, the sarasvatI ortholog, was one of the Iranian deities to receive an iconic representation from very early on. ...  Like sarasvatI (also perhaps even the prototype of Pallas Athena, sarasvatI and anAhitA), she had a warrior aspect. "

## Rituals
- "Iranians, like their Indic counterparts, were largely un-iconic in public ritual to start with, probably using icons only in small private shrines."
- "On the eastern front things were dramatically different, with Iranians receiving iconographic inputs not just from the Greeks but also Indians. For example vAyu of the Kushanas inherits his iconography from rudra in India. ...  The goddess aredvI sUrA anAhitA, the sarasvatI ortholog, was one of the Iranian deities to receive an iconic representation from very early on. It appears that even Artaxerxes-II, who had a special devotion to this goddess, might have founded iconic temples of hers at Hamadan, Babylon and Damascus. In the early period her iconography was influenced by Semitic goddesses such as Ishtar. But in the eastern zone of the Iranian territory her iconography was clearly influenced by chaNdikA or durgA."

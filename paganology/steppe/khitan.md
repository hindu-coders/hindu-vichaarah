- Liao (eastern khitan) empires. 
- "In their first phase the Khitans restored power of the Mongolic people through the conquest of northern China and the remnants of the Tang dynasty under their resourceful Khan Ambaqai (sinicized as Abaoji). Thus, they brought to the Mongolic world key political, administrative (e.g. the postal system) and knowledge developments that had occurred during the high-point of Chinese civilization." \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]
- Toppled by Tungustic jurchen. The jurchen were in turn toppled and pushed south by Chingiz Khan; aided by khiTan remnants who acted as their bridge with Chinese.
- Yelü Dashi's Qara (western/ black) khiTai uncharacteristically resisted conversion to Islam even while ruling over muslim subjects, in contrast with several other turkish and mongol branches. \[[SP16](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/725049903102197761)\] \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]

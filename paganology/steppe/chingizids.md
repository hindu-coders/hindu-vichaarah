Chingizid Menggu/Mengwu/ Mongol tribe. 

## Hun connection
- "From the famous rock-carving on the cliff overlooking the Tuula river facing north towards Ulan Bator dated to the 1000-1100s of CE depicting the ancestress doe (Qoa Maral) and the ancestress Alan Qoa suggest that the Mongols had re-established themselves in Mongolia by then." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]
- "It is notable that the Chingiz Khan and his successors recognized this region and established their capital of Qara Qorum in this region. This supports the continuity hinted by Chingiz recognizing the Shanyu the Xiongnu as a temporal predecessor in his letter to the cīna sage Chiu Chuji. ... Chingiz does not acknowledge these Türks as his predecessors rather he skips them going back to the earlier Huns." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]

## Legacy of Chingiz
The great chingiz temujin khAn conquered and started the empire (details [separate](../chingiz/)). General details about their foundational tactical, strategic, legal, ritual, administrative techniques are described there. 


Thence emerged:

- The Golden horde (urdu)/ Ulus of Jochi towards Russia, which after Öz Beg Khan declined due to internal conflict and Islamicized.
- Remnants of (Chagatai) Tsagadaina Khaanat Ulus ruled over mughalistaan in Ferghana area - also islamicized.
    - gUrkhAni-s Timur and babur's mogols (displaced by Oirat-s) came thence.
- House of Ögedei, later split and subsumed by chagatai and Tolui's descendents. 
- Tolui's yuan dynasty came from his Nestorian Christian wife Sorghaghtani Beki.
- From Tolui's son - Hulagu-yn Ulus/ Ilkhanate accross Iran, Iraq etc., which also islamized.

### Fall
"Finally, other than demography (relatively low numbers) and internecine conflict a key factor in the ultimate unraveling of the Mongol system was their approach to religion.  As archetypal heathens they clearly gravitated towards a version of religion closest in spirit to their own namely the Indo-Aryan religion. They received watered down versions of it from the Uighurs first and then the Tibetans. This however, did not translate into a robust religious policy. Like most archetypal heathens their natural tendency was to adopt a “secular” (used in the weird Indian sense of the usage) attitude towards the religion of their conquered peoples."


## Il-khAns
- " Il-Khans had conquered Mesopotamia after annihilating the Shi’a power of the Hashishins and the Sunni Kilafat. So the Mohammedans were no longer a political force in Mesopotamia. Yet they were able to destroy the external influences and re-establish the Shari’a." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
- "Due to the Mohammedan persecution of various groups favored by Arghun he came up with a plan to conquer Mecca and restore heathen worship there with construction of temples of buddhakapAla and heruka, but due to other preoccupations he failed to do so. Indeed, during the Ilkhanid regime multiple temples to buddhakapAla, kAlachakra and hevajra had been built in Baghdad, Tabriz and in some places in the province of Khurasan." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
- [Ghazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazan), shortly before he overthrew [Baydu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baydu), converted to [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam").

## Secularism failed here

## Ritual systems
- “There was a great battle between the demons and the Tengri in which the latter were defeated. They turned to Qormusta Khan Tengri (ahura mazdA), the high god, for aid. He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner). Aided by these deities, the Tengri fought the demons and defeated them.” {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}

### Late Indo-tibetan influence

- Tension with the earlier IA influenced tengri-ism \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)\]
- "Chingizids of the Qubilaid line might have waned into anonymity had they found a new leader in the form of the direct descendent of Qubilai Khan, Puṇyaśrī Oljei Temür. On one hand Puṇyaśrī was a learned Sanskritist, with literary interests going beyond the vajrayāṇa tantra-s and encompassing the works of Daṇḍin and Bhojadeva Paramāra. On the other he was a vigorous warrior who started rebuilding the Mongol army and drew back the Arans to his side. He repulsed the Ming thrusts into Mongolia and struck out at the Chinese forces in several encounters to the south. ... in 1424 CE the Arans and Puṇyaśrī had a falling out and the latter was killed in the conflict." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/some-notes-on-the-rise-of-oirat-power-and-the-jangar-tuuli/)\]
- Adoration of the 5th dalAi lAma sonam gyatso by Altan kakhAn, partial suppression of shamanism \[[TW17](https://i.imgur.com/c7LQTfL.jpg)\]
- Later transmission through the geluk-influenced incarnation of tAranAtha - jJNAnavajra (zanbazar).

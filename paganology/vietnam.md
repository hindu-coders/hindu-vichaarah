## Khmer-Champaka past
For a long time, Cham neighbors of Cambodia were hindus. Elite converted to Islam - thence they lost Cambodian support; and were overcome by Dai Viet.

## Dai Viet invasion of Mekong Delta
"In the 17th century a weakened Khmer state left the Mekong Delta poorly administered after repeated warfare with Siam. Concurrently Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn War in Vietnam migrated into the area. In 1623 Cambodian king Chey Chettha II (1618–1628) officially sanctioned the Vietnamese immigrants to operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, then a small fishing village. The settlement steadily grew soon becoming a major regional port, attracting even more settlers. In 1698 the Nguyễn Lords of Huế commissioned Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thus by de facto detaching it from the Kingdom of Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam. With the loss of the port of Prey Nokor, then renamed Sài Gòn, Cambodia's control of the area grew increasingly tenuous while increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers to the Delta isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from the Cambodian kingdom. By 1757 the Vietnamese had absorbed the provinces of Psar Dèk (renamed Sa Đéc in Vietnamese) on the Mekong itself, and Moat Chrouk (Vietnamized to Châu Đốc) on the Bassac River."

### Suppression of Cham
"Minh Mạng enacted assimilation policies upon the Khmer such as forcing them to adopt Sino-Vietnamese surnames, culture, and clothing. Minh Mang sinicized ethnic minorities including the Cambodians, in line with Confucianism as he diffused Vietnamese culture with China's Han civilization using the term Han people 漢人 for the Vietnamese."

"In 1832, Emperor Minh Mang set out to crush the last vestiges of Cham autonomy and stamp out the culture, burning Cham villages and farmland and destroying ancient temples. Many Cham fled to Cambodia, where their descendants number in the hundreds of thousands today."

"Cham Hindus were fed beef and Cham Muslims were fed pork under coercion by Vietnamese invaders after the Vietnamese invasion of the last part of independent Champa in 1832."

## Christian invasion
- French navy intervened in 1834 with the aim to free imprisoned Catholic missionaries from a kingdom that was perceived as xenophobic against foreign influence. Vietnam's kingdom independence was then gradually eroded by France which was aided by the Spanish and large Catholic militias in a series of military conquests between 1859 and 1885. In 1862, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country had come under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated in the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three Vietnamese entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887.
- Guerrillas of the royalist Cần Vương movement massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population during the colonial period as part of their rebellion against French rule but were defeated in the 1890s.
- The French developed a plantation economy, and ignored demands for rights and self-government. This led to a nationalist political movement. Then the the 1930 Yên Bái mutiny. The suppressed mutineers became communists.
- After Japanese defeat, France refused freedom. Việt Minh revolted, culminating in the partition and population exchange. Diệm ruled the south. In 1963, Buddhist discontent with Diệm's regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown. Then there were many military rulers.
- North Vietnam fought the south. US intervened, but were forced out by the obstinate vietcong despite bearing heavy losses (including from the use of chemical warfare).


## Christianity
- Christian population in vietnam is closer to 8% due to French colonialism & Catholic dictator Diem regime backed by USA.

## Failed proscription of Christianity
- At one point in time, Christians were required to prove fealty to the Roman deities by sacrifice (disallowed in Christianity) certified in a scroll.
- Christian exaggerations - [C Moss](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Persecution-Christians-Invented-Martyrdom-ebook/dp/B0089LOOF4/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

## Christian appropriation
- Appropriation of classical (hellenic) thought
  - socrates, plato etc.. were excellent polytheists.
  - "a man (Socrates) who by his own testimony was on a mission from Apollon."
- "Through Augustine (354–430) in the West and the 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the pseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early 6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the emergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John Scotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart). In addition, by way of a pseudo-epigraphical treatise entitled Theology of Aristotle, Neoplatonic thought facilitated the integration of ancient philosophy and science into both Islam (especially through Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna [Ibn Sina]) and Judaism (Maimonides)."

## Christianization of Roman empire
- "The most vigorous group of Neoplatonists, living in Athens and still adhering to the old rituals, disbanded in the aftermath of Emperor Justinian’s legislation of 529, which resulted in the closing of the Platonist academy."

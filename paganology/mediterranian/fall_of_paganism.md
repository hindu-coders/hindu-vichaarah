## Muted intolerance
- Inculcation of "asebeia" ("not believing in the gods of the state") as an offense was introduced in ancient Greece and used as an easy way to prosecute philosophers.
- Socrates was killed on such a charge (though devout, there were political problems with him as a gadfly irritating the Athenian horse, though ).
  - "The specifics of the charge were that his reference to his personal daimōn constituted an attempt to introduce a new illicit cult, which would have been centered upon himself." -EB.

### Failed proscription of Christianity
- At one point in time, Christians were required to prove fealty to the Roman deities by sacrifice (disallowed in Christianity) certified in a scroll.

## Robust intellectual response to Christianity
The neo-platonist tradition and lineage is described in [the platonist page](../philosophy/platonism/).

## Christian appropriation
- Appropriation of classical (hellenic) thought
  - socrates, plato etc.. were excellent polytheists.
  - "a man (Socrates) who by his own testimony was on a mission from Apollon."
- "Through Augustine (354–430) in the West and the 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the pseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early 6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the emergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John Scotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart). In addition, by way of a pseudo-epigraphical treatise entitled Theology of Aristotle, Neoplatonic thought facilitated the integration of ancient philosophy and science into both Islam (especially through Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna [Ibn Sina]) and Judaism (Maimonides)."

## Christianization of Roman empire
- "The most vigorous group of Neoplatonists, living in Athens and still adhering to the old rituals, disbanded in the aftermath of Emperor Justinian’s legislation of 529, which resulted in the closing of the Platonist academy."
- 17th Volume of Res Gestae Libri XXXI, which covers the 4th century AD, by the famous Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus: “The bishop of Alexandria Georgios and his gang went through the streets of Alexandria cutting up people and setting fire to everything. From the remotest areas of the Roman Empire countless Greeks of all ages and social backgrounds were dragged chained. Many of these died on the way or in the prisons of different places. Those that managed to survive ended up in Skythopolis, a remote town in Palestine, where instruments of torture and death were set up.”
- "The Christian historian Sozomen, in his book Ecclesiastical History, wrote that almost all Greeks were ordered to be killed, some by sword and some by fire. All the philosophers and those wearing the clothing of philosophers were also killed."
- "The Olympic, Nemea, Isthmian, Pythian and Panathenian games were stopped."
- "By some trick, history stops at the point at which the nasty Romans persecute the virtuous Christians. The history relating to the criminal Christians as persecutors of the Greeks is hushed up, just as the first death camp in world history in Skythopolis is hushed up."

### Massacre of Greeks
- "It is estimated that between the 4th and 10th century at least 20 million Greeks were exterminated. We should not forget that Greeks made up the biggest population of the Roman Empire and possibly of the world. The Greek population, before this systematic extermination, numbered about 40 million living around in the geographical areas now known as Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine."

## Plethon's academy
- MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/): "The heathen revivalist Plethon and his students reintroduced classical Greek thought back into [Cosimo de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_de%27_Medici)'s court and had a great influence on key figures in the renaissance. ... It was under the aegis of this forum provided by the Medici clan that Leonardo, several other artists and later Galileo \[who dedicated his Sidereus Nuncius to member of the clan\] received patronage."
- MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/): "First, the followers of the shavamata quickly realized that Plethon was introducing something really dangerous to their foundations: indeed, he has himself remarked to a pretAcharin that both the religions of love and peace would soon be replaced by heathenism, like that of the Hellenes. At the same time they saw that the attractive feature of Plethon’s thought was the knowledge which it brought along on scientific and mathematical topics: this is apparent from both their and the Moslems’ acknowledgment (even with tinge of admiration, despite loathing for his heathenism) of the extensive knowledge of Plethon. Thus, the realized that the best thing for the shavamata would be to absorb this knowledge and recast it inside an Abrahamistic framework while throwing out the heathenism propounded by Plethon. Ironically, this happened right in the academy of the Medici’s which was inspired by Plethon wherein his descendents in the preceptorial line like Bessarion and Argyropoulos tried to work his ideas into the pretamata. This is comparable to the earlier appropriation of heathen material by the pretamata during the period of the fall of the Roman empire. On the whole what happened was that the pretamata was not diluted, but it simply digested the alien ideas and incorporated them into its corpus."

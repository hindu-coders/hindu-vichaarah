- Cleisthenes, who ended Athenian tribal fighting by assigning everyone to ten units of ten - paving the way for the city's rise.
- Kaiser (Caeser) Augustus Octavian, first emperor, avenger of his adapted father's murder, bringer of virtue and strength.
- Julian the apostate, the last pagan emperor of Rome, likely murdered by a Christian.
  - A friend of the great Sallustius.
  - Of him, Libanius said: "I have mentioned representations (of Julian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honour him as they do the gods. Already a blessing has been besought of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from him themselves."
- Porphyry, the Greek, author of the brilliant “Against the Christians”, who was beaten up by a Christian mob in Caesarea, Palestine. \[[M](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens/)\]
- Proclus (Πρόκλος), the mathematician, and the last RShi of the yavana-s, who [preserved](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/the-end-of-the-heathens) for some time the statue of Athena uprooted in 435 CE by the edict of the rascal Theodosius.
- Martyrs such as Porphyry (author of "Against the Christians"), Hypatia - who were murdered by Christians.

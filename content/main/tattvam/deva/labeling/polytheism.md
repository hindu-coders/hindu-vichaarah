title: Polytheism

## What is polytheism?
- Polytheism is: "Any theological account in which the divine is not reducible to unity, but rather intrinsically plural."

### Reducibility to unity
- "Would the concept of the Trinity be an example of Divinity being intrinsically and irreducibly plural? Christians claim it is not (three persons, one substance)." 
- "Polytheism can be understood in terms of all Gods being inherent in *each* God, rather than all Gods being inherent in *one* God. Some authors use the term "polycentric polytheism" to refer to this understanding." - Edward Butler


## Are hindu-s monotheists (in the abrahamist sense)?
- "The term "polytheism" does no conceptual violence to Hinduism, as monotheism clearly does. ... I was just struck by the emptiness of the claim, particularly given the tight etymological kinship between देव and θεός (- poly-devism -> poly-theism)." - EB
- "Nowadays, very many Hindus will tell you that in essence, Hinduism is a monotheism. These Hindus are not even aware of the proper meaning of this word. Monotheism does not mean that you worship one God (already requiring a serious reinterpretation of the many Gods effectively worshipped by most Hindus, from the Vedic rishis on down), the way some Hindus choose one God to worship from among many, a phenomenon that scholars of religion call henotheism. Nor is it the inclusive oneness of a divine essence underlying all the gods, or monism, as enunciated in the profoundest Vedic verses. It means an exclusive worship of a jealous God banishing all others. Mono- does not mean “one”, as Hindus seem to think; it means “alone”, hence “not tolerating another”. It does not say: “Allah and Shiva are one”, it says: “Only Allah is true, burn Shiva.” So far, there is no such jealous God in Dharma." \[Koenraad Elst [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2015/02/down-with-decolonization.html)\].

## vaiShNava monotheism trope

"vaiShNavas are monotheist" is about as useful a characterization as "humans are apes". Point is that they are not "monotheistic" in the same sense as the desert madnesses. Clear significant points of deviation are:

- \* viShNu can appear in avatAra-s a multitude of whom are adored.
- \* viShNu has a consort, a vehicle and innumerable servants and devotees who are also adored in about the same way as viShNu.
- \* Even shiva, shakti, skanda etc.. are considered limited aspects of viShNu, and as such their adoration is not considered evil - merely inferior from one's own perspective. They are not characterized as "false gods" (in the sense of the semitic cancers). This is non-exclusivism.  

Terminology (such as "monotheism") should illuminate complex subjects and bring clarity - not promote confusion and nonsense false-equivalences. Perhaps people should move beyond "monotheism" and learn more terms such as Jan Assman's "Mosaic distinction".

Coming back to the immediate point - these sardaars show traits typical of secularists - on the surface turned their backs on mosaic religion, while retaining the same disdain for heathens and their practices. In other words, the beliefs are different, but patterns in thoughts and practices remain like a poison dart stabbing heathen welfare.

Same applies to pAshupata-s and such shaiva-s.

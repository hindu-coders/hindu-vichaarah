## Monotheism vs Polytheism

### Are hindu-s monotheists (in the abrahamist sense)?
- "The term "polytheism" does no conceptual violence to Hinduism, as monotheism clearly does. ... I was just struck by the emptiness of the claim, particularly given the tight etymological kinship between देव and θεός (- poly-devism -> poly-theism)." - EB
- "Nowadays, very many Hindus will tell you that in essence, Hinduism is a monotheism. These Hindus are not even aware of the proper meaning of this word. Monotheism does not mean that you worship one God (already requiring a serious reinterpretation of the many Gods effectively worshipped by most Hindus, from the Vedic rishis on down), the way some Hindus choose one God to worship from among many, a phenomenon that scholars of religion call henotheism. Nor is it the inclusive oneness of a divine essence underlying all the gods, or monism, as enunciated in the profoundest Vedic verses. It means an exclusive worship of a jealous God banishing all others. Mono- does not mean “one”, as Hindus seem to think; it means “alone”, hence “not tolerating another”. It does not say: “Allah and Shiva are one”, it says: “Only Allah is true, burn Shiva.” So far, there is no such jealous God in Dharma." \[Koenraad Elst [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2015/02/down-with-decolonization.html)\].

### vaiShNava monotheism trope

"vaiShNavas are monotheist" is about as useful a characterization as "humans are apes". Point is that they are not "monotheistic" in the same sense as the desert madnesses. Clear significant points of deviation are:

- \* viShNu can appear in avatAra-s a multitude of whom are adored.
- \* viShNu has a consort, a vehicle and innumerable servants and devotees who are also adored in about the same way as viShNu.
- \* Even shiva, shakti, skanda etc.. are considered limited aspects of viShNu, and as such their adoration is not considered evil - merely inferior from one's own perspective. They are not characterized as "false gods" (in the sense of the semitic cancers). This is non-exclusivism.  

Terminology (such as "monotheism") should illuminate complex subjects and bring clarity - not promote confusion and nonsense false-equivalences. Perhaps people should move beyond "monotheism" and learn more terms such as Jan Assman's "Mosaic distinction".

Coming back to the immediate point - these sardaars show traits typical of secularists - on the surface turned their backs on mosaic religion, while retaining the same disdain for heathens and their practices. In other words, the beliefs are different, but patterns in thoughts and practices remain like a poison dart stabbing heathen welfare.

Same applies to pAshupata-s and such shaiva-s.

## (A)theism/ (a)dEvism?

The English word God may to a hindu mean either a deity ([dEvatA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_%28Hinduism%29)) or that which pervades everything ([brahman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)) (both of which are distinct from the Abrahamist notion of a true God). This leads to confusion while talking to Hindus. Hindu-s have a stronger need (because of unique conditioning) for distinguishing deva from brahman compared to say Egyptians or Japanese. So, their tendency to take God to mean brahman is quite understandable.

This results in hindu-s confusingly (and to a certain extant, confusedly) identifying themselves as "monotheists" rather than polytheists, and calling their gods "demigods". This is misuse of an language (which is inadequate in the first place), given what these terms mean to others - like having to do arithmetic using the roman numerals rather than the hindu place-value numeric notation.

The latter is mostly uncontrovertial, so we deal with the fomer.  

Personal note: For all purposes practical to most atheists, I am an atheist (in that I don't believe in a god who orchestrates supernatural phenomena to answer prayers); yet in nearly all ways which matter to most theists, I am a theist.

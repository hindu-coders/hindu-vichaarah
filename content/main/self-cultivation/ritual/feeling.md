## Knowledge and feeling
- भावना च समीचीना न चेद् शुष्कानुकरणेन न ह्य् अधिकं सिद्ध्यति - "य एवँव्विद्वानग्निहोत्रञ्जुहोति …",  "एवँव्विद्वान्दर्‌शपूर्णमासौ यजते परमामेव काष्ठाङ्गच्छति ", "य एवँव्विद्वान्दशरात्रेण यजते …" इत्यादीनि वाक्यानि ज्ञानपूर्वककर्माणि प्रशंसन्ति। 
- Whatever we practice, it is important that we don't reduce ourselves to becoming practitioners of a "cargo cult" (they built repilicas of airports and airplanes hoping for "goods" to start coming again).  Rather, we should strive to reclaim the vigor and happiness of our forefathers, who were in perfect sync with Rta and the seasons, and whose dharma led them to victory and success everywhere they went (rather than becoming paralyzed by peripheri). Among other things, the darbhas should remind us of their life in the andhas, the bull-rib/ horse-rib placed next to the gArhapatya should remind us of their smashing cavalry, the darbhAgra-s we throw into the Ajya should remind us of indra's vajra etc.. The thought of imbibing and emulating the thoughts and ways of our sagely forefathers should raise pulaka-s on our skin.
- यदि ब्राह्मणाः "इन्द्रो ज्येष्ठाम् अनु नक्षत्रमेति" इति ब्रुवाणो ऽपि ज्येष्ठां नक्षत्रम् आकाशे न दर्शयितुं शक्नुवन्ति, यदि सोमदैवतकं साम "श्री"-शब्दयुक्तत्वाद् भ्रान्त्या लक्ष्मीपूजायां प्रयुञ्जते, यद्येवम् अर्थम् अनवगत्य विपरीतं वावगत्य रटन्ति, तेषां कर्माणि "cargo cult" कर्माण्येव। अल्पफलान्येव तानि भवेयुः।

### Value of ignorant performance
Definitely, there is value in being the donkey that carries the sandalwood, a la - "यथा खरश्चन्दनभारवाही भारस्य वेत्ता न तु चन्दनस्य। एवं हि शास्त्राणि बहून्यधीत्य अर्थेषु मूढाः खरवद् वहन्ति ॥". But it is not good if donkeys dominate true vidvAns in culture. Based on one's circumstance and abilities, it is good to strive to be more than the donkey.

## Structure vs feeling tension

- The veda-s emphasize both proper and meticulous performance; and feeling (There is the story {[TS 2.6.10](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_042_Krishna_Yajurvediya_Taittiriya_Samhita_Part_5_-_Kasinath_Sastri_Agase_1946#page/n93/mode/1up)} of shaMyu who to whom fruits of yajJNA are to be diverted, if it is performed without devotional feeling or without respect for prescribed structure).
- "Of course, if we say "just pray from heart", it becomes too open and possibly chaotic. Rules are there to enforce discipline and provide some structure. But, if there are too many rules, the same thing that is intended to provide structure to the ritual can become constricting and suffocating. The suffocation may eliminate all feeling from the ritual. Based on one's desa-kala-patra, one has to find the right balance between rules (Pingala, solar channel) and emotion (Ida, lunar channel). One should follow some rules that provide a structure without suffocating one and allow one to add emotion to the ritual. Then one can make a connection." [NR_FB15](https://www.facebook.com/pvr108/posts/10153156010758284).


### Examples of "feeling" trumping:
#### In the veda-s 
\[[TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/853343223342878721)\].

- "kavaSa ailUSa who was expelled by the RSis from a sattra on account of his maternal heritage (she was a dAsa woman; I suspect druhyu heritage). Expelled to the desert & suffering from thirst he sees the aponaptrīya sūkta and in the desert, the waters of the sarasvatI run to him."
- "The innocent, naive devotee whose silly actions still please the deity: kaNNappa nAyanmAr's spitting water on rudra as ablution to a creative mind, can be said to be prefigured in the story of apālā who chews the soma plant with her teeth to press out the juice for Indra."
- "The trope of the devotee who risks everything for his cherished deva: could be said to be prefigured in the story of Rjrashva who, seeing a she-wolf (and recognizing it as the divine animal it was; I.e. Sent by the ashvinau), offered a hundred sheep to satiate it and was blinded by his father as a consequence! However, the ashvinau, pleased with him, gave back his eyes."

#### In the itihAsa-s and purANa-s
- shabari giving rAma berries she tasted for sweetness.
- Hunter kaNNappa spitting water on rudra as ablution.

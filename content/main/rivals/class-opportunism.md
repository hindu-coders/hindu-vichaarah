title: Class opportunism
---
## Intro
Even as the dharma tries time-tested arragnements to harmonize various social groups based on different abilities and roles; certain "revolutionary" movements attempt to do the reverse. They seek to topple the hitherto dominant social groups and firmly establish themselves at the top - at the cost of reducing the overall fitness of the society (both in the short and long term). This is reminiscent of ["The Trees" by Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_D0wkLyCXE).

Their misguided attempts derive from various misunderstandings. In their deeply flawed analysis, they refuse to believe the honest and natural basis for the hindu dharma history - rather preferring to see "evil brAhmaNa manipulation". This is accompanied by a risible claims about history - for example:
- Dravidians claiming their origin in Lemuria
- Dravidians being unaware of the Dravidian bloom {[IA in India page](../../social-cultivation/clan/india-entry/)}
- claims to being original inhabitants and insinuating that the few brAhmaNa-s who later arrived ended up "dominating" the social structure against their will
- denying the deep contributions of hindu thoughtscape (carried by brAhmaNa-s) to the development of their language and culture
- claiming notable ancient cultural/ religious icons and practices (eg: Buddha, kumAra, gaNesha and Shiva) as belong to their ethnicity.

## Counter religions
Sometimes class opportunism is combined with native spiritual movements. See [Ananda addiction page](../aananda-addiction/).

## Dalitism
As an archetype, bhIm rAv [ambeDkar](../../https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar), who strived for respect and opportunities for the untouchable jAti-s (sAvarkar on him: [img1](http://i.imgur.com/fhQO1Yf.jpg)) \- even at the cost of hinduism or Indian independence. More in the [Heroes page listing](../history/heroes/).

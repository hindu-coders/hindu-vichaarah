### Acceptance
- hard core khAlistanis who don't even accept dahsam granth.

## Drives
### Disdain for "failure" hindu
- Sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms. See anti-hindu patterns for details.

### mIri-pIri  
- It aimed to rearm hindus (spiritually and materially) during oppressive Mughal muslim times by emphasizing kShatra.

### Virtual kin marker temorarily increasing group fitness
- "In this context one could also bring up the case of the pA~nchanada-uShnIShamoha. This moha emerged as result of part but not whole of the khilimoha infecting the Hindu population of the pa~nchanada. The result was the emergence of a new recombinant memetic virus, the uShnIShamoha that retained the self-propagating tendencies of the original khilimoha. This infection was very mild in terms of fitness reduction, but provided a strong virtual kin marker that allowed the infected group to prevail and spread at the expense of the Hindus of the pa~nchanada, and also offered protection to the infected against being overrun by the spreading khilimoha. But as its numbers increased its utility as such a virtual kin marker diminished. Nevertheless, it continues to serve this purpose to a degree in new areas colonized by its carriers, such as North America." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]

### British subversion
- Kahn Singh Nabha + macauliffe.

## Anti-hindu patterns
Many sardaars show traits typical of secularists - on the surface turned their backs on mosaic religion, while retaining the same disdain for heathens and their practices. This likely has its roots in the perceived failure and abject subservient state of hindus during mogol times in the panchanada area. 

Some disturbing patterns include:

- Equating hinduism with inimical abrahamisms
- Image worship (and many other hindu activities) are considered "superstition" - the video fits right in. (This should remind you of the anti-superstition = anti-hindu legislation of our sickular overlords). This often degenerates to active iconoclasm or tolerance of iconoclasm - (W1, [W2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry_in_Sikhism#Smiting_of_the_nose_of_Durga.27s_idol))
- Mocking of hindu rituals (upanayana, tarpaNa by guru NAnak, durgA pUjA by some later guru according to some accounts).
- Some problem shabads in the granth sahib come from Kabir.

### khAlistAn context
Hinduism is a minority religion in Punjab. During the Khalistan movement, the minority Hindus and Jains were subjected to several attacks. Hindu and Jain temples were frequently vandalized and desecrated. This thread documents a few instances.

It is to be noted that many of these incidents happened prior to the Operation Blue Star carried out by Congress Government in 1984. The attacks of Hindu temples were not confined to just Punjab. The radicals crossed over Punjab into Haryana and bombed Hindu temples.


### Temple attacks
Below info is from the bhAradvAja on twitter.

#### durgiAna amRtsar
Durgiana Mandir is one of the oldest temples of Amritsar. According to the regional Hindu tradition, the temple was built on the spot where Lava and Kusha bound Hanuman. The temple annually attracts millions of Hindus from all over the country. Amristsar has a very ancient Hindu history. According to the regional Hindu tradition recorded in the "Survey of Amritsar", Amritsar got its name from Amrit immersed by Lava and Kusha in a pond.

Durgiana Mandir was rebuilt in 1921. It was used to house the Murtis of Vishnu and Durga which were thrown out from the Parikrama of Harmandir Sahib in 1905.

Because of its presence in Amritsar, it became a frequent target of radicals during the Khalistan movement. In 1982, in what was a completely unprovoked attack, the Dal Khalsa "activists" threw a severed cow head inside Durgiana temple.

#### mahAkAlI paTiyAlA
Mahakali temple of Patiala is a very famous temple. It was built by Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Murti of Kali was brought from Bengal. In 1982, Khalistani radicals hung tail of a cow inside the Mahakali temple of Patiala. Devotees were shocked to see the tail of a cow hung inside the Garba Griha of the temple. Dal Khalsa, an organization which claims that it strives to establish an independent Khalsa state, not only took responsibility for these attacks but also declared their intention of repeating them.

#### rAm-tIrat
Ram Tirath is one of the oldest temples of Amritsar. According to the Hindu tradition, Ram Tirath was the place where Goddess Sita gave birth to Lava and Kusha. On December 3 1983, Khalistani activists sprinkled petrol on the Murtis of Krishna, Subhadra and Balrama inside the Garba Girha of Ram Tirath temple and set the Murtis on fire. 

#### Panchmukhi Hanuman
Panchmukhi Hanuman Mandir is a very famous temple of Haryana. Coins of ancient Yaudheyas dating back to 100 BC have been found at this ancient temple. On November 21 1983, two bombs were thrown on this temple. A damaged section was later rebuilt by funds collected from devotees 

#### shivAlA
Shivala temple of Amritsar was bombed on Shivaratri Image
During the Shivala temple bombing on February 29 1984, 3 people were kiIIed and 32 injured. The damaged section of the temple could not be rebuilt until 2005! 

Khalistani radicals bombed Shivala Hindu temple and a market, killing 28 and injuring 100. This was the second attack on the temple in 4 years.

#### Santhoshi Mata
The Santhoshi Mata temple had been a recently constructed temple of Punjab. A recently constructed Hindu temple was seen by radicals as an affront to them.

April 8 1984: Bomb exploded in the courtyard of Santoshi Mata temple, kiIIing the home guard and chowkidar.

#### Other attacks
April 16 1990 Bomb Near Hindu Temple Kills 5 in Northern India (Published [1990](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/world/bomb-near-hindu-temple-kills-5-in-northern-india.html))

### Anti-jaina
On May 5, 1984 Jain temple in Amritsar was looted and desecrated. Because the Jains are a very affluent community, Jain temples were seen by radicals as a great source for loot.

On February 28 of the same year, another Jain temple was looted.


### Attacking hindu gatherings
- Radicals desecrated Ram Lila. May 31 1988
- They bombed Hindu fairs like Shivaratri & Ramnavami where Hindus gathered in large numbers to ensure maximum Hindu kiIIings.
- In 1980s and 1990s, not everybody in Punjab had television sets. People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals. 5 kiIIed
- Like Mahabharata, the great epic Ramayana was also the target of these radicals. 1988: People watching Ramayana in public were bombed by Khalistan radicals. Mind you, the attack took place in Hindu majority Kurukshetra (Haryana) and not Punjab. Bombs are new weapon in Punjab terrorists' arsenal.

### Anti-v1
Brahmins were a favorite target of Khalistani activists. Bhindranwale's rhetoric frequently centred on anti Brahmanism.

On 25th June 1983, a Pujari of a temple in Sultanpur was kiIIed with a sharp knife. While attacks on Hindu places of worship have abated in Punjab, thanks to the anti militancy drives of police and army, they are not completely a thing of past.

In 2020, a Hindu priest was warned and shot at. 



## Pro-hindu patterns
### Better orders
- Exceptional orders, which need to be promoted at the expense of khAlistAni akAli subversive traitors.
- arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev's shabads form the bulk of granth sahib.
- udAsi-s who controlled gurudvAra-s before AkAli takeover in 1920-s.
- sanAtan shastar vidyA \[[SV16](http://www.shastarvidiya.org/articles/misunderstandings.html)\]

### Limited defence
- Shikhs are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism. This exaggerates their relatively minor role relative to, say, the marATha-s; and underplays the real strong hindu influences on the later Sikh elite (like ranjit singh).

#### Govinda-siMha
> "Among other things, Govind assures Aurangzeb that he is just as much an idol-breaker as the Padeshah himself: “I am the destroyer of turbulent hillmen, since they are idolators and I am the breaker of idols.” Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the correspondence (possibly several letters) he received from the Guru, for he ordered Wazir Khan not to trouble Govind any longer. ... So far, it is hard to see where the Sikhs have acted as the sword-arm of Hinduism against Islam. If secularism means staying on reasonable terms with both Hindus and Muslims, we could concede that the Gurus generally did steer a “secular” course. Not that this is shameful: in the circumstances, taking on the Moghul Empire would have been suicidal." \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2011/12/guru-tegh-bahadurs-martyrdom.html)11\]

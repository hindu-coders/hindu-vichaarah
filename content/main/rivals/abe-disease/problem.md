## Zero sum game
- "National anthem, Cashmereyaut, suppression of dummy grad students etc are mere facades for the really elephant in the room that H themselves are afraid to see -- there can be no coexistence between Abe and the heathens & Abe will do all it takes to make us fertilizer for the soil." \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/762346994333519873)\]

## Why natural polytheisms? Why the big deal?
### Objection versions
- "Let everyone get along by just belonging to the same religion - all roads lead to God. Why the confusion?"
- "polytheism can continue with angels and saints under monotheism (as in folk catholicism) - so no need to resist and fuss about its preservation".

### Answers
#### Objective
- Monotheisms are a serious memetic disease of epidemic proportions which naturally sap the genius and vitality of individuals and communities. So, it is best to fight and minimize this disease as much as possible.
  - Better connection to the universe, better care for our environment, more creativity (via greater freedom and superior access to truly divine inspiration), less energy spent on proselytization that uproots people from their ancestral cults ...
- Intolerance for intolerance is essential - anything else is suicidal. More in [tolerance page](../../../polity/external-affairs/tolerance/).
- Also see: particular [benefits of hinduism](../../../hinduism/benefits/) 

#### Subjective
- Having to hide and secretly preserve one's polytheistic beliefs from dormant or active monotheist enforcers is irksome for polytheists. 
- "Our Gods are real and desire and deserve devotion without being hidden inside an oppressive faith". 
- Further, it is in a sense "claustrophobic" and ugly for polytheist devotees.

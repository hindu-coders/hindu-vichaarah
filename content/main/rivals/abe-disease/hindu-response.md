title: Hindu response
---


- Military response - see [here](../../../polity/external-affairs/defence/).
    - [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/) posits: "Mohammedanism needed special backing for its effective survival in the subcontinent. ... Demographic and missionary aggression by Mohammedanism might not have been sufficient for it to overrun the Hindu dharma."

- "The striving for non-Hinduness might have even lead to internal rifts within Mohammedanism as each group was trying be more Mohammedan than the other. " \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\]

## Attacks on the Abrahamisms at an intellectual level.

### Muted inquiry into the Abrahamisms

In classical Indian literature "the Muslims, who were not only present in India for many centuries, but were its actual rulers, appear only in vague and marginal references" (HALBFASS 1988: 182); "the Sanskrit tradition has never taken official notice of the existence of Islam" (ERNST 1992: 30); "I would lay stress on this - the religious identity of the Central Asians \[who invaded India\] is not once thematized in Sanskrit sources" (POLLOCK 1993: 286). 

### Intelligent critiques

A few Hindu-s did understand and produce some very high-quality critiques of Abrahamistic thought. For example, we have a 9th century apostate of Islam, Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Ishak al-Rawandi, quoting barAhima (or brAhmaNa-s) of al-hind:  

“_If prophets are sent to preach adherence to things that can be established by the use of intellect then the prophets are just like ordinary people. If, of the other hand, they come to preach what contradicts those things – god has made those things to be perceived as proofs; they will not suit anything else except through the altering/perversion of the intellect itself._”  

Other reports:

- Judaist Dawood ibn Marwan \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/751268220527489025/photo/1)\]
- Ancient judaist claim to priority \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/751276710968954881/photo/1)\]

In the 19th century, we see excellent critiques by dayananda sarasvatI and [arumuka nalavAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arumuka_Navalar) \- and to some extant by vivekAnanda.

### Kalachakra Tantra

From [Heid1998](https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8878/2785): In Sanskrit literature the Kalacakra tantra is unique in presenting a fairly comprehensive and quite accurate portrayal of Islamic beliefs and practices. \[[WP](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/08/portrayal-of-muslims-in-kalachakra-tantra/)\]

### Heathenizing Abrahamists

- There was some extra-military response to Islam during muslim reign \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\], involving conversion of muslims, apostacies of Akbar and Dara Shukoh etc..
    - Apostasy of Akbar: [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/) and [B](http://bharatendu.com/2009/07/06/akbar-transition-5/).
- Tuglaq times: " brAhmaNa of Delhi had constructed a wooden seal on which were engraved the pictures of Hindu deities. Large numbers of Hindus resorted to his house to worship the seal. He had also converted Moslem women to the Hindu polytheism." [MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)
- mahArAShTra: "In mahArAShTra the influencing and conversion of Moslems by Hindu religious figure is recorded into the 1600s of CE – e.g. an enigmatic female shaiva teacher who was active in this regard in the Adilshahi territory of the 1600s. In south India we hear of the great bhAskararAya makhIndra converting a Turkic woman to the Hindu fold in the 1700s. " \[[MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/some-notes-on-the-extra-military-aspects-of-the-islamo-hindu-confrontation/)\]
- vanga-desha
    - maa bonbibi (= mulsimified forest deity vanadevI durgA) of the sundarban-s [IFC15](http://infochangeindia.org/environment/features/maa-bonbibi-in-the-land-of-tigers.html).

### Resistance to conversion

The Hindu identity provides some resistance from pressure to convert to Abrahamisms.

- Relatively more successful resistance to Christianity in Manipur (which is 46% Hindu, compared with a small minority in Nagaland \[[History](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/shifting-from-manupur-to-nagaland-christian-missionaries-resisted-by-vaishnavism/)\].

### Reconversion

- Hindu law:
    - Reconversion to the hindu ethos was codified in the devala-smRti \[[PVK_IMG1](https://imgur.com/8ZlWt2a), [TW17](https://twitter.com/vajrayudha11/status/865964633894649856)\] and Vignaneswara’s commentary to Yagyavalkya Smriti \[[S](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/caste-is-hardly-an-impediment-for-homecoming-hindus/)\].
- In Practice:
    - \[Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Culture, by DR Bhandarkar, Rev. JM Anthos, Asian Educational Services, 1989. pp 68.\] quotes an incident in 1398-99 CE during the Vijayanagara era, in which 2,000 Brahmin girls of a village were rescued from the armies of Firoz Shah Bahmani and accepted after purification rites \[1\].
    - "The Shuddhi movement of Arya Samaj, carried to many parts of the north in the early decades of 1900s by Swami Shraddhananda, is nothing but a continuation of this long-time Hindu practice."

### Problematic immunity and the idiot baba-s.

- While Muslims and Christians did some comparitive study of Hindu civilization and culture, the Hindu-s did not reciprocate - at least not in equal volume. Rather, many Hindu-s made idiotic and misleading statements such as "All religions are equal. You can be a good Hindu by being a good Muslim or Christian".
- Kanchi MahasvamI produced foolishness that claimed crazy stuff such as "all religions are the same", "ramses and rama are related", "aztec is probably a corrpution of Astika" etc.. ([1](http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/articles/Jagadguru%20Divya%20Chareitram%20Hindu%20Culture%20from%20Egypt%20to%20Java%20English.html)).
    - But, a mitigating factor: "the AchArya was not a svayaM-devatA-vAdin & upheld the deva-dharma sincerely despite certain serious idiosyncratic misapprehensions".
- Criticism
    - Swami Aksharananda (Guyana) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJKQdhXzvo).

###   
Rousing fight to expel the Abrahamist threat

- "Make the people one; fill their minds with the single thought of resisting the Mleccha enemy..." - Samarth Ramdas's letter advising Sambhaji. \[ [K1](http://kalchiron.blogspot.com/2014/06/advice-by-ramdas-swamy-to-sambhaji.html)\]  

- "He (Vijayanagara ruler) commanded the Brahmins to deliver every day to the troops discourses on the meritoriousness of slaughtering the Mohammedans, in order to excite zeal for expelling them. He ordered them to describe the butchery of cows, the insults to sacred images, and destroying of temples, practiced by the true believers." - Ferishta \[[GB](http://books.google.com/books?id=TQZUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=He+ordered+them+to+describe+the+butchery+of+cows,+the+insults+to+sacred+images,+and+destroying+of+temples,+practised+by+the+true+believers.&source=bl&ots=ISgEDXrpCx&sig=zv0le6LRnc6EasJjjV5kEmzejCw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Edq8U4qJDdbpoASP04HwDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=He%20ordered%20them%20to%20describe%20the%20butchery%20of%20cows%2C%20the%20insults%20to%20sacred%20images%2C%20and%20destroying%20of%20temples%2C%20practised%20by%20the%20true%20believers.&f=false)\].

## Solidarity with other pagans/ polytheists.

## Political demography of muslims

    - Ridiculous fatwas (judicial opinions of mullah-s/ ulema-s) continue to be issued \[See[Arun Shourie's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iVIec5e3_0&feature)\] around the muslim world. Yes, this "high literature" does influence the lives and attitudes of muslims.
        - Examples: Opinions on [beating women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-q9GTure4), sex slaves (Details in a separate section).
    - Sharia policing within (even minority) muslim communities and neighborhoods.
        - Societies such as [Tablighi Jamat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat) (India) enforce retrograde mores among the muslim ummah.
        - In a [German city](http://www.dw.de/locals-concerned-as-sharia-police-patrol-streets-of-german-city/a-17904887).

    - Islamists vs Jihadists
        - Islamists are in favor of establishing a muslim state and curb infiedels "eventually"; but they are not willing to start or participate in a revolution to accomplish it "right now". Jihadists, on the other hand, want to do it \*now\* and are willing to kill/ die for it.

        - "Salafis are not jihadists, and most adhere to sects that reject the Islamic State. They are, as Haykel notes, committed to expanding Dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, even, perhaps, with the implementation of monstrous practices such as slavery and amputation—but at some future point. Their first priority is personal purification and religious observance, and they believe anything that thwarts those goals—such as causing war or unrest that would disrupt lives and prayer and scholarship—is forbidden." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Estimates of the percentage of people with radical beliefs in muslim population is at 15-25%, even if the fraction of people who work outside the system to act on them (by terrorizing others) is smaller.

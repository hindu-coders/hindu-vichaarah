## Political demography of muslims

- WikiIslam statistics [here](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Muslim_Statistics).
- Islamists vs Jihadists
    - Islamists are in favor of establishing a muslim state and curb infiedels "eventually"; but they are not willing to start or participate in a revolution to accomplish it "right now". Jihadists, on the other hand, want to do it \*now\* and are willing to kill/ die for it.

    - "Salafis are not jihadists, and most adhere to sects that reject the Islamic State. They are, as Haykel notes, committed to expanding Dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, even, perhaps, with the implementation of monstrous practices such as slavery and amputation—but at some future point. Their first priority is personal purification and religious observance, and they believe anything that thwarts those goals—such as causing war or unrest that would disrupt lives and prayer and scholarship—is forbidden." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Estimates of the percentage of people with radical beliefs in muslim population is at 15-25%, even if the fraction of people who work outside the system to act on them (by terrorizing others) is smaller.

## Other False hopes

- The [muta'zila movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27tazila), which tried to get to the position that the Quran is man-made and argued for rationality, was vanquished 10 centuries ago, and has not really resurged. Though, there are very small hopeful signs. 
    - Jihad Turk denies that the biographies of muhammad are reliable since they were written 200 years after his death, so he was not such a horrible person \[[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLjMaIR0-k)\]. But, his grounds are shaky elsewhere \[eg: [rebuttal](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-local-imam-misleads-interfaith-groups)\].
- Ahmadiyya-s are about as bad for pagans, despite their rejection by other muslims. Furqan Force ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furqan_Force)) fought India in 1949.

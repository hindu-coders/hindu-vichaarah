title: Treatment

## Broad goals

RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness (as Chinese are doing [NYB_2019](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/reeducating-xinjiangs-muslims/) ). As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained. The only language that the infected people understand and appreciate is one of solid firmness ([MBS_19](https://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-mohammad-bin-salman-defends-china-concentration-camps-muslims-1340592)).

### Disease awareness
- Understand the relentless nature of the Islamic desire to be to overcome all non-muslims. 
- Understand the glacial and whirlwind approaches of Islam. So, Islamo-fascism, like terrorism, is antifragile.
- Excuses such as "most muslims (ie the afflicted people) don't show severe symptoms - they are good normal people", "Sufi so great, all is joy, God is one, we are all brothers" etc.. are just techneques of fooling oneself.

### Anticipate a long struggle
- "Thus, any campaign with marūnmāda is not finished with the killing of this or that marūnmatta. Certainly, their prominent leaders need to be constantly targeted and comprehensively eliminated. But this in itself gets one nowhere closer to victory. Instead any group which wishes to survive marūnmāda needs to prepare itself for an arms-race on an evolutionary scale, like the ceaseless war between bacteria and their viruses which has been going on for more than three billion years." \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/09/a-geopolitical-package-july-2016/)\]
- NN Taleb on how to deal with such - [NNT16](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/776691991887347713) [NNT16](http://i.imgur.com/t0fFA6d.jpg). You should not look for mitigation, rather focus on eradication.

### Subvert
- Support apostasy among muslims.
    - [Ex muslims of North America](http://www.exmna.org/). UK.
    - The emotional and physical challenges to being an Ex-Muslim, especially woman - [YT15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW7wRfuSw0A).
- Support subversion of Islam into a \*definitely\* more benign ideology.
    - No half-measures - this necessarily involves questioning and rejecting the authority of the quran and the hadith. One can claim things such as:
        - Much islamic scripture was composed centuries after muhammad's death. So, they should be rejected. (Eg. Tarek Fatah [here](http://tarekfatah.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-muslim-and-an-islamist/))
        - Islam was originally polytheist and tolerant, but was transformed by muslims after muhammad's death.
- Boldly speak the truth about Islamo-fascism.
    - Parodies
        - Islam of rasgolla ([WP15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/welcome-to-the-true-islam/)).

### Thoughts elsewhere
- Koenraad's recommendations [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-gentle-cure-for-intolerance.html).

## Examples
- 2018: Rwanda banned mosques in the capital, Kigali, from using loudspeakers. \[[BBC18](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43413645)\]
- 2015-16: Tajikistan. Tajikistan has 99% Muslim population. But the state is wary of Jihadism and doesn't allow Hijab for girls, no kids in mosques and no loudspeakers either. Mosques can't have sermons longer than 15 min. Long beards are banned too.

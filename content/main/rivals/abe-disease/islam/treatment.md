title: Treatment
---

## Motivation

RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness (as Chinese are doing [NYB_2019](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/02/07/reeducating-xinjiangs-muslims/) ). As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained. Excuses such as "most muslims (ie the afflicted people) don't show severe symptoms - they are good normal people", "Sufi so great, all is joy, God is one, we are all brothers" etc.. are just techneques of fooling oneself.


## Examples
- 2018: Rwanda banned mosques in the capital, Kigali, from using loudspeakers. \[[BBC18](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43413645)\]
- 2015-16: Tajikistan. Tajikistan has 99% Muslim population. But the state is wary of Jihadism and doesn't allow Hijab for girls, no kids in mosques and no loudspeakers either. Mosques can't have sermons longer than 15 min. Long beards are banned too.

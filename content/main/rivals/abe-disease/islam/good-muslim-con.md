## Good muslims

- Many muslims are good (or atleast appear good under many circumstances) and benign towards non-muslims despite their religion.
- Such goodness (or appearence thereof) may manifest itself through statements sympathizing with victims of jihaadi attacks, condemning jihadi terrorists, and very rarely - by actually fighting against jihadis.

### Examples

- Eg:Â [dharmadeen list](http://dharmadeen.com/),[gay imam](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/gay-muslim-imam-brings-message-of-tolerance-to-europe-a-985863.html#spRedirectedFrom=www&referrrer=http://t.co/EC09h1pcc4).

## Source of goodness

- Not every Nazi party member during WW2 was actually a bad person - there were even the likes of Oskar Schindler - similar is the case with Muslims.

## Limited potency of the mildly infected

- In a muslim society, these numerous tolerant muslims tend not to successfully challenge their more virulent corelegionists that stick to their constitution (Quran, Hadith etc..) - as observing Terrorist state of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc.. (as of 2014) will reveal.
- So, while some may make some statements sympathizing with victims of jihaadi attacks, condemning terrorists - they hardly take to arms at a rate sufficient to neutralize their anti-kufr jihadi warriors. So, the net effect of Islam remains negative to the kufr population.
- Rather, they tend to mostly cooperate (with or without misgivings) in heinous acts. So, it certainly matters what the RoP holy books say.
- But, their "moderation" has very weak theological basis/ solid clerical support, as explained in a separate section.

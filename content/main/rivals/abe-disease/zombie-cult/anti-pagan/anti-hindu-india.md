## Past misdeeds in India
### Portuguese Catholic assault
- Francis Xavier and Portuguese rule.
    - “The fruit that is reaped by the baptism of infants, as well as by the instruction of children and others, is quite incredible…Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship, I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil \[statues of Hindu gods\] with a greater amount of insult and abuse…The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage.” \[[Xaviers college letter](http://centreright.in/2014/04/an-open-letter-to-the-students-of-st-xaviers-college-mumbai/comment-page-1/#.VLJ5LjlGjUY)\]
    - Goa inquisition \[[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition)\]
        - [SV_YT18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nEseljBZ-c&feature=youtu.be)
        - "In his letter to John III, King of Portugal, dated 16th May 1545, Xavier called upon the king to “establish the Holy Inquisition” because there were many who lived according to their laws of belief and “without any fear of God or shame of the world.”" \[[Xaviers college letter](http://centreright.in/2014/04/an-open-letter-to-the-students-of-st-xaviers-college-mumbai/comment-page-1/#.VLJ5LjlGjUY)\]
        - This involved:
            - [4 Persecution of Hindus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Persecution_of_Hindus)
                - Quotes [1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/573632135791276032).
            - [5 Persecution of Christians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Persecution_of_Christians) [5.1 Persecution of Goan Catholics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Persecution_of_Goan_Catholics)
            - [5.1.1 Suppression of Konkani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Suppression_of_Konkani)
            - [5.2 Persecution of Syrian Christians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa_Inquisition#Persecution_of_Syrian_Christians)
        - Some acceptance by modern Christian Goans
        - [BS15](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/india-s-first-anti-colonialist-uprising-predates-mangal-pandey-s-by-274-years-115071800333_1.html?utm_source=Offstumped_Report&utm_medium=Offstumped_Report&utm_term=Offstumped_Report&utm_campaign=Offstumped_Report): "The struggle, in which several lives were lost, dates back to 16th century when early Christian missionaries along with their Portuguese armed escorts tried to convert the residents of these five villages to Christianity. When the attempts largely failed, the missionaries destroyed nearby temples, which enraged the villagers, resulting in the massacre of some priests including Fr. Rudolfo Acquaviva - an Italian Jesuit who had also held position at Emperor Akbar's court and has since been beatified - and their colleagues on July 15, 1583."
    - Temple destruction and looting in vijayanagara. 
        - Foiled raid on tirmala, destruction in malbar, nAgapaTTanam, mangaLUru etc.. [The\_Portuguese\_Vijayanagar\_War\_of_1558](https://www.academia.edu/5562669/The_Portuguese_Vijayanagar_War_of_1558) thesis.
    - Their depredations hampered the Kerala maths and astronomy university at tirunavaya
- Dissimulation as European brAhmaNa-s  - De Nobili, [AbbeD](https://books.google.ca/books?id=xWY3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA634&dq=at+this+time+their+daily+increasing+numbers+threatened&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIx57H5_eLyAIVDD2SCh18JQQP#v=onepage&q=at%20this%20time%20their%20daily%20increasing%20numbers%20threatened&f=false)ubois.
- Suppression of Indian "Syrian" christian customs by that were in harmony with the surrounding hindu society \[[Olikara1](http://www.nasrani.net/2011/05/19/the-heathen-and-the-syrian-syrian-christian-ritual-and-tradition-pre-1599-a-d/)\] is a good example of the deracination that accompanies strong enforcement of Christian doctrine.
    - Prior to this:
        - They believed that different faiths and religious observances were but different ways of reaching the same God.
        - Their children studied in Hindu schools and children of other faiths studied in our schools too.
        - They held the Hindu philosophies of transmigration of souls and that of fate dear to our hearts.
        - Hindu musicians played in churches during church festivals.
        - They celebrated hindu festivals like Onam.
        - They were indistinguishable in dress and appearance from the heathens.
    - General high status and friendliness:
        - "As a reward for their services, a few Syrian Christian families were given honored privileges in many state rituals by the rulers. In Cochin, Syrian Christian prelates participated in the installation ceremonies of the rulers. During the premier Kerala festival, Onam, part of the regalia for the rituals was stored in a Cochin Syrian Christian church. The procession carrying the Hindu deity, Krishna, at that festival was expected by custom to make a brief stop at the home of a prominent Syrian Christian family who had contributed to the cost of financing that procession. The high status of the Syrian Christians in Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu society was reflected everywhere by their right of access to Hindu shrines and ‘sacred space’. In Alleppey, a newly emerging urban center in Tranvancore, during the eighteenth country, a Hindu temple and a Syrian Christian church were built on adjoining sites, a practice found in the case of older churches and temples in places such as Niranom, Chengannur, Kallopara, and Parur between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Christians continued to use Hindu style torches, umbrellas, and banners at their festivals to honor saints and bishops of the Syrian church. There was at least one Hindu temple that lent its temple elephants for Syrian Christian festival processions." \[Gheverghese [article](http://centreright.in/2012/09/the-syrian-christians-of-kerala-part-1/comment-page-1/#.VLMfADlGjUY)\].
    - Prominent betrayal by Syrian Christians:
        - They welcomed British Christian rule, did not support independence struggle and organized to subvert local hindu hierarchy. \[[TW](https://twitter.com/Madame_Micawber/status/886057335239651332)\]
        - "When Vasco-da-Gama arrived at Cochin on his second voyage (1502) , a delegation of Thomas Christians went to met him and implored protection." \[[Malankara webpage](http://malankaraorthodoxchurch.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=221)\]

  - a temple desecration by unknown persons - [Col](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/pillai/vol01/01_332.pdf)
  


### British rule
- Destroying native education system and impeding its widening reach.
    - See [here](../../../social-cultivation/intellect-sentiment/).
- Aiding missionaries
    - That church is second biggest land owner in india now - is due to brits.
        - As for travancore, brits took away temple lands. Merged with govt holdings. Then gave away huge tracts of lands to xtian organizations. Forced the rAjAs to do so in future as well.
- Anti hindu actions
    - nauTch act, banning firearms, banning sati, banning child marriage
- Strong support for pAkistAn
    - jinnah, punjAb and Joing Christian Board \[[IMG](http://i.imgsafe.org/b63475f8d5.jpg)\].  
            

### Christian charity
- Social and medical work was/ is used by the missionaries to prepare the ground for conversion.
    - Though Christian propaganda may use the following creed to spread "1. Do good to your neighbours. 2. Forgive your enemies. 3. Spread my message all over.", we have noted that Christianity is far more sinister.
- Mother Teresa, the angel from hell
    - Christopher Hitchens [says](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html): "MT was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. ... Many more people are poor and sick because of the life of MT: Even more will be poor and sick if her example is followed. She was a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and a fraud, and a church that officially protects those who violate the innocent has given us another clear sign of where it truly stands on moral and ethical questions."
    - Regarding the abysmal quality of care for her poor patients, we have plenty of testimony from disillusioned volunteers. \[CH's [documentary shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65JxnUW7Wk4#t=382).\] Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as "Houses of the Dying".
        - [Lancet published](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2894%2991759-0/fulltext) a critical account of the care in Mother Teresa's facilities in 1994. [An academic Canadian study](http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html) from a couple of years ago found fault with "her rather dubious way of caring for the sick etc..
    - Baptisms of the dying: In a speech at the Scripps Clinic in California in January 1992, she said: "Something very beautiful... not one has died without receiving the special ticket for St. Peter, as we call it. We call baptism ticket for St. Peter. We ask the person, do you want a blessing by which your sins will be forgiven and you receive God? They have never refused. So 29,000 have died in that one house \[in Kalighat\] from the time we began in 1952."

## Current threat to India and the dharma civilization

- Iconoclasm
    - [Guj16](http://deshgujarat.com/2016/05/13/hindu-murtis-vandalized-in-tribal-dang-district-police-complaint-filed/).

### Subverting hindu society
- [Tracking Evangelism videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfsFDP3OV-AZYx-_8k8Xnjw), Preaching outside temple \[[KK-YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf9uTL8jEV0&feature=share)\].
    - Spreading mechanisms and Hindu idol mutiliation \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dts8rf3Aepk&feature=youtu.be)\].
- Masquerading as dhArmika-s, digestion of hindu practices
    - veda-s and bible - [TOI16](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Desi-Bible-to-have-verses-from-Vedas-Upanishads/articleshow/3330936.cms?utm_source=toimobile&utm_medium=Twitter&utm_campaign=referral&from=mdr).
    - saffron robes
    - Temple imitation
    - Holy Yoga [YT17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJFvcNogFU&feature=youtu.be). (compare with "lord's prayer kata in christian karate" \[[YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4pMONKVSe8)\].
- Underground tactics in case of unfriendly states
    - Lanka \[[A](http://i.imgur.com/k1kyLfa.png)\]
- Connecting nAzi-ism more with hindus and pagans
  - "Nazi icon was *not* a modified version of any Hindu symbol. The Nazi icon was a CHRISTIAN crucification symbol, hooked cross. Hitler doesn’t call it swastika even once in Mein Kampf (https://agiw.fak1.tu-berlin.de/Scriptorium/Zu%20S37/HAMK1943.pdf …) - always Hakenkruis. Calling it Swastika is a Christian whitewash." - {[ST](https://twitter.com/bhAratenduH/status/1013027841691279360)} "Hitler saw Hooked Cross symbol in a Christian monastery (Lambach Abbey)and adopted it as emblem for his party." {[ST](https://twitter.com/TrueIndology/status/1015663967451078657)}

    - "The Bodoland struggle has also become polarised along religious lines, with the [Hindu dominated, Bodo Liberation Tigers Force (BLTF) supporting the security forces against the Christian dominated NDFB](http://books.google.ca/books?id=ApzUuLiO0jYC&pg=PA268&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)[\[1\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn1)" ([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
    - "Under influence of the Christian West, they have tried to de-Indianise their language by forcing people to adopt the Roman script for their language. On 19 August 2000, NDFB killed Bineshwar Brahma, the president of the Bodo Sahitya Academy, for using Devanagari script and refusing to adopt the Roman script for the Bodo language." ([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
- Tripura
    - "The NLFT is accused of forcing Tripura’s indigenous tribes to become Christians and give up Hindu forms of worship in areas under their control. In 1999, they issued a ban on the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja. The [NLFT manifesto](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/717775.stm) says that they want to expand what they describe as the kingdom of God and Christ in Tripura. ... Nagmanlal Halam, secretary of the Noapara Baptist Church in Tripura, was [arrested](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/717775.stm) with a large quantity of explosives. In August 1999, [they kidnapped 4 RSS pracharaks](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Abducted-RSS-men-killed-in-Tripura/articleshow/472452524.cms), held them for ransom, and later, murdered them. ... At least 20 Hindu tribals, including a senior priest of the Jirania Ashram, Santi Kali Maharaj, have been [killed by NLFT](http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/aug/02trip.htm) rebels in the past two years for disobeying orders. ... They also butchered [Hindu Bengali refugees](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1000522/the_east.htm) in cold blood in the Bagber Refugee camp at Bagber in August 2001." ([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)
- nAga-land
    - "One such faction of the NSCN is led by Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah.... Its [manifesto](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/nagaland/terrorist_outfits/nscn_im.htm) is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development and a spiritual outlook — ‘Nagaland for Christ’. ...  The original NNC (Naga Nationalist Council) recognised two religions — Christianity and Naga religions. However, the [NSCN (IM) faction dropped the Naga religion](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_8ylAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=nscn+christian&source=bl&ots=XeDscfObEC&sig=3igrfcVP0qldgichZWPj_7iwvbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ehCfVN-FLdKTyATQ3IGoAw&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=nscn%20christian&f=false) from the list of its recognised religions[\[3\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn3). The very first mission maintained an adversarial relationship with the native Naga faith and when the Christians had increased in sufficient numbers, imposed a no observance of tribal customs and festivals[\[4\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn4). Missionaries forbade consumption of indigenous wine (zam), which according to Vashum was a vital component of their native culture[\[5\]](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/#_edn5), thus imposing their [own version of prohibition](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_8ylAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=nscn+christian&source=bl&ots=XeDscfObEC&sig=3igrfcVP0qldgichZWPj_7iwvbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ehCfVN-FLdKTyATQ3IGoAw&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=nscn%20christian&f=false). The NSCN-K official Wangdong Chaktey has ordered that no Rangsomhum could be constructed in any village of that area. ... British reverend Michael Scott supplied lethal weapons packed in Red Cross boxes to NNC militants. With the help of international Church organisations and foreign NGOs, NSCN (IM) has several support centres in the Netherlands, Thailand, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, South Korea, Australia, England, Philippines, Sweden, Belgium and the US. ... Tikhak Buddhists of Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday observed Buddha Purnima under the vigil of security forces. ...  
        “The people in Wangnong and nearby villages have been passing sleepless nights. They are all Buddhists. An armed militant group belonging to the NSCN(IM) has ordered them to convert to Christianity,” said [Ven Aggadhamma, the highest religious leader of the Buddhists in Changlang and Tirap districts](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/buddhists-allege-nscnim-threat/624612/)."([BODO-2015](http://blogs.swarajyamag.com/2015/01/07/terror-in-the-name-of-christ-in-northeast/).)

- Assam
    - "The Bhuvan Pahar, one of the most holy places in Barak valley of Assam has come under the threat of miscreants for last two months… Gun totting members of a newly formed militant organization, namely, Manmasi National Christian Army (MNCA), comprising about fifteen rebels, has been forcing the Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar, under the threat of gun to convert to Christianity. ...  The problem began when Hmar miscreants stated themselves to be the members of Manmasi National Christian Army and had started putting pressure on the Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar to become Christian. The [local residents informed that Manmasi National Christian Army cadres had painted Cross symbol](http://www.assamtimes.org/node/2986) on the wall of the temples with their blood. ...

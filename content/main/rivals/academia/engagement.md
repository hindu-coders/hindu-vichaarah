title: Hindu Engagement
---


## Principle
- Even if greater disengagement from western indology results in less vigorous study of hindu past in the short term, it will at least be on strong foundations.
- Genuine and honest Hindu/ sanskrit scholarship does not need the shelter of academia to emerge.
    - There are religious institutions, rich circles of connoisseurs form around local experts in the shAstra-s.

## Examples of foolish engagement
- Bad funding: Various idiot rich hindu-s funding sanskrit/ hindu chairs and projects which are liable to be under the influence of anti-hindu academics.
    - Rohan Murthy's funding of [www.murtylibrary.com](http://www.murtylibrary.com/) MCLI .
    - Various endowed chairs and visiting professorships
        - Indian ministry of culture Uchicago 2012 ([UC](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2012/01/24/new-chair-indian-studies-commemorate-hindu-spiritual-leader)).
        - Ramakrishnan Professorship 2016 [UC](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2016/01/26/ramakrishnan-professorship-support-study-sanskrit).
- Acquiescing to sepoy-dom (explained below).

## Possibly better engagement
- Good funding: Fund deserving pro-hindu scholars directly (in India or abroad).
- Drive up awareness about bad Indology and anti-hindu political activism. Make them pay a professional cost. Examples
    - 2016 anti-pollock campaign.
        - rAjiv malhotra's Battle for sanskrit campaign, Anti-pollock petition \[[P](https://www.change.org/p/mr-n-r-narayana-murthy-and-mr-rohan-narayan-murty-removal-of-prof-sheldon-pollock-as-mentor-and-chief-editor-of-murty-classical-library)\], Counter petitions and letters \[[P1](https://www.change.org/p/mr-rohan-narayan-murty-rebuttal-to-removal-of-sheldon-pollock-as-mentor-chief-editor-of-murty-classical-library)\], Petitioners rebuttals \[[RS_BVP](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/7496FVsX3UI/gC6CCjAGJAAJ), [R](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-why-prof-pollock-doesn-t-complain-about-iraq-invasion-but-protests-happenings-in-jnu-prof-ramakrishnan-2185739)\]

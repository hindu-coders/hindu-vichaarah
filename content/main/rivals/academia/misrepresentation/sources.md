title: Misinterpretation causes
---

- Academic arrogance and rigid unwillingness to change wrong opinions.

## The general dry-scholar vs practitioner problem
- "Wanting to appear smart/ score an academic point" types tend to miss the forest for the woods, and (many a time, unfortunately) tend to make others fall into the same pattern. In contrast, a practitioner keeps looking for the \*heart\* of the issue (in the way that affects/ affected practice and the truth). So, this petty desire to show how smart they are motivates the former, not a truly noble desire to attain a sense of Atma+abhyudaya.
    - "Rather they play a game similar to what Aristotle is said to have taught Alexander – eristics – something the Macedonian warrior is said to have enjoyed. In eristics you can successively take either side of an argument and argue for it being the correct one. Similarly, members of this cluster, who are particularly common in elite American academia, can take up a viewpoint and argue for it without really being interested in investigating the truth – seemingly it is an intellectual game for their high IQs. At the long end of history much of this cluster can be seen as making little lasting intellectual contribution beyond creating ferment in their times." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/in-the-gray-zone/)\]
    - This is compounded by the fashion of being deliberately irreverent in their scholarly rhetoric as a way of indicating membership with the mlecCha Indology system.
    - Example: The "ironic" twist to hammIra-kAvya [YT16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPV8CpV1bSc#t=15).
- So, the representation of Hindu traditions by dry scholars tends to be maddeningly flawed (whether in their textbooks, books or talks). Practitioners on the other hand are more reliable. But a \*scholarly practitioner\* is the best. This is the difference between शुष्क-पण्डितता and आर्द्रमना ऋषिः.
    - Analogies: How valuable (to insiders or outsiders) are books about making Indian music or dancing, if written by one who does not do either?
    - Some famous examples of scholar practitioners: [Robert Thurman](https://www.facebook.com/Robert.A.F.Thurman?hc_location=ufi), M Hiriyanna, shatavadhanI gaNesh, [Pandurang Vaman Kane](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pandurang-Vaman-Kane/109228925762949?hc_location=ufi), monastics and scholars associated with n traditional institutions in India and abroad, Dalai Lama.
    - Examples: \[duties vs rights ??\].

- An analysis of western scholar practitioners in Hinduism: fewer scholars openly declare their hindu practice compared to buddhism \[[AC16](https://www.academia.edu/11637543/Asymmetrical_Religious_Commitments_Religious_Practice_Identity_and_Self-Presentation_among_Western_Scholars_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism)\].

### Limitations
- This is not to deny that the labor of the dry-scholars is slightly useful to the scholarly practitioners.
- Misconceptions arising from dry scholarship often need to be countered by similarly dry scholarship.
    - Analogy: You use a thorn to remove a thorn. But why go stepping into a field of thorns (if your intention is to seek a good representation of hindu traditions - say to guide your practice or to compose a textbook)?!! Of course, if your intention is something else, by all means, go find the thorns - just know that what you will find are mostly thorns.
    - Eg. Koenraad Elst's counters to Eaton's negationism on Islamic iconoclasm.

## The nature of the "social sciences" academic establishment
- "They also know that holding (or at least uttering) the required opinions can make or break an academic career: either formally, as when a non-Anglican could not get admission to Oxford University, or informally, as under the reign of progressivist conformism today. To think highly of the academic world presupposes a link between scientific achievement and academic rank, and this largely makes sense in the exact sciences. In the humanities, especially in the social “science” and literature departments, this link is also deduced, but only as a parasitical extension of the conventions in the exact sciences. Much of what passes for scholarship these days is only ideology wrapped into jargon." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

## Inherent flaws in the philological methodology
- the scholar tries to imagine the historical and social context prevelant at the time of composition of a text \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/edQr4IJQuEg?t=428)\]
- rAjIva malhotra says that sheldon pollock and co have invented "political philology" - "A central argument he advocates with evangelical zeal is that Indian texts must be studied not for legitimate spiritual/sacred content, but for the purpose of finding the social exploitation and political domination contained in them. Before he can show the texts to be political, he has to devalue (and debunk) the legitimacy of the sacred dimension; then he can substitute the political motive as the reason for the successful spread of Sanskrit. ...  If one side of the coin of Pollock’s interpretation is political philology, the other side is liberation philology. ... While political philology is used to diagnose, liberation philology is used to liberate the Indian masses from the diseases being carried in their sanskriti for thousands of years." 

## Gross bungling of primary sources
- interpreting them in crazy ways. Eg. Sheldon Pollock \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/vaRCmUwpmNk?t=334)\]

## Severe lack of contextual knowledge
- leading to crazy (yet vehement) extrapolations.
- The typical indologist's evaluation of (even modern, let alone ancient) India can be silly, condescending and demeaning? Just take [this](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-March/042887.html) recent example.

## "Intellectual yet idiot" phenomenon
- More [here](../../iyi/intro/).

## Abrahamist and political sympathies, and the victor writes history phenomenon.
- Examples elsewhere
    - Junipero Serra canonization [G2015](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/pope-grant-sainthood-brutal-missionary).
- The abrahamist scaffolding may be nearly impossible to completely overcome. Example: Mark Dyzchowski ([TW1](https://twitter.com/Vajrakila/status/706496656942891009))
- History of the system
    - "Area Studies began after WWII as a program to encourage university-level training and research (apparently previously largely neglected) into non-Western areas of the world for the purpose of responding to the threat of communist expansion as well as the consequences of the collapse of the British empire and other colonial systems. Starting from 1956, the US government under Title Sixth of the Higher Education Act funds 125 university-based area studies units. UC Berkeley’s South Asia area studies program, for instance, receives $3.5 million/year. In its Cold War form, area studies was intended as an extension of the US foreign policy and the work of both the CIA and the State Department—this is not a conspiracy theory, but commonly acknowledged and debated among scholars themselves. Much of the study of India’s history, religion and present society takes place within South Asia area studies, with its legacy focus on politics, economics, social injustice and conflict." - arumuganAthasvAmin.

## An anti-hindu pro-western civilizational bias.
- Examples from history of mathematics resulting in dismissal, derision: [rAma\_pi\_16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam2rZos5Zo#t=74), [rAma15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh_h2R4mkbc).
- This was starkly evident in the early days: [MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/707818465801986048/photo/1).
- "Orientalist attitude toward India that American academics have inherited from the 19th century European scholars—it’s the working principle that the “natives” are incapable of understanding their own culture as famously explained in Edward Said’s book, Orientalism." - AR.

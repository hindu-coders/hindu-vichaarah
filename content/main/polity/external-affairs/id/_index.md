## Resistance to conversion

The Hindu identity provides some resistance from pressure to convert to Abrahamisms.

- Relatively more successful resistance to Christianity in Manipur (which is 46% Hindu, compared with a small minority in Nagaland \[[History](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/shifting-from-manupur-to-nagaland-christian-missionaries-resisted-by-vaishnavism/)\].

## Reconversion

- Hindu law:
    - Reconversion to the hindu ethos was codified in the devala-smRti \[[PVK_IMG1](https://imgur.com/8ZlWt2a), [TW17](https://twitter.com/vajrayudha11/status/865964633894649856)\] and Vignaneswara’s commentary to Yagyavalkya Smriti \[[S](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/caste-is-hardly-an-impediment-for-homecoming-hindus/)\].
- In Practice:
    - \[Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Culture, by DR Bhandarkar, Rev. JM Anthos, Asian Educational Services, 1989. pp 68.\] quotes an incident in 1398-99 CE during the Vijayanagara era, in which 2,000 Brahmin girls of a village were rescued from the armies of Firoz Shah Bahmani and accepted after purification rites \[1\].
    - "The Shuddhi movement of Arya Samaj, carried to many parts of the north in the early decades of 1900s by Swami Shraddhananda, is nothing but a continuation of this long-time Hindu practice."

## Failure pattern  

- A lack of understanding of the threat the abrahamisms contributed to the lack of common hindu fronts against muslim and other mlecCha invaders.
    
- Yet, some acceptance of abrahamist form and norm might have been a part of the non-military response ([see here](../../../rivals/abe-disease/abe-disease/). )  
    
- Also see [secularism here](../../../../rivals/0-theism/secularism/).

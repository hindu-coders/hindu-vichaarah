## Resistance to conversion

The Hindu identity provides some resistance from pressure to convert to Abrahamisms.

- Relatively more successful resistance to Christianity in Manipur (which is 46% Hindu, compared with a small minority in Nagaland \[[History](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/shifting-from-manupur-to-nagaland-christian-missionaries-resisted-by-vaishnavism/)\].

## Failure pattern  

- A lack of understanding of the threat the abrahamisms contributed to the lack of common hindu fronts against muslim and other mlecCha invaders.
- Yet, some acceptance of abrahamist form and norm might have been a part of the non-military response ([see here](../../../rivals/abe-disease/abe-disease/). )  
- Also see [secularism here](../../../../rivals/0-theism/secularism/).

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF DAMODAR HARI CHAPEKAR  
(FROM BOMBAY POLICE ABSTRACTS OF 1910, PAGES 50 TO 107.)

## PREFACE
### MY OBJECT IN WRITING (MY) AUTOBIOGRAPHY
My countrymen, for a long time I have been actuated by a desire to commit to writing, in the
form of a treatise, my experiences, good and bad, of life, from the time of my birth. But whenever
that thought occurred to me, it was accompanied by a consciousness that any incidents, to be
embodied in a treatise, must be of a singularly marvellous or unprecedented character. In the
absence of these characteristics, the treatise will be of no interest. For, a consideration of the matter makes it obvious that every being that is born must pass through some good or bad experiences
before it ceases to exist. If the story of one's life does not contain anything that is not to be found in the lives of the generality of men, if the perusal of one's good or bad career does not arouse in the minds of the people any feeling of pleasure or pain, or, if one's righteous conduct is barren in its effect in inculcating a wholesome moral or in gratifying the public taste, then of what avail is such a treatise ? What is the use of a needless waste of time (in writing it) ?

The aim of a man's life should
be the accomplishment of such righteous deeds as would engage the pens of several authors in
describing them. Blessed is that righteous man to versify whose career in befitting metre several
eminent poets, with their pen poised upon their ears, will, while seated in solitude, be gazing
heaven-ward, as if to invoke the goddess of learning !+++(5)+++ His blessedness is indeed beyond
description. The biographies of such personages tend to save, while those of others to destroy,
mankind. In short, in such cases (alone) is the object of one's existence attained. Otherwise, is not
the writing of an autobiography like making a display of one's own wisdom or waving a lighted lamp
around one's own head ? On the other hand, if there be any fascinating episodes in a man's life
unknown and likely to remain unknown to the public, these also may be (embodied in an
autobiography). But as neither of these two tests is applicable to me I have not been able till now to
fulfil my desire to write an autobiography. From these cogitations the wise would be able to gather,
without being told so explicitly, that the desirability of writing the story of my life did not commend itself to me.

### WHAT THE LEARNED SAY ?
Now let us consider the opinions of the ancients as well as of the moderns in regards to this
matter, and then we might follow the adage " Hear all (but) act according to (your) own inclination."
First of all let us consult the learned men of the present day who have received an English
education. By consulting them I do not mean that we are to go to their houses or to invite them to
ours and then to ask that body of learned men their opinion in regard to this commonplace matter.
The wise would readily understand that what I mean is only to ascertain from the conduct, the
writings or the speeches of those universally respected men whether my undertaking has their
approval. Some days back I was at Meru Jalgaon, a village in Khandesh. While there, in the usual
course of my reading various ancient and modern books at the (local) library, I came across a
modern work entitled " Sansaramargopadeshika,"+++(5)+++ wherein good advice is given as to how
householders should conduct themselves. The whole of this advice is not the author's own, but in
several places (quotations from the work of) great men are given in support of the writer's opinions,
And, therefore, those maxims, are, I think, worthy of acceptance. While reading that book from beginning to end, I came across the author's own views
regarding the present subject in one place. He says that a man should, during his leisure hours,
write the story of his life, whether it be good or bad and should invest it with interest by describing
various places, times and habitations.+++(5)+++ Particular care should be taken to avoid the use of
vulgarisms, and the harmonious arrangement of the subject dealt with, should not be disregarded.
This kind of writing becomes the means of endowing the writer with literary skill, intellectual capacity
and elegance of speech. It also becomes the means of acquainting future generations with our
careers, and of enabling them to form a correct estimate of our character, the rectitude or otherwise
of our conduct, and the truth or falsity of the accusations against us. 

Let this, however, pass. From
what the author of the aforesaid book says it may be inferred that men of the present time approve
of this course. There are many other instances of similar approval, but I lay them aside as they
would cover considerable space, and as there exists a great difference between my views and the
opinions of these self-styled learned men. But of what worth am I ? I am only an insignificant
individual among those ignorant men who are to be found in this vast world. There is however, a
heaven-wide difference between the views of our modern scholars and those of Vyas, Valmiki,
Parashara, Manu and other great Rishis and founders of religion, who are counted amongst men of
transcendent intellect, whose works, such as the Shrutis and the Smrities, have gained the
acceptance of the people continually for several ages and who are looked upon as incarnations of
the Deity. That is to say, they are sceptical as to (the soundness of the dicta of) these great men.
These blockheads, who call themselves learned, seem to entertain doubts as to the existence of
that Supreme Being who has created the universe, by whose power it is regulated, whose grace
brings happiness and whose displeasure misery to mankind, and who is called the Adi Narayan in
our religious books. What more need be said and what more is required ? Why should we then
accept even this view which has emanated from the detestable minds of such vile atheists ? As I
have a great faith in the ancients, I shall first ascertain their views and then determine whether I am
fitted to write my autobiography. 

But wait. My readers might here raise a question as to why I had
taken even one instance from the learned men of the present day, if these were not acceptable to
me. Old opinions only ought to have been followed. Yes, readers, what you say is true. But it is a
principle of ethics that if any question is to be considered, all, whether ignorant or wise, young or
old, poor or rich, should join in discussing it. As there is no saying in what way God may inspire any
one, a wise man, without considering (any distinctions) of wealth, knowledge or age, should, after
hearing the opinions of all, do only what is right. In view of this rule of conduct, I have drawn these
distinguished scholars on my side.

### WHAT THE REVERED ANCESTORS SAY?
Let us now see what our revered ancestors have to say. With the object of learning the views
of the ancients I have read a large number of ancient works.+++(4)+++ I nowhere came across any clear
statement in those works to the effect that every man should write his autobiography with his own
hand. As, however, those great men spent their precious time and took great pains in writing a
detailed account of themselves, whether good or bad, there is no objection in presuming that this
course commended itself to them. Here my readers might perhaps say : " As they were great, it
became, them. Their achievements were also great and their' talents deserved to be memorised. If
they themselves had not written their own histories, many would have assiduously laboured to write
them. Because those warriors and statesmen wrote, should even an imbecile, who has not wit
enough to manage his domestic affairs, write a story of his feeble life ?" My friends, I hold the same opinion as you do, viz., that only great men should write their autobiographies,

### INSTANCES FROM HISTORY
But the autobiography written by the accomplished statesman Nana Phadanvis and the
accounts of themselves chronicled by such great personages as Ahalyabai and Alexander (the
Great), clearly indicate their inward conduct and inward disposition as well as the tendency of their
minds. Alexander had specially engaged a chronicler to write his history, and during his leisure
hours he used to make him read it out in his own presence.+++(5)+++ Those passages, however, in which the
impartial chronicler had found fault with Alexander would move him to great wrath, while those in
which he was eulogized would please him. So also Ahalyabai used to make a scribe write an
account of herself and read it out to her. She, however, would get angry with the clerk on hearing
those passages in which she was praised by the writer.+++(5)+++ The difference between the woman
(Ahalyabai) and the man (Alexander) would be quite apparent to any sensible man from the above
facts. Nana Phadanvis also has written a faithful and detailed account of himself from his childhood
to old age, wherein he notes even his loathsome acts. A perusal of these might stem to render his
outward conduct reprehensible. But I feel sure that sensible people, instead of attaching any blame
to him, would only extol him for his candour. On considering all these facts it would appear that
great men have followed the practice of writing the stories of their own lives.

### WHAT ABOUT COMMON PEOPLE ?
Now it is undeniable that common people should not waste their precious time in writing
autobiographies. And even if they write any, these autobiographies being devoid of any
extraordinary incidents, would fail to commend themselves to popular appreciation. Like thousands
of other creatures, they came into existence and passed away. What was unusual in this ? In short,
if an autobiography is not read, the labour expended in writing it would be fruitless. A man would do
well to consider this fact before undertaking any such task.

### TWO WAYS OF ACQUIRING FAME
There are two ways in which a man can acquire fame namely, by committing a reprehensible
deed or by performing a very laudable act. Ravana, Duryodhana and other very wicked persons
acquired splendid notoriety only by seizing the wealth (or) wives of others. So, Ramaraj and
Dharmaraj, by following a career of rectitude as laid down in our sacred books, have achieved ever-
lasting glory.

These examples, however, are of very remote antiquity. But in quite recent times both
bad and good men have acquired fame in history. To the former category belong Muhammad
Taghlak and other Muhammadan kings, who amused themselves by frying human beings in pans,
and Malharao and Bajirao II who brought about their own downfall by ravishing the wives of others +++(4)+++.
To the latter category belong Akbar, Shivaji Maharaj, Bajirao I and others. Men like Valya Koli were
saved though they committed great sins. From this it appears that to acquire fame, one must
execute one's undertaking, be it good or bad. (One should do) either an extremely good or an
extremely bad act.

### MY ASPIRATION
Now, in concluding this lengthy discussion, I disclose my views. Friends, all things
considered, it is the dictate of my conscience that I should write an autobiography. Here it is
necessary for me to. tell my friends whether I am justified in doing so. But having regard to the
present time (I think) it would be inadvisable to refer to the matter in explicit terms. I, therefore, content myself by saying that I, your friend, intend to put my hand to great deed after some days, and I am
sure that before and after I have put my hand to it I shall have to forego all happiness and to
undergo diverse sufferings. For, can it ever be said that if one placed his foot upon fire it will not be
scorched ? No. It is probable, therefore, that like the victim of sacrificial rites, I shall be consumed in
the furnace of fire into which I am going to plunge. Perhaps God in His mercy may extricate me from
all difficulties and vouchsafe fame to me, as that Supreme Soul rescued Pralhad from burning fire
by cooling its flames and made him renowned.

### WHY I UNDERTAKE A TERRIBLE DEED
Now, the question arises, why should such a murderous and terrible deed be undertaken ?
Yes, brethren, here also I shall compare myself to Prahlad. Just as Prahlad worshipped the
Almighty with boundless devotion, so my love for my country is unwavering, in other words, it is
undying. This obviously means that I am a thorough patriot. I shall relinquish all happiness and
sacrifice my life for my country. The wise may draw their own inferences from this. I do not say
anything further anent this matter. He who undertakes a task of such magnitude must be involved in
various difficulties, from which he can only be extricated by the grace of God. Hence a life so full of
joy and sorrow as mine will probably be interesting to the public mind in some measure at least.
Besides, there is another reason why I desire to write (an autobiography).

### LESSON OF MY LIFE.
When the public will read, in a detailed story of my life, how I commenced my undertaking,
what was its middle state, how it terminated or what (other) fate overtook it in the end and similar
other matters, I hope that those patriotic friends who will come after me will take care to avoid the
mistakes I may have committed and achieve their aims. Readers, I leave it to you to judge, from the
above discussion of the reasons for and against my undertaking the task and from my firm resolve
(to sacrifice myself) for the good of my country, whether the course which I have adopted of writing
(an autobiography) is right or wrong. Now I follow this course because I consider it good and proper.
But before doing so I, your most humble friend, very respectfully request you that if, perchance, this
undertaking of mine be against your views, that is to say, if you disapprove it, you will, bearing in
mind the maxim " There are as many characters as there are forms," consider it natural that all men
should differ in their opinions, and pardon me. With these remarks only I take my leave of you.

I am, yours,  
Well-wisher of the country,  
DAMODAR HARI CHAPEKAR ,  
Patriot.

## Grandfather's guidance
### DETERMINATION OF THE TIME OF BIRTH
At 3 ghatikas after sunrise on Friday, partly first and partly second day of the dark half of the
month of Jyeshtha, hot season dakshinayana, Shak year, 1791, called Shukla, and under the Karka
Lagna and the Purvashada-nakshatra, Phaladevasharma belonging to the Manushyagan (was
born).

### MY FAMILY
I was born at the village of Chinchwad. My family was rich at the time I was born, but its
wealth began to vanish as I grew up. This may be ascribed either to my ill-luck or to the
adverseness of the times. For we daily see great men fall from their high estate and vice versa in the extraordinary transformations effected by
the Almighty. Why may it not be said, then, that the depressed state to which my family was
reduced was brought about by the same law of nature ? My grandfather's name was Vinayak, the
names of my father, myself and my mother being, respectively, Hari, Damodar and Dwarka. My
grandfather was a great lover of independence. He, therefore, did not accept service, which means
subjection to others, though he was a man of ability.+++(4)+++ This is the fruit of knowledge. But now-a-days a
state of subjection is liked by the people to such an extent that he alone is considered a talented
man who (instead of) devoting his vast knowledge acquired by life long labour in serving the people
accepts the service (of Government).+++(5)+++ This also must be attributed to the influence of adverse times.

There is an adage to the effect that agriculture is the best (of professions), trade the middle one,
and service the lowest.+++(4)+++ It is on account of the freedom which is its outcome that agriculture has
been assigned the foremost place amongst the three professions ranged in the above order. But
now-a-days agriculture is looked down upon as a mean profession. It thus follows that all things,
moveable and immoveable, the ignorant and the learned, the poor and the rich, nay, even all beings
from the ant to Brahma, are affected in an equal degree by the unfavourable turn of the wheel of
time. My liberty-loving grandfather was stigmatized by the people as a man who squandered as he
liked the savings of his father and led a life of indolent ease. At one time he would lay out a garden
and water it with a copper-moat, at another time he would start a dispensary and distribute
medicines gratis.+++(4)+++ These doings of his, though good in themselves, subjected him to the censure of
the people. Some said that he had not wit enough for service.+++(5)+++ With a view to free himself from such
calumnious gossip, my grandfather passed examination and was appointed to a post of Rs. 60 per
mensem in some department at Kolhapur. He served there for about two or three months, and
having thus exhibited the flame of his knowledge to the ignorant, he again turned his back upon that
state of bondage and directed his attention to independent vocations. But the adage that when Fate
is adverse even a hundred attempts fail, is not untrue. Now, my grandfather engaged himself in all
sorts of occupations , he even started a grocer's shop, a printing press, a sweetmeat stall, and a
loom. He tried his hand at things too many to mention, but fortune being unfavourable, they all
proved fruitless. Our family consisted of about twenty members, including my six uncles, two aunts,
two grandmothers and other relatives.

### PILGRIMAGE TO BENARES
My grandfather was a whimsical person, that is to say, he insisted on doing whatever he once
took a fancy to. Either owing to this whimsical disposition of his, or through extreme vexation at
being thwarted by fate in all his undertakings, he at one time took it into his head to go on pilgrimage
to Benares with his family. On that occasion the people of the village and his friends and
acquaintances tried much to dissuade him from doing so, but their advice was without avail in
consequence of the above-mentioned obstinacy of his disposition. When we started on a pilgrimage
to Kashi, we were twenty-five persons in all, besides two male servants and three carts. I was about
five or six years old at this time. Being then so very young, I do not recollect any incidents of the
journey worth mentioning. The death of my elder sister, aged about nine years, at Gwalior is the
principal event I remember.+++(4)+++ Having said so much, I quit this topic and proceed to describe what
followed the pilgrimage. We returned home after completing the pilgrimage to Benares after nine or
ten months. In the opinion of some, this pilgrimage to Benares was the chief cause of our poverty.
But I do not at all agree in this opinion. I do not, therefore, consider these men as well informed,
though they may have a knowledge of worldly matters. In my tender years I had an opportunity
959of drinking the water of the Ganges, bathing in it, and giving alms and of seeing and touching (the image of) Kashivishveshwara.+++(4)+++ For this I feel profoundly grateful to my grandfather.

### I WAS SENT TO SCHOOL
After our return to our native country from the pilgrimage, I was sent to a school at Chinchwad
for my education. I have already said that my grandfather loved liberty. He educated all his children
in a manner consonant with his wilful disposition. My father learnt English at the Poona High School.
After he had nearly completed the sixth standard, a Shastri was engaged to teach him Sanskrit at
home, and in order that my father might have a companion in his studies, a Brahmin friend of his
own age was selected for that purpose.+++(4)+++ My grandfaher's intellect was so keen that he became
proficient in Sanskrit by simply hearing the lessons given by the Shastri to my father every morning.
The chief object of teaching Sanskrit to his eldest son was that by initiating him in the profession of
performing kirtan, which besides being an independent one, was also conducive to one's material
as well as spiritual good, all the members of the family might in contentment partake in the simple
fare he might earn and say " Hari, Hari," at their ease. How ingenuous were these views ! It was in
harmony with these views that he began to teach one of his sons to play on the pakhwaj and two
others on the sarangi and two others to sing. He was actuated by a desire that (his son's) katha
should be as unrivalled as that of the famous Trimbakboa of Nasik.

### MY FATHER TAKES TO KIRTAN
After my father had completed his Sanskrit education, he began to receive instruction in the
art of performing kirtan. But all the accessories of a kirtan, viz., the most fascinating legends and the
most melodious poetry in Saki, Dindi, Pad, Arya and Ovi metres could not be got from other
Haridases. He, therefore, himself composed verses and fascinating legends and my father began to
use them in his kirtan. The first kirtan was performed in our own house. As my father was naturally
endowed with humorous speech, some persons on hearing the first kirtan prophesied tnat he was
destined to excel as a kirtan performer. As we belonged to an ancient lay family, our caste-men and
friends did not like to see my father adopt the profession of Haridas.+++(4)+++ Nay, even none of our family
except my grandfather liked it. But what could they do ? No one dared utter a single word in the
presence of my grandfather. But whenever he praised the profession the members of our family
never failed to show their disapproval of it by turning up their noses and knitting their brows. This
was also due to the influence of adverse times. For, as is said by (the poet) Mayurpant in an Arya
line, " Far better is hell : dependence is a hundred times more harassing" which means that hell is a
hundred times better than dependence. Though service is so despicable, it is held in high esteem in
the nineteenth century. May it not be said that this also is an instance of the singular influence of the
times ?

### THE FAMILY BREAKS UP
As all the members of our family viewed the said profession with disfavour my uncles soon
ceased to assist (my father in) kirtan performances, and each (of them) having selected his own
profession went away where he liked. My far-sighted grandfather (also) left for some distant land
when he saw this break up of our family and the gradual withdrawal of the goddess of wealth from
our midst and for (the next) thirteen years he did not show his face again in his native country. How
curious it is that ever since then up till now, all of us have been wandering in different lands in
pursuit of different occupations. Some of us are happy while others live in misery. Strangely enough, out of all of us,
my eldest uncle, viz., my father's next younger brother alone, remained at home with his family. It
appears that it was not his destiny to be a wanderer. But this circumstance does not warrant the
inference that he tasted happiness by thus remaining at home. On several occasions he had to
starve. I am altogether against staying at home under such circumstances. During these hard times
we were travelling about the province of Nemad.

### GRANDFATHER'S HARDSHIPS
My grandfather had settled down at Indore and there he earned a living by penmanship. He
wrote an excellent Balbodh and Modi hand. (Even) now there can be seen in every house at Indore
manuscripts written by him. These are his memorials raised by himself. It is strange that time brings
about a wonderful change in the nature of man as in that of everything else. Neither his character
nor his intellectual powers nor his appearance can remain the same for all time. In obedience to that
law, this individual (i.e., my grandfather) possessed many attributes worthy of being imitated. He
had now made it a rule not to speak in the Prakrit tongue.+++(4)+++ He dressed in any way he liked and ate
anything. He relinquished, as far as possible, all intercourse with men. In short, he did not believe
that any duty of his had remained unperformed. Is it conceivable that the descendants of a great
man whose transactions extended over lakhs of rupees, who had given away thousands in charity in
his palmy days, should be compelled, during his lifetime, and before the eyes of his relations and
friends, to beg for alms with a wallet slung from the shoulder, or with a beggar's bowl in hand, in
such capital town as Indore and Dhar. But this cannot be helped. Strange indeed are the decrees of
fate ! Well, but did my grandfather ever feel mortified because he had to do such mean things ? No,
never !+++(4)+++ This was due to the serenity of his temper. He was proud of himself for suiting his actions to
the times. What reason was there for him, then, to feel ashamed ? Such actions, however, filled
others with shame. I and my younger brother were of too tender an age to understand anything
then.

### WE FACED POVERTY
While we were in such straitened circumstances, my thread ceremony and the the marriage
of.....................(Blank in the original) were celebrated with difficulty by expending a small sum of
money. Sometimes the male members of our family secretly took their food at the Annasatra. We
too used to be secretly taken there, but with a warning not to disclose the fact to any one. We were
told that in case of our being questioned, we should name (some other) place.+++(4)+++ Alas ! even now,
when I remember those loving words spoken by them during such hard times, they fill my mind with
sadness. In short, during adverse times, it becomes extremely difficult to protect one's family and
honour without money. It is true that all the members of my family greatly regret that they (were
compelled to have recourse to) such unbecoming shifts to appease (the pangs of) hunger. I,
however, not only do not regret these occurrences, but on the contrary contemplate with a feeling of
pride that the Chapekars, though beset with such difficulties, did not even care to seek the help of
their well-to-do relatives and friends, but that, as suited their unbending haughtiness, they tided over
those (hard) times by simply uttering the name of God and without sacrificing their independence or
accepting bondage. Though we begged for alms, we never entered the houses of people for that
purpose nor did we persist in our importunity until pushed out.+++(4)+++ Why should we, therefore, be
ashamed of this ? Even now I will adopt the same course if similar calamities overtake me. For
begging is a hundred times better than subjection to others. Let that pass. On twenty-five occasions in about one year we were compelled to have recourse to begging. Since that
time, however, up till now, that is to say, for the last fourteen or fifteen years, we have not been
obliged to resort to it. Let that (too) pass.

### DEATH OF MY GRANDFATHER
My grandfather, who possessed a spirit which remained imperturbed both in times of
happiness and misery, passed away on the...............(Blank in the original). He suffered from
dysentery during his last days. He always prayed to God that he might die of dysentery, because a
man suffering from that disorder retains his senses till his last moment and is thus enabled to utter
the name of God (to the last). By the grace of God, my grandfather died of dysentery as he had
wished. His throat having become choked by phlegm during his last moment, he found it difficult to
utter God's name, and therefore he wrote down on a slate as follows : " It is certain that I am dying,
but it will be better if you give me abhrakbhasrr.a (A kind of native medicine) to remove the phelgm
sticking in my throat, as it obstructs the utterance of the name of God." Accordingly my uncle made
him take that powder, and a short time later he left this world for the next one. His dead body was
consigned to the waters of the river Kshipra, which is sixteen miles from Indore. He died the very
day on which he took Sanyas.+++(4)+++ I was at Nagpur with my father and mother when this sad event
happened. We were informed by wire of the critical condition of my grandfather two days before his
death, but we were unable to have a last look at him on account of the many inconveniences which
came in our way. This circumstance deeply grieved us, especially my father. But it was of no avail.
We could not go, as we were helpless in the matter. Nagpur must be about a thousand miles from
Indore. The first great difficulty in our way for going over such a long distance was (the money
wherewith to pay our) fare, and this, in conjunction with other difficulties, prevented us from paying
our last respects to my grandfather. It was so ordained by God. My grandmother too (died) under
similar circumstances, that is to say, none of us were present during her last hours. We are taken to
task for this by some of our friends and relatives, who do not take into consideration the insuperable
difficulties which prevented us from visiting my grandfather and grandmother in their last hours. Let
that, however, pass.

## Father's profession
### ALL DUE TO POVERTY
I have already said that the adoption by my father of the profession of Haridas commended
itself to the approval only of my father and grandfather, but not of any other (member of our family).
Hence of course it cannot be said that a man will satisfactorily do anything in which he feels no
interest. Even during my grandfather's lifetime, some of my uncles behaved in a self-willed manner.
One of them joined a dramatic company, another began to learn to sing, another learnt to play on a
tambora and another became a vagrant. The saying " Men without money care nothing for one
another " is not untrue. I am sure that had my grandfather possessed even a small sum of money,
this dispersion would not have taken place.+++(4)+++ This is quite obvious, (for) if my grandfather had (any)
money he would not have left his own house and gone to Indore. When one is without money,
unexpected calamities befall him. Brothers quarrel with him ; relatives and friends keep at a distance
from him ; he is not honoured by men of position ; nay, he loses credit even with his own wife, that is
to say, even she insults him, unheard of accusations are levelled at him, and they are believed
simply because of his extreme poverty.+++(5)+++ These are the consequences of the displeasure of the
Goddess of wealth. 

But if the same goddess be propitious, even enemies will become friends. A
poet had said, " Relatives gather in the house wherein riches in a large measure find
their way." When a man is prosperous people seek his acquaintance, claim relationship with him
and force themselves upon him. Great scholars honour him in assemblies by calling him Rao Saheb
and Kaka Saheb, his wife places a stool in ten different places (to suit his humour). If rich men
commit any number of unjust acts, they are deemed to be just ones and their authors are praised by
the people. Hence in this world no one is so greatly esteemed by the people as a wealthy man. In
short, my uncles only followed the way of the world by becoming disunited It is needless to say that
having left their father in adversity they lived separate also from their eldest brother, namely, my
father.
### MY FATHER'S DIFFICULTIES
Then the profession of performing kathas which had been adopted by my father ceased to be
as lucrative as it ought to have been. It is clear that a speaker cannot alone divert an audience
composed of men of different tastes. Again, as my father had recently begun to perform kathas, it
was necessary for him to have all the necessary appliances. But there was no remedy. The
members of his family were of the character already described. Thinking that if paid outsiders were
engaged it would be difficult to defray the cost of the establishment, my father took service at
Sholapur for some days. But whether as a singular coincidence or because it was not in his destiny
to earn a living by service, he used to fall ill whenever he resumed his duties. While at Sholapur he
suffered severely from (pl?)ague. At last he relinquished service and again betook himself to performing
kirtans. At this time I undertook to act as his assistant by standing behind him and beating the tal. At
this time I was nine or ten years of age. My uncle Rambhau, who was my father's younger brother
and whom I called Dada, used to assist (him) by playing on pakhawaj, but in a few days he too went
away. In the end we two brothers only, namely, my brother, Balkrishna and myself, proved
serviceable (to our father) as his helpmates. We were then quite young. The musical and melodious
padas sung by us in our juvenile voices used to gladden the minds of the audience. A few days
afterwards I learnt to play on the harmonium and my younger brother, Balkrishna, became proficient
in playing on Sarmandal (a stringed instrument of music ; a sort of hurdygurdy). Our youngest
brother, Wasudev, used to stand behind us to beat the tal and to enchant the audience with his
sweet voice.

## Education
### WE TOOK TO KIRTAN AS A PROFESSION
Thus our company being composed only of the members of our family, who were zealous in
promoting the common interest, was now much admired by the public. It is now about twelve years
since we adopted the performance of kathas as our permanent profession. Each one of us has now
become perfectly proficient in the art. Everywhere praises are showered on our musical
performance and on the excellence of our father's kirtan. Now at last, some people on hearing my
father's kirtan remember the late Trimbakboa of Nasik. As our profession was not like that of a
vendor who can sell his goods while permanently residing at any one place, my father's good
company opened up to me two principal means of acquiring knowledge, namely, a constant hearing
of kirtans and travelling over the country. A poet has truly said, " By travelling in (different) countries
a man gains the friendship of scholars, admittance into assemblies, knowledge of scientific books
and great astuteness." It is immaterial even if one keeps a stall, provided it be for selling flowers.
Accordingly, though we followed the profession of performing kirtans as a means of earning our
livelihood, I derived from it the benefit of hearing
God's name (recited) and also all the benefits enumerated in the verse quoted above. Travelling
over the country, hearing bon-mots, witnessing darbars held by great princes, seeing assemblies of
eminent scholars, visiting holy shrines and deities—these and several other benefits were derived
by me without any trouble, for which I am greatly indebted to my father and chiefly to the Almighty
who is the regulator of the universe.+++(5)+++ Compared with all the benefits mentioned above, the ever-
lasting benefit of knowledge is indeed unique. The idea that true knowledge can be acquired by
study or by attending a school or by passing two or three examinations is, in my opinion, entirely
erroneous.+++(5)+++ I have come across the following verse which corroborates the above assertion made by
me : " Fools remain fools even after studying the sciences."+++(5)+++ That man is learned indeed who
performs the various duties prescribed by the Shastras. I have seen hundreds, nay thousands, of
learned men who, though proficient in more sciences than one, are addicted to evil habits. Of what
use is their learning ? Fie upon their learning and their study ! That man alone is learned who
performs the duties laid down in the Shastras.

### I RECEIVED VERY MEAGRE EDUCATION
As I was obliged to be constantly travelling, I had no opportunity of attending any school and
acquiring proficiency in English. I, however, learnt the first two English standards in the New English
School, Poona. So strange is the influence of the study of English that if one simply intends to learn
that language, or if a child learns by heart only the first two or three letters of its alphabet, he begins
at once to look upon his elders as fools and despises his good and ancient religion.+++(5)+++ If the mere
odour of English education has this effect, where is the wonder if any righteous person who fully
tastes it should turn an Englishman from top to toe and an earnest votary of the bottle ? The only
matter for congratulation is that in spite of my study of English, limited though it was, no change
whatever took place in my temper by the grace of God.+++(5)+++ It is very gratifying to me to say this. I am
convinced that though I were to learn English to any extent, or read any number of books in that
language, or hear any number of lectures or mix (with Englishmen) to any extent, I shall never be
imbued with any ideas inconsistent in the slightest degree with our ancient religion which has
(almost) ceased to be followed. May God (enable me to) stick to my resolution as long as I live ! I
attended school for a very few days, that is to say, scarcely for seven or eight months. I was in the
third standard class in the New Marathi School (Poona) for four months. I studied Marathi only up to
the third standard.. My father had taught me the First English Book at home. I studied the Second
Book for four months in the New English School, but having in the mean time imbibed a dislike for
the English language left off studying it. The fact of being always on the move also interfered with
my regular attendance at the school. But, in my opinion, this was not the true impediment which
came in the way of my education. Everybody said to my father, " Since the time you took your son
into this profession (of yours), his studies have been seriously interfered with. Do your best to send
him to school." How great is the delusion under which men labour ! Neither travel nor this profession
can come in the way of one who has made up his mind to educate himself. A little consideration (will
make it evident) that as that performance took up (only) three hours of our time at night and as that
performance did not take place every day, there was ample time for one who was bent upon study.
Now take travelling. It is absurd to allege that travelling interferes with one's education, because a
school is not the only place for acquiring knowledge. Had I the inclination to prosecute my studies,
my revered father, who is well versed in English, Marathi and Sanskrit languages, would have
willingly taught both myself and my brother.+++(4)+++ In short, the dislike for that kind of education on the part
of my brother and myself was the chief reason (why we remained ignorant).

My father wished to teach us a profession that would enable us to earn our livelihood in
independence, that is to say, without nattering other people. He does not desire that we should earn
our living by becoming proficient as kirtan-performers, nor do we wish to follow that vocation, as
neither of us entertains any regard for it. I, however, admit that there is nothing so interesting as a kirtan.

### STUDY OF MEDICINES
Our father, therefore, after fully considering the matter, commenced to teach us medicine.
This profession can, without any objection, be regarded as an independent one. Because every
sufferer from colic or any other malady must need seek (the help of) a physician. There is scarcely
any other profession which can, like this one, be practised without leaving one's home. A poet
speaks about this profession as follows ; " Gandhari becomes fruitful for the time being (but) the
astrologer and the physician earn money without intermission." For some days we vigorously
prosecuted our studies in the science which our father had after (due) consideration begun to teach
us. We learnt by rote about 500 shlokas from medical works. We also finished Amarkosha, Rupavali
and some cantos from Raghuvamsha. I was about 13 or 14 years of age at this time. Our father
tried his utmost to make us proficient in the science. 

Men are, however, during their early days
careless and free from anxiety (as to the future) and so they do not at all understand the value of
education. We too possessed this characteristic to a large extent. But apart from this, there was
another cause in operation which, besides retarding our studies, deviated our attention completely
from these matters, which, whether good or otherwise from our point of view, enable a man to
acquire fame in these days. Even though that cause is of a most secret character, I mean to make a
fearless statement about it in this place as it has prompted me to write this autobiography, and also
to mention the events to which it has given rise from time to time. That Almighty, who is the
supporting pillar of our Aryan religion, and whom we always implore by repeating His innumerable
epithets and who from time to time takes a new birth (to regenerate) the decaying Hindu Religion.

### AN ACCOUNT OF US, TWO BROTHERS
" A Yogabhrashsta individual takes birth in the house of a holy and wealthy men.
There he regains the discipline which his mind had undergone in a former existence."
In our youth, we two brothers travelled a great deal with our father with the object of
performing kirtan. In the course of our travels, while we were proceeding by train to Rajpur, a town
beyond Nagpur, we saw the mountainous region thickly covered with trees through which we had to
pass. I have still a vivid recollection of the effect which this sight produced on my mind. Just as
some trivial incident strikes us with wonder at the resuscitation of an object which has long faded
from our memory, so the sight of that mountainous tract suddenly gave rise in our minds to the
thought that the place was admirably suited for refuse after the perpetration of terrible deeds. Since
then we began to meditate upon such terrible deeds. At this time our respective ages were probably
15 and 12 years. In this wise came about the awakening of our minds. One has some reason for
entertaining feelings of hatred towards another, but when we try to trace the origin of our hatred towards the English, we fail to recollect any incident in this life
calculated to arouse it. Hence it may be said that, the origin of the thought which rose up within us
that the English were our implicable enemies and engrossed our untutored minds in our childhood,
is to be found in the sacred shloka of the Bhagwatgita quoted above. As I feel ashamed to recall the
puerile thoughts of our childhood I do not propose to refer to them here except in two instances
wherein they were realised.+++(4)+++ We knew that physical strength and a sufficiency of men were
indispensable for overpowering and expelling the powerful brigand and pretender who had entered
and taken possession of our house. Of the various thoughts of our childhood, these two only which
were truly momentous survived the destruction that overtook the rest and continued to actuate our
minds to the last. Recognising the value of a strong physique from our childhood, we two brothers
exerted ourselves day and night to acquire it. With a view to educate us in Sanskrit, our father
began to teach us Amar-kosh, Rupavali, Raghu, Kirat and other poems, and considering that the
medical profession enables one to earn an independent living, he began to instruct us in medical
science. Whatever progress we made in our studies was confined to our childhood and was
ascribable to the fear inspired by our father.

### EFFORTS FOR INCREASING BODILY STRENGTH
But as our minds subsequently began to follow their own bent in regard to the object in view,
we naturally neglected our studies and thus suffered in the estimation of our father. First we directed
our efforts to the acquisition of bodily strength. We began to accustom ourselves to the jor and
baithak exercises. But these practices were brought to the notice of our father, who used to get very
angry with us. On several occasions he even burnt our langots.+++(4)+++ Finding that our father disapproved
of this matter we changed our mode of exercise by substituting prostrations in worship of the Sun for
jor and baithak.+++(5)+++ This being a religious practice he could not offer any opposition to it, but when our
prostrations reached twelve hundred, he began to grumble, saying, " How many prostrations are to
be made ? Is there no limit to them ? " We paid no particular attention to this grumbling, but made
vigorous efforts to improve our physique. Later on my brother, Balkrishna alias Bapurao, devoted
himself particularly to gymnastic exercises such as wrestling, etc. But I devoted myself to running
and making prostrations by way of exercise.+++(5)+++ I brought up the number of prostrations performed at a
stretch to twelve hundred and the number of miles covered in an hour in running to eleven.+++(5)+++ My
brother was superior to me in physical strength. During my stay in Poona I used to get up at 5
O'clock in the morning and commenced running before the people were up and astir. I used to run
up to the Kirkee Station and back via Lakdipul. Sometimes I used to go also to Chinchwad, which,
via Kirkee, is at a distance of eleven miles from Poona. As we thus used to take exercise secretly
the matter did not come to the knowledge of the public, but from our physiques it was observable
that we were proud of our bodily strength. Consequently many of our Brahmin friends in Poona who
were our equals in age began to hate us secretly, but we generously took no notice whatever of this.+++(5)+++
We, however, held ourselves always in readiness, thinking that it was incumbent upon us to quench
the fire to their hatred, should it begin to burn us. Occasionally quarrels did take place between us,
but as they were of a trivial character, I pass over them here. God blessed us with parents suited to
our haughty temperament, or it may more aptly be said that the law of heredity planted in us inborn
haughtiness.

### MY FATHER'S CAREER AS A HARIDAS
On hearing that my father was a Haridas, some people might without further thought
underestimate our merit by comparing us with other Haridases. It is, therefore, necessary to
describe my father's professional merit as a Haridas. He was in British service several years ago,
but being disgusted with dependence he adopted the profession of performing kirtan as suited to
spiritual as well as temporal welfare. All will be compelled to admit after inquiry that my father was
quite free from the blemishes which are so conspicuous in other Haridases, and in consequence of
which their profession has fallen into disrepute. My father never went to anybody's house to express
a desire that his katha should be heard and he looked upon another man's wife as his own mother.
As other Haridase lack these two virtues, they have fallen in the estimation of the public.+++(4)+++ They
preach to the people that it is a sin to go a-begging from door to door, but they themselves go from
place to place and from door to door, entreating the people. " Sir, I am a Haridas from such and
such a place ; please hear my katha." Thus these Haridases sell the name of God. In their kathas
they preach that it is sinful to look at another woman, but they themselves lead astray hundreds of
women into the path of immorality by deceiving people under the garb of religion.+++(5)+++ Great God ! May
these men be consigned to hell. My object in alluding to this matter is to show that as my father was
free from these vices, he was worthy of being loved by the people. Moreover, wherever he
performed a kirtan, he captivatad the minds of the people by his excellent and fascinating discourse,
while we, two brothers amused the illiterate portion of the audience by means of our musical skill.
Consequently, our kathas became acceptable to the people and used to draw large audiences.

Though our father did not go to anybody's house, those who appreciated him used to come to our
house and invite him. We too adopted an attitude of unconcern like our father. Observing our
attitude of indifference, even our friends and relatives haled us and used to remark that we could
show such indifference only during the lifetime of our father, but that after his death we might be
reduced to a state of extreme distress. They made these remarks because we had learnt no
profession whereby to earn our living, and consequently in their opinion we could have, on the death
of our father, no other alternative than to go begging from door to door. What then would become of
our independence and unconcern ? But thinking that they talked in this thoughtless manner
because they could not discern how noble and generous our minds were, we paid no heed to them.+++(4)+++
Let that be.

### EFFORTS FOR TRAINING IN ART OF FIGHTING
As from the above, our intelligent readers would easily be able to form an idea of our
profession, we revert to the main topic without further dilating upon it. Although in our childhood we
were devotedly attached to the pursuit above referred to, it was quite impossible for us, because of
our tender age, to obtain the necessary appliances, and consequently we had at that time only the
improvement of our physique within our power. Accordingly we set about it with vigour. We also
endeavoured to collect men, but being young we could not exercise any influence upon others. With
advancing years our minds also began to expand in regard to this matter. We at first thought that it
was necessary for us to acquire proficiency in the art of war, and we therefore, made efforts in that
direction. But the subjects of the British Government being disarmed, we could not learn the
profession of arms. Subsequently, with a view to see if we could have an opportunity of learning that
art in a Native State, we sent a letter to BAPU SAHEB KURUNDWADKAR couched in very
respectful terms.

We did not retain a copy of the letter, but the substance of it was as follows:—

#### LETTER TO CHIEF OF KURUNDWAD
"To  
Shrimant Rajeshri Bapu Saheb Kurundwadkar.

My object in writing this letter is as follows :—
God has not concentrated all things in one place ; they are scattered over different
places. Those who are endowed with riches do not entertain lofty ideas like myself, but bring
their families into disgrace by disreputable habits, while poor men like me are animated by a
desire for commendable achievements involving expense. From this, it appears that
Brahmadeo is not inclined to concentrate all things in all places. " Desires take birth in the
minds of the poor and die." Such being our case, we venture to trouble you a little. As in our
former existence, now also we have a great predilection for the art of war, but various reasons
render it difficult for us to acquire it in this place. You are our easteman, blessed with riches,
and have in your service some veteran warriors. We shall, therefore, feel very grateful to you
if you kindly arrange for our board for a year or six months at least and afford us facility for
acquiring the said art. God has given us the necessary means of subsistence, but we have
addressed this request to you simply because of our aforesaid predilection, and we hope that
it has not been made in vain."

This was the substance of our letter, but the brief reply we received was :—
" No such arrangements can be made here at present."

This reply enabled me to form an estimate of the man. What a disparity, I said, between his
valiant, warlike and generous ancestors and their imbecile progeny, who by their actions have
tarnished the reputation of their ancestry !+++(4)+++ Their ancestors sacrificed themselves on the battlefield in
the service of their masters, while of these three brothers, one wastes his time in flying pigeons,
another in associating with low characters and in smearing his body with the red earth of a
gymnasium, and the third in composing aryas. Any discerning person can gain an insight into their
ways of life. How can these men know my worth ? They would have given us support, had we been
either pigeon-flyers, gymnasts or composers of aryas.+++(4)+++ Let this pass. Some days after we had been
disappointed in this manner, my brother, Balkrishna alias Bapurao, went from Poona to Kolhapur.
With the express purpose of paying a visit to Sayajirao (sic) of Kolhapur. As he was not there my
brother walked to the fort at Panhala and paid him a visit there. He first presented a cocoanut to him
with great respect and then said : " (Your ancestors and) you have been our patrons from ancient
times. We Brahmins have always served your throne. I, therefore, pray that you will be generously
pleased to enlist us in a cavalry regiment." When my brother made this verbal petition, one of his
relatives, by name Kagalkar, was also present there. Both of them surveyed my brother closely and
remarked that he was short of stature and wanting in girth and that they did not employ Poona
Brahmins. As soon as these precious words fell from their lips, (my brother) formed an estimate of
their Kshatriya origin.+++(5)+++ Without saying anything further he returned to Poona.
### LESSONS AT DHAR
Some days after this we accompanied our father to the Native State of Dhar without any
particular object. There we stayed for about two months and associated ourselves with a Maratha
boy. In order to practise shooting, we
used to steal away with his fowling-piece, at midday, to the bank of a tank. The Maratha boy used to
shoot birds and water-fowls, but we instead of shooting any inoffensive animals, used to put up the
leaves of a bunyan tree to serve as marks to fire at. At Dhar, we learnt how to load a gun and how
to make bullets, small shot, etc. We saw various plaaes in the company of our father with immense
benefit to ourselves. In every place we tried to obtain information relating to our favourite pursuit.
### PRACTICE IN ENDURING HARDSHIPS
As we had undertaken to perpetrate most terrible deeds, we thought it desirable to inure
ourselves to heat, cold and rain, and therefore, finding that we had favourable opportunities in the
course of our travels to acquire the power of endurance we began to undergo privations. Whenever
our father undertook a journey, he used to hire a bullock-cart for that purpose. But we, with a view to
acquire a habit of walking, did not sit in it on such occasions, but used to walk 24 miles at a stretch
without minding heat and rain. We used to lie on ghongris though we had mattresses to sleep on.
Though we had plenty of food, we used to live on dal and churmure. Our parents used to get angry
with us, but they did not know our ulterior design. We had chosen Poona as our resting place after a
journey of about six months or a year performed in the above manner, and there we generally used
to rest for four months. It was on our return to Poona that we found time to ponder calmly over the
object in view. We resolved to undertake any hazardous enterprise for the sake of our religion, but
to refrain from such deeds as were not conformable to it. Whenever we thought of exerting
ourselves in furthering our favourite object, the fear of our parents would stand in our way. On such
occrsions we used to feel that we should also, like some boys who foresake their parents and
betake themselves to the stage, throw off dependence and pursue the object in view. But when in
this mood we considered the matter from a religious point of view, our conscience would not permit
us to follow such a course. Consequently we abandoned that design and resolved that come what
might, we would do what we could without foresaking our parents.
### DESIRE TO PROCURE ARMS
First of all, a desire to procure arms engrossed our minds. We knew that it was idle to realise
that desire in British territory. Consequently, when we accompanied our father in his travels through
the Nizam's territory, we made inquiries (concerning arms) in that State. But want of money came in
our way there. Then after deliberation we came to the conclusion that it was not culpable to steal
anything required for a religious purpose and thus prepared ourselves to do that. In a place called
Bid we first bought a sword-stick for five rupees. We made up that amount partly by the sale-
proceeds of our books and partly by the money we already possessed. Later on we stole a five-
chambered revolver from the same shop. This was our first move in the direction of stealing arms.
Subsequently, wherever we happened to travel we procured in any way we could whatever arms we
came across. I cannot now enter into any details about this matter. We however, began to procure
arms in this manner.
### THEN TO COLLECT MEN
Then the thought occurred to us that we should now collect men. With this object in view we
won over our friends who were our equals in age by discoursing with them on religious topics. But
after the lapse of a few days we found that they could be of no use to us, because we needed such
men as would carry out our orders, while the friends whom we had
969gathered together did not seem inclined to do this. Taking us to be illiterate, they used to make an
ostentatious display of their learning in our presence. Moreover they did not seem to have that pure
devotion to religion which we had. Consequently we broke off: our connection with them. Then on
reflecting as to who would obey us, we came to the conclusion that obedience could be expected
from children alone, whose minds being tender could be moulded in any way, we chose. Having
come to this conclusion, we went wherever school-boys played at cricket and began by our
exhortations to create in their minds a dislike for cricket and a taste for native games. We, could
secure only eight boys at the outset and with them we went up the hillock situated below Parvati.
We first told them to play badabadi and after two or three days we brought two or three slings and
began to teach them how to throw stones. On these occasions many other boys used to come up
there. As we gave them the same advice, the number of boys began to increase until it reached
150. So many boys did not assemble every day. They used to assemble at their convenience.
### RULES FOR THE TRAINEES
We afterwards framed (the following) rules for the club :—(1) Every boy shall implicitly obey
both of us. (2) Those desirous of joining the club shall pay to the head of the institution the sum of
one anna and a half for sling (3) While practising with the sling, the slingers should stand at a
distance of at least ten cubits from other persons, as, otherwise, the sling, while being whirled, might
strike against the face of any of the by-standers. An out-of-the-way place was reserved for novices
joining (the club). They were required to practise stone-throwing by standing there (to avoid)
members of the club themselves being struck by the stones which in the case of novices are not
well directed. With a view to prevent men or animals being struck by the stones, the slingers were
required to see that none of them were near before beginning practice. There should be no quarrels.
These were the rules. We divided sling-practice under three heads :—(1) Slinging along the ground
; (2) Slinging horizontally ; (3) Slinging skyward. The lad who knew fairly these three modes and
who could fire double as well as small shot was looked upon by us as tolerably proficient and we
took note of him.
### ORGANISATION OF THE CLUB
When we had about 25 to 30 of these fairly proficient lads, we organised the club on a new
basis as follows :—Having divided the members of the club into two companies, I, myself became
the captain of one, and my brother that of the other. To each of these companies was given a red
ochre-coloured flag, which was its chief ensign. It was also provided with a red flag. Each company
had also its medical officer, who wore round his neck a haversack which contained the following
medicines and instruments useful for the treatment of wounds :—(A piece of) coal, pankanis,
bamboo-powder, a knife, a pair of scissors, pincers for extracting thorns, marking-nuts, needles, etc.
Having organised these companies, every Saturday and Sunday we repaired to our rendezvous
situated at a considerable distance beyond the Parvati (Hill). After going there, one (company)
planted its flag on (the top of) a hill and held the place, while the other company did the same at the
foot of the hill. When everything was ready, the operations commenced at a given signal. Then we
two brothers showed by manoeuvring (our respective companies) how an attack was to be delivered
and how it was to be repulsed. The moment any one was struck by a stone, the red flag was shown
at the sight of which the slinging was to cease. After attending to the (wounded) man, the operations
again commenced. Many of the lads were struck by stones on these occasions, but none of them
wavered. These operations continued (for some
970time). For some days after this, my brother's company used to proceed to Chatursingi for practice,
while mine continued to be drilled near Parvati. After eight or fifteen days we used to have a (sham)
fight between them. The only object in view in doing so was to inspire our companies with courage.
After every (sham) fight we used to distribute amongst them parched gram, rice and such other
cheap eatables as we could, with our (limited) means, purchase. We did this to attach them to
ourselves. When about two or three months had passed in this manner, we thought that it was
desirable to have a tutelary deity for our club, as, otherwise, our proceedings would be devoid of
interest. We, therefore, selected a convenient place near the Parvati (Hill), and having with much toil
removed the luxurious growth of prickly pear at that place, prepared an extensive ground. This is
situated on an eminence at the foot of Parvati. A canal passes through the lower portion of this
ground, and here a spot beneath a nim tree was fixed upon by us for our idol.
### OUR CHOICE OF THE DEITY
We then selected the powerful Maruti as our tutelary deity, as we thought that there was none
like him among all the gods. How to procure his image was the next thought that engaged our
attention. Meanwhile, while asleep one day, I saw in a dream the image of Bajarang Balbhima,
which spoke to me as follows :— "I am lying in the very place where you are preparing the ground.
Search for me, I am willing to come." I awoke after this dream and spoke of it to my brother, when I
learnt that he too had a similar dream. We, however, had no faith in the dream, as we could not
believe that our religious merit was so high. But we gave ar account of it to our club. The ground
was thereupon dug at that place to a great depth, and the image was discovered. At this time we
two brothers being at a considerable distance from that spot, they came and informed me of the
discovery of (the image of ) Maruti. With extreme delight we saw that image, which was about a
span and a half high The thick coating of red-lead on it dropped away and disclosed the image
clearly to our view. It had the Dronagiri mountain in one hand and a gada in the other, while
Jambumali was lying prostrate beneath its feet—a spectacle which pleased us most. We took the
image home and made arrangements to consecrate it with the due ceremony. Before finding this
image, we had besmeared a piece of stone with red-lead and all the members of the club used to
worship it with great devotion. When, however, they saw this image, they became very impatient to
have it consecrated. But as an interval of fifteen days had to elapse before the auspicious day, we
worshipped the image at our own house for the time being. Desiring that no day should pass without
the performance of arti before that image, we composed a song for the occasion in a melodious
metre. The song is given below. We named the image Gophnya Maruti.
### SONG IN PRAISE OF GOPHNYA MARUTI
(In the same tune as the song in praise of Bhuvanasunder.)
By waving lights before the lotus-like feet of Maruti, let us cross the ocean of this world in
ease-Dhrupada. The moment he was born, he sprang forward to seize the sun, supposing it to be a
fruit. He set up a whoop of exultation, and the sound thereof having filled the earth went up to
heaven. 'All the humbled gods being startled at the sight of thy short stature, glorify thee ; the
monkeys were greatly delighted (at thy advent). Who can rival one who worships Hanuman? Neither
sin, nor distress, nor anxiety will be with him, (and) none will be able to overcome him. He crossed
the waters of the ocean and reached the shore. He inspired Sita, the spouse of Rama with courage.
The hearts of monkeys were much gladdened. He appeared
971(to Chapekar) in a dream, and having asked (him) to make a search for himself, declared that his
own image was at his disposal. Damodar, Hari's son, says that the Gophnya Maruti has been won
over to his side. Therefore, have you come near Parvati and have become our helper, and we are
therefore overjoyed.
### DAY FIXED FOR INSTALLATION
Having composed this song, we asked all tthe members of the club) to learn it by heart, and
commenced to recite it every day before the god Maruti. Meanwhile, the day selected by us for the
consecration of the idol having approached, we issued, two daya previous to it, the following
invitations couched in polite language, to all the members (of the club) :—
" The noon of Saturday, the 2nd day of the dark half Chaitra, having been unanimously
fixed for the consecration of the image of the self-existent Balabhima at the appointed place
at the foot of the Parvati (Hill), it is necessary for you, as members of the club, to be present
on such an auspicious occasion. Should any one bring with him flowers, coconuts, buka, gulal
and other articles of worship, they would be thankfully received. (Signed) Damodar Hari
Chapekar and Balkrishna Hari Chapekar, Managers."
We issued these invitations, but the decrees of fate are inscrutable. Although we felt
indescribable delight at the continued additions to the membership of our club, I had a presentiment
that something was to happen which would mar our joy and we had already a prognostication as to
the quarter from which the trouble was to come. We saw that those sportive doings of ours were
likely to be stopped if any of our members received a serious wound from a stone and, therefore, we
were very careful about the matter. We also feared that if the Police got scent of this matter, they
would throw impediments in our way. To obviate this we arranged that our boys should neither
come out of, nor return to, the city in a large body, but should do so in batches of five. We
accordingly formed such batches. We also made it a rule that the leader of each of these batches
should, while coming (out of the city), place a stone near the street-lamp which stands between the
road passing by the Bhikardas Police Station and the one passing the Chinchechi Talim, and should
remove it while returning to the city. This arrangement was made with a view to have an idea of the
number of the boys that would go there ahead of us. So much for the second of our apprehensions.
Our third fear was that our boys might have a quarrel on the way for which we might have to suffar.
For, this pursuit has this peculiar characteristic that it makes its votaries inconsiderate ; it impels
men to make an immediate use of their powers. Our inclinations are moulded by the nature of the
occupations we follow. Accordingly, as exercises with the stick, the sword, and also slinging and
wrestling tend to instil a spirit of rivalry into the minds of men, the members of our club began to
quarrel on the way and complaints about the matter reached my ears.
### INCIDENT WITH A MISSIONARY
It happened one day that while our men had assembled at the foot of the Parvati before our
arrival there, they saw a native missionary accompanied by a friend passing by. One of them had a
double-barrelled gun in his hand. Taking the men to be pervert, our boys began to jeer at him. But
they, through fright, took no notice of the jeers and went their way. When we two brothers came
there afterwards we were informed of the incident, when we censured the boys for what they had
done and advised them not to embroil themselves with any one without any reason. After giving this
972advice we started to return to the city in batches as usual. We both of us, accompanied by two or
four boys used to start after all had left. While we were on our way back into the city as usual, we
saw coming from the opposite direction along the bank of the Parvati tank, the two men who had
been jeered at by our boys. On catching sight of them, our companions showed us by signs that
these were the same men. They loo recognised our companions, and with a view to pick a quarrel
with us, seeing that our number was small at the time, demanded of us why we were abusing them.
Thereupon, although the* fault lay primarily with our boys, we took their side thinking that they had
been (sufficiently) censured in secret and that it would be undignified on our part to remain aloof at
this time, though our party was in the wrong. We, therefore, addressed the (two) men as follows: —"
Sir, (sic) go your way quietly. How could we be abusing you now, when we were not speaking about
you at all ? An altercation then took place between us, but it would be out of place to describe it
here. In the end, they challenged us to dare to go to the hill the next day if we were true Brahmins.
We retorted that we were always in the habit of going there, but if they were genuine perverts, they
should dare to go there the next day. Such were the hot words exchanged between us. The next
was a Sunday. Having assembled all the members (of the club) at 2 p.m., we exhorted them not to
flinch, as that was but an ordinary occasion on which their progress in the art which they had been
learning was to be put to the test. After this exhortation, I explained what toctics were to be adopted.
Four boys of insinuating and polite address were stationed at the principal post in the vicinity of the
Maruti, with instructions to resort to conciliation alone and to send the men away. The rest of the
boys were kept concealed in hollows and depressions of the ground, with orders not to make use of
their slings as far as posible. At the most they were to throw stones with their hands, but they were
not to show their slings. We took this precaution because we did not wish to make it known that we
were practised slingers. Having issued detailed instructions as to which batch was first to attack our
opponents if they voluntarily showed an inclination to fight, and as to the order and manner in which
the other batches were to follow in the onset if the first batch was repulsed, we both of us, dressed
like gentlemen, seated ourselves at some distance at a place from which we could clearly see all
the operations. Our object in so doing was to intervene in the fight, posing as gentlemen,
immediately after (our opponents) had received a thrashing, and to put stop to the quarrel by
exhortations to both the parties. For, as we had to pass many days in that place, it was not desirable
in our interests that any serious mishap should occur to our opponents. It was for this end in view
that we resorted to this mild course of action. Having made the above preparations we waited (for
our opponents). They, however, did not turn up even until nightfall. At last, the three boys whom we
had posted on the road as scouts came in and informed us that those men, who had four
Mussalmans with them had been frightened away at the sight of our position. Hearing this, we
returned to our respective homes. Then in order to avoid a repetition of such troubles, we strictly
forbade our boys from needlessly interfering with other people.
### THE EUROPEANS SCARED AWAY
After this, two Europeans came for a stroll along the canal, when even we ourselves lost our
self-control on seeing them, and urged our men to attack them. But as they were at a considerable
distance from us none of our stones struck them, but as the stones fell near them, they took fright
and ran away. We heard afterwards that a short time after this an English
973newspaper, called the Deccan Herald, published a complaint against our club. Some reformers (too)
used to come for exercise in the open air to that part of the town. We had taken care to know all
about the reformers as we looked upon them as our implacable enemies. We know the names of all
of them, but I need not pollute this memoir by mentioning them in this place. We used to come
across these irreligious reformers during our strolls in the city, and the members (of the club) were
fully at liberty to jeer pt them. After this state of things had continued for some time, the reformers
got vexed and suggested to the Police, through the medium of the Dnyan Prakash, to put a stop to
the doings of the urchins. When this complaint appeared in that newspaper, we had an
apprehension that our satisfaction might perhaps receive a check from that quarter.
### A STRANGER WAS STRUCK
While such anxious thoughts were engaging our minds, the abovementioned auspicious day
for the consecration of the Maruti arrived. On the preceding day all the members (of the club) were
in high spirits. The work of building a shrine was in progress by using the water of the canal just
below, and a pole having been fastened to the nim tree beneath which the shrine of Maruti was
built, it was surmounted by a big banner of red-ochre colour. On that banner were written the
following words :—"Better to stick to our own religion until the end ; the religion of others is full of
peril. May Gophnys Maruti triumph." Many of the boys were practising sling exercise, and everybody
was in a joyful mood, when, as God would have it, I was informed all of a sudden that one of the
passers-by had been hit by a stone. Thereupon we both of us went to the place and found that he
was, in his exasperation, pouring forth a torrent of abuse. We went up to him and tried to pacify him.
We also promptly treated (his wound) with the drugs in our possession. But the man was inexorable,
and left us with a threat to report the matter to the Police. Having guessed that the man would have
to go into the city before he could give information to the Police, we determined to leave the place
within that interval.
### CAUGHT BY THE POLICE AND LET OFF
So we sent away the boys by different routes as usual. First of all we sent away all the slings
with a boy. We left last of all with some boys, but were soon arrested by the Police. I said to the
Police sepoy, " We did not strike him with the stone. If the fact that I treated his wound constitutes
any offence on my part, then there is no help in the matter. I had gone there to take a stroll with no
particular object in view, when, having, heard some noise, I went to see what the matter was, and
finding this man wounded I benevolently treated his wound in the manner I knew, and that has
landed me in this trouble." The sepoy then asked me to point out the boy who had hurled the stone,
so that he may arrest him. But as I did not like to see a boy of tender age given in charge of the
Police, I offered to go with the sepoy to the Faraskhana. While on our way, I flattered the sepoy in
various ways, when he remarked that as a complaint had been lodged, he was helpless in the
matter and was bound to take me (to the Faraskhana). I then turned to the boy (who had lodged the
complaint), and reminding him of the fact that he was a Brahmin by caste, pointed out that the
wound which he had received not being of a serious nature could be healed in a day or two. It was
in consequence of the use of the three expedients, namely, conciliation bribery and discord, that the
boy (relented and) told the sepoy to let us go, as he wished to withdraw his complaint. The sepoy,
however, now assumed
974an air of self-importance and declared that it was not in his power to let go a culprit whom he had
once arrested. I thereupon eulogised him again, when he said that he would ask the complainant's
father whether he would like to have the complaint withdrawn. I felt much relieved at these words of
his, because Brahmins being always very considerate, (I was hopeful that) he (complainant's father)
would pay some attention to what I intended to say. I, therefore, went to his house. The surname of
this man is Sathe, and he resides in the Jogeshwari's Bol. On going to his house I told him that I did
not know who had thrown the stone (at his son) and that I had merely treated the wound. Hearing
this, that amiable gentleman at once told the sepoy that he had no complaint to make against me.
The sepoy, therefore, could not do anything more and so he went away. I was overjoyed to see that
we had got out of the clutches of the Police in a very ingenious manner. For we had made it a point
of honour not to get into their clutches. It was our fixed resolve not to have our names in their books.
After this, we gratefully praised Gophnya Maruti for rescuing us from the above-mentioned danger.
We, however, postponed the consecration ceremony which was to take place the next day. Having
determined not to use again a locality which had been polluted by the Police, we informed ell the
members (of our club) that we had given up the place. When all of them came to know of this Police
affair, many of them became frightened and severed their connection with our club.
### WE SHIFTED TO OTHER PLACES
We then began to consider how to act next. Having thought over the matter, we made up our
mind to select an open space within the city and to train our boys there. We, therefore, hired the
open piece' of ground belonging to Londhe for Rs. 2 per month, and having placed the image of
Maruti therein prepared a wrestling ground in front of the image. Here we used to teach the
following exercises : Wrestling, dandpatta, kathi, lance exercise, high and wide jumping and boxing.
4 to 6 in the evening was the appointed time. We also used to teach drill. This went on for nearly a
month and a half, but differences having afterwards arisen between the owner of the ground and
ourselves, we were obliged to leave it. We then began to search for some other place, when we
came to know that there was a (suitable) place in the wada of Khasgiwale who lives in the
Jogeshwari's Bol and that he was willing to give it to us. On receiving this information we made
inquiries about the ground, and found that it was extensive and secluded as we desired. The most
convenient thing about this ground was that no rent was to be charged for it.
### WHAT WE TAUGHT
The place being out of repairs, we took much pains to put it in order. We whitewashed it and
having placed (an image of) Maruti in a niche in the middle, hung portraits of warriors on all sides.
We had made it a rule to hang (in our gymnasium) the portraits of warriors alone, portraits of women
being prohibited. We (also) collected historical works containing accounts of warriors and
established a library at the place, and it was by putting forward the name of this institution that we
became known there. Here we admitted only such boys as were considered by us to be of
undoubted rectitude. About fifteen boys joined (this institution). They were asked to attend in the
morning for exercise, while we used to teach dandpatta, kathi, etc., during noon. In the evening at 5
o'clock, one of us
975two brothers used to give historical readings. Selecting some episode in ancient history, we used to
dilate upon it in a way suited to impress upon the minds of the boys a sense of self-respect and love
for one's religion, and to show how easy a matter it was to lay down one's life for these. Whenever,
in the course of these readings, we came across descriptions of battles containing such terms and
expressions as Morchebandi, khandak, ganimi-kava, and chhapa, as well as the names of arms, we
explained them with sufficient clearness to make them understood. We also used to enter on
religious disquisitions at intervals, in order to prevent the social views of the boys from undergoing
any deviation from the precepts of the Shastras as well as from the prevalent custom. With a view to
confirm the boys in their hostility towards the reformers, we used to comment severely upon the
latter in the course of these disquisitions. At the conclusion of these readings arti was performed
before the Maruti and all of us closed our eyes and concentrated our minds on the valour-inspiring
image of Hanuman. Such was our programme until sunset. At night we two brothers disguised
ourselves and went round the different streets to suit our actions to our disguise. At the conclusion
of our gymnastic exercises, we used to give to our boys moistened grampulse with pieces of dried
coconut-kernel to eat. All the boys had instructions to bring in pulse, pieces of dried cocoanut-
kernel, historical books, old weapons, old manuscripts, old or new clothes, (in short) everything that
they could find and that could be of use to the club. Whether good or bad, this course was adopted
by us and enforced as a rule in order to make a collection of good and useful articles. This enabled
us to stock our library with many such things. Then, in order to keep all those things in good order,
we (gave them in charge of some boys) assigned to each of them his duty and made him
responsible for his work. The place had a large gate, but we kept it closed and used the dindi alone
for our purpose. A bell was hung inside and its string was left hanging outside. Each of the boys had
been given a number. Whenever a boy came to the gate, he rang the bell by pulling the string ; then
those inside asked him his number, and if satisfied (of his identity) they opened the gate. We named
this club " Rashtra Hitechhu Mandali." We had a loathing for the game of cricket. We intensely hated
the boys who, laying aside our one thousand games, had shown a predilection for that game, as
well as those teachers who had encouraged them to do so. With a view to accustom our boys to
fighting without needlessly troubling any one, we used to send a batch of five or six of our boys to
the place where cricket was being played. These boys were to make away with the cricket things of
the players in a skilful manner. Sometimes the boys had to fight for the kit, and sometimes they
made away with it without having to fight.
### TIRADE AGAINST REFORMIST MARRIAGE
It then began to be talked abroad that one Chapekar was the cause of all these troubles. I,
therefore, began to call myself Ramchandra Hari Marathe and told (the boys) to address me by that
name. About this time an England-returned reformer by name Kashinathpant Gadgil who had
contrary to the (Hindu) religion, allowed his daughter to remain unmarried till she reached the age of
sixteen years, gave her in marriage to the son of another reformer named Chintaman Narayan Bhat
and the marriage was celebrated with great pomp. We did not at all approve of this match. Both
Bhat and Gadgil are related to us, but as they are reformers and as they contravene the precepts of
the Dharma Sastras, they have incurred our bitter hostility. We had taken a vow to treat even our
father as our enemy if he infringed the Shastras. We were invited to dine and to a pan-supari (on the
occasion) by both the above persons, but I alone out of the
976male members of our family attended the pan-supari. I did so, thinking that if I went there I would
have an opportunity of personally witnessing their irreligious conduct and thus of satisfying myself
about the matter. I did not attend their dinner party, as I looked down upon them as Dheds. The day
of the varat procession at last arrived, when, thinking that it would be a disgrace if that procession
connected . with an irreligious marriage paraded through the city with eclat and without any hitch, in
the face of religious enthusiasts (like ourselves) we determined to obstruct it anyhow and sent word
round to all our companions that it was to be attacked that night. We conjectured that the procession
being a large one would pass through the main street, and therefore we inspected the road passing
by the market, and having stationed boys in the cross lanes supplied them with stones, with
instructions to fiercely attack the procession the moment it came within their respective bounds.
Having made these preparations we waited (for the procession), but were informed that instead of
passing the high road with great pomp it had taken a by-way. Thus our plan proved futile. Still, we
hastened to attack the procession, but the onset did not prove as effective as we had wished. We
desired to see at least one of the newly married couple (wounded and) taken to the hospital. On
learning this, many will be struck with our hard-heartedness, but after a little consideration all
sensible persons will be obliged to admit that what we did was right. It is a rule laid down by the
Shastras that the following are the four methods of overcoming any person :—Conciliation,
presents, fomenting dissensions, and punishment.. It is in accordance with that rule that my other
castmen have been fighting the reformers. The antagonistic parties are known as the Krishna and
the Shukla parties. As, however, the Shukla party, being powerless to punish their opponents, is
defied by them, we thought over the matter, and with a desire to take the power of chastisement into
our own hands, made this initial effort (in that direction). But this our first experiment did not prove
as successful as we had wished. Only a few ladies were hit. I, however, record that incident here,
because these ladies must have a recollection of it. After this, we went to Bombay for Chaturmas.
When leaving for that place, we appointed one (of us) to be the chief of our club, and having
arranged that the members of the club should act under his lead and that he should treat them in
accordance with the rules laid down by us, we departed.
### WE SEVERED CONNECTION WITH THE CLUB
While we were away they collected several arms, viz., three old muskets, six swords and
some sword-sticks, and showed them to us when we visited Poona for the Ganpati (festival). On
inquiry we came to know that these arms had been stolen by a boy named Ranade from his own
house and that Bhide had aided him in doing so. We commended him for this. Then we heard what
each member (of the club) had to say individually, and thus came to know the details of what had
taken place during (the preceding) two months. Many of them told me that Bhide was in the habit of
speaking ill of me behind my back in their presence. This thought then came into my mind : " If one
acts in opposition to us even at this stage, there is no knowing what he might do when the club
becomes invested with special importance. It will not therefore be advantageous to continue further
such a culb as this. What shall we do next ? " We then called a meeting of the members of the club
and addressed them as follows:— "All of you are aware that this man, Bhide, had maliciously
spoken ill of us in your presence for no fault of ours. We have, however, come to this conclusion
from this occurrence, that we are not fitted to do any good to our country and have, therefore given
up everything from to-day. Any other person who may "desire to take up this business is welcome to
do so. We do not wish to have any of these things,
977So saying we severed our connection with the club. After this, many of the boys came to my house
and implored me with tears in their eyes not to break up the club. Bhide wept most of all. That
deceitful individual shed a profusion of tears, and having protested that he had not spoken, (ill of
me) implored me not to dissolve our club. We, however, refused to listen to him and left for Bombay.
After some days I learnt that most of the things (belonging to the club) were taken away by a boy
named Devdhar. He also took away the arms, but when he came to know that the Police having
received information about the matter were about to search his house, he threw them into my house
which he knew was close by, through a latticed opening, keeping with himself only a dagger and
some spears. In the meantime, the Police came to search his house. He was arrested and
prosecuted. This news was immediately conveyed to us by our friend, Dattatraya Bhuskute, in a
letter. I accordingly at once came to Poona by the night mail (train), and having disposed of the
arms with the help of Bhuskute immediately returned to Bombay. Devdhar did not mention the name
of any member of the club. He was asked by many wiseacres to mention the name of Chapekar, but
he did not pay any heed to their advice. He was afterwards discharged by the Court because of his
tender age. So ended our club. We at first felt very sorry that it had come to an end but after
consideration we came to the conclusion that Gosavya Maruti had done all this for our good. For
had the club continued to exist, it would certainly have been difficult to ensure the secrecy of our
doings. Afterwards, we two brothers came to Poona with our father, and having thought over the
matter, made up our minds not to have any club, but to enlist the co-operation of Bhuskute alone in
what we wished to do, so that there may be no risk of the ma f ter being divulged. Having come to
this conclusion, we took action accordingly. All the boys, with the exception of Bhuskute, we
stopped from visiting our house, and he too as a rule came at night.
### CONGRESS AND SOCIAL REFORM CONTROVERSY
Meanwhile (the time for holding)' the National Congress arrived. As it was to be held at Poona
that year, we were desirous of seeing personally what sort of a revolutionary movement it was.
Before this, a fierce dispute was going on in the city between the orthodox and the reform parties
with regard to the Social Conference. We do not approve of the National Congress, much less of the
Social Conference. But though there is no possibility of any good resulting from the National
Congress, it does not entail any loss either, except in so far as the expenditure of money is
concerned. The lakhs of rupees that are spent upon it are lost (to the country), but it has this
redeeming feature that it has nothing to do with religious matters. We, therefore, do not care if the
Congress were held even twenty-five times a year. But we cannot view with patience the chandalin
(i.e., Social Conference) that has been thrust into its bosom by these reformers. This is the principal
reason why we look upon them as our inveterate enemies. We are aware that as we are not
independent, now, everybody adopts whatever course he likes. We must, however, conduct
ourselves as directed in the Shastras. But as the reformers are endeavouring to circumscribe our
freedom of action by laws, why should we not 'avenge ourselves upon them ? There is no reason
why we should not. At this time a violent discussion was going on between the two parties. Bal
Gangadhar Tilak took up the leadership of one party and Mahadev Govind Ranade that of the other,
and a war of words commenced. At this time Shridhar Vithal Date sided with the orthodox party.
This man is an enthusiastic admirer of (the Hindu) religion. He is possessed of more self-respect
than others and is therefore ever willing to undergo any expense in order to prove the correctness of
his own opinions. The co-operation of a man of such determination resulted
978in a great accession of strength to the orthodox party. But such strength is of no avail because
efforts not backed by physical force are doomed to failure. The demands of the National Congress
have proved futile for this reason. Englishmen know that the National Congress means eating,
drinking, recreation and a profusion of tall talk and nothing more. Had our people been as spirited as
the Americans, they (i.e., Englishmen) would have been compelled to take our demands into
consideration. The Americans having profited by their National Congress we followed their example,
but no one gives thought to what those spirited people did when their demands were refused. To
make every meeting of the Congress more imposing than the previous one, is the (sole) object
these blockheads have in view. From their point of view, the greater the expenditure on pleasure, on
eating and drinking, on illuminations, on talking and writing, the more is the good of the country
secured. Let that, however, pass. As I will have to touch upon this topic later on, I shall not dwell
upon it further in this place. In short, we did not at all like the wordy warfare that went on between
the two parties.
### WE STRUCK TWO REFORMERS
We two brothers, therefore, thought that the chastisement of fome prominent individual from
amongst the reformers would be conducive to the furtherance (of the cause of the orthodox party).
From the very first, we entertained a violent grudge against the Sudharak newspaper, but as we
were not able to put our thoughts into execution while Agarkar edited that paper, that sinner
escaped (chastisement) at our hands. Being, however, inspired with a strong desire to do something
on this occasion, we determined to pounce upon either of the two editors of that paper whom we
might be able to catch, and with that object in view we watched for an ipportunity. This newspaper
always speaks ill of the orthodox party and their way. Its articles have a tendency to produce
misapprehension in the minds of the people respecting the Dharma Shastras by placing different
interpretations on the precepts contained in them. Being backed by Englishmen, it makes use of
such violent language as would wound the feelings of all true lovers of religion. It is impossible for
me to describe the state of our minds when we read this paper. On some occasions our wrath was
so uncontrollable that we burnt the issues of that paper. But as that mode of punishment was. not
calculated to pacify our feelings, we began to think of inflicting corporal chastisement. As the
reflection that the editors were our castemen used to generate compassion in our minds, we
resolved that instead of capital punishment they should receive some ordinary chastisement. Then a
letter of warning was to be sent to them. If they took that warning, well and good. If not, no pity was
to be shown to them. We, accordingly, marked their houses and watched (their movement). One
day we were informed that there was to be a Sanskrit performance at the Anandobhava Theatre,
and we thought that both the editors would be present there on the occasion. But that day things did
not take the turn we wished. We next learnt that the students of the Bhave School were to give a
performance of " Hamlet " at the Aryabhushana Theatre and we concluded that as that institution
was not acceptable to the said editors, they would be present at the performance through feelings of
jealously. We, therefore, waited outside that theatre, but were unable to ascertain from there as to
who were inside. I, therefore, somehow procured four annas (to purchase a ticket with) and went
inside the theatre. There I saw two persons whom I identified, one of them being Patwardhan, the
editor of Sudharak, and the other Kulkarni, a teacher in the New Marathi School. I then came out
and informed my brother of this, when
979he went in and saw them. We then waited for the termination of the performance. It soon came to an
end. Kulkarni was the first to leave the theatre, and I dealt him a blow, which was not heavy, near
the entrance to the lane opposit Hamjekjan's gymnasium. It must have struck him lightly on the back
and part of the head. Two or three persons were walking with him at the time. Having dealt the blow
I hurried away. Patwardhan, who left (the theatre) after (Kulkarni), was closely followed by my
brother, whom 1 joined in the Budhwar (Peth). While we were thus following him, we reached a
place just below, the dilapidated tower in the Shalukar lane, when my brother, stepping forward,
gave a blow to Patwardhan with a piece of iron piping. That blow must have struck him on the head
near the ear. About three or four persons must have been walking with him at this time. After
execution of this deed, we returned home and heartily thanked God. On the next day we waited to
hear what, the people would say about the matter. It appeared that all orthodox people were much
gratified. We were delighted to know this, and believed that we had done a great service to our
religion. We then thought that after what had happened there was no objection to send them a letter
of warning. Although we two alone (had punished them) it was necessary to make them understand
that we had a following, so that they might be overawed and thus prevented from traducing (the
orthodox) faith. With this object in view we penned a letter. We did not keep a copy of it, but in
substance it was as follows.
" A WARNING TO THE REFORMERS "
" Like your association for removing the obstacles in the way of widow-remarriage (we
also) have formed a society for removing the obstacles in the way of the Aryan! religion, that
is to say, a league, prepared to lay down their lives as well as to take the lives of others for
the sake of that religion. This society does not want the beggarly Congress, much less the
Social Conference. We like all the Hindu customs, whatever they may be including even the
evil practices of the Shimga, which are condemned by the reformers. There is no necessity
for any innovation whatever either in our religious observances or our customs of the present
day. Both the reformers and the non-reformers are, therefore, hereby warned that although
the reformers are forgiven for whatever they have done hitherto, they should conduct
themselves with great caution hearafter, as, otherwise, it would be our sad and painful duty to
put them to the sword. You should, therefore, take note of this warning and conduct yourself
with caution. Remember your forefathers and do not incur the hostility of the whole
community by interference with religion. If you disregard this, Nemesis (will overtake you)."
### OUR COMPOSITION OF POEMS
This letter was sent to the address of Devdhar (one of) the editors of the Sudharak at the New
English School. He gave a substance of it in the issue of the Sudharak dated 25th November 1895.
Afterwards;, a meeting against the Social Conference was held at Thakurdwar in Bombay. On that
occasion, we stepped forward and recited two shloks composed by my brother. We can compose
poetry fairly suited to any occasion, though we are not poets. Being, however, actuated by a desire
to do everything that was necessary for popularizing our favourite subject, and thinking that as
metrical composition commended themselves to the popular taste it
980would be better to lay our views before the public in that form, we studiously devoted ourselves to
the art of versification. I, in particular, had a great predilection for versification and composed many
verses on patriotism. Although my brother had not the same predilection, still he could compose
excellent verses whenever he was in a mood to do so. As the habit of indulging in loquacity in public
meetings did not meet with our approval, my brother composed two shloks with a view to make
known his inmost thoughts to the discerning portion of the public. One of them deals with the Social
Conference and the other is about Daji Abaji Khare, High Court Pleader. It was at that time proved
that this vilest of Brahmins had eaten beef while dining, with Badruddin Tyabji. When we heard of
this we could not restrain our feelings, and having composed" a shlok about him we recited it at the
meeting. I give below the abovementioned two shloks :—
" 1. Listen ! Should the Social Conference be held in the National (Congress) pandal,
the Aryans must certainly withhold their help from that lustreless institution. We shall never
tolerate any revilement of our religion in the (Social) Conference ; we shall first, with a rod in
our hand, strike down the army of reformers.
" 2. That religion-destroyer Khare, having invited Mienchas and others to dine with him,
partook, in defiance of the precepts of his religion, of biscuits, loaves, flesh and spirits in their
company. He should for ever be looked down upon as a Chandal. How is it that the reformers
are not ashamed ! Let us strike him with shoes."
### OUR DESIRE TO BURN THE CONFERENCE PANDAL
As I have already said above that we are not good poets, my readers will kindly overlook the
many blemishes that may be found in the above verses if tested by the rules of prosody and only
appreciate our meaning. These verses were received with cheers by many in the audience. The
reformers, however, appeared to be stung by them, and left the meeting. These people having
received a thrashing at our hands, were well kept in check. Every one of them engaged Purbhayas
for his personal protection and none dared to go out of his house except in carriage They saw from
the signs that a riot would certainly take place if the Social Conference were held in the National
Congress pavilion and so decided to hold its sitting in a different place. The people were much
gratified at this, and we ourselves felt particularly joyful for what we had done. Still we persisted in
our efforts to burn down the Social Conference mandap. Two or three times did we go to the hill
near the Fergusson College at 2 O'clock at night, taking with us materials for setting fire to it, but as
the work of construction was going on day and night to the last moment, our plan proved futile. (Like
the National Congress) the Social Conference too had issued tickets to its delegates. We sought to
gain admittance into that assembly (by that channel). We, therefore, asked some educated youths
to start a reform club to enable us to obtain tickets of admission to the Conference. Being thus
pressed by us, they got up a Young men's Reform Club and applied for tickets of admission to the
Conference in its name. Thereupon Mahadev Govind Ranade asked that the Secretary (of the club)
should be sent to see him with the papers of the club. Our educated friends, however got frightened
at this invitation and none of them would go to him, I, therefore, prepared some bogus papers, and
styling myself the Secretary of the club took them to Mr. Ranade's house at about 8 O'clock in the
evening. This oldest leader of the reformers was sitting in a swinging seat at this time, chatting with
a stranger. I was given a chair near
981them. They continued chatting for a pretty long time, but as the conversation was carried on in a
jargon, half English and half Marathi, I was not able to understand the whole of it. The assault on
Patwardhan was mentioned in the course of their conversation, but they were not aware that the
prime mover in that incident was then sitting by their side. When he finished the conversation Mr.
Ranade turned to me, and having inquired about myself asked a man to examine my papers. He
examined those bogus papers, and enquired of me as to why i had rot brought the originals. I
replied that we never took the original papers outside our club. Thereupon Mr. Ranade said that I
would be provided with tickets if I produced a recommendatory note from some respectable
gentleman. I said in reply, " I am a respectable gentleman myself, and therefore do not stand in
need of any introduction from others. If you believe me, give me the tickets : if not, I do not want
them." I then left the place. Subsequently, a man came from him to pay me a visit, but I refused to
see him. By and by, the day fixed for the Congress approached. The city became thronged with
people arriving from outside. The delight of our educated men knew no bounds. All were in a hurry
and bustle. This put us in mind of the, little girls in our houses. The doings of these self-styled
educated men can only be compared with the play of these girls when they celebrate the marriage
of their dolls, taking much more delight therein then in real marriage ceremonies, while people of
maturer understanding instead of taking any interest in their play, only laugh at their childishness
and fondle and caress them because they are children. These educated classes have got up a toy
regiment as it were, and have become absorbed in witnessing its unarmed drill But as it is
uninteresting to see girls playing with lifeless dolls, so the feeble display of a regiment without the
soul-stirring equipment of arms excites no enthusiasm. Being aware that it was impossible to gauge
the real nature of the Congress without entering (its pavilion), we began to try for a free ticket of
admission. In the meanwhile seeing a Madrasi gentleman taking a stroll on a hill behind the
Fergusson College, we entered into conversation with him, and being convinced that he was a
reformer in his opinions we snatched away his ticket from him and ran away.
### CONGRESS WAS NO USE
With that ticket we gained admission into the pavilion by turns and saw the fun. We came to
know many things on these, occasions. These self-styled educated men find fault with Bajirao the
Second, and accuse him of having lost his kingdom by his habits of luxury and sensuality; but the
conduct of these people is such as will throw his acts into the shade. I ask these wiseacres, who
must have perused their historical books over and over again, if they have any instance in history
wherein empty talk and indulgence in eating and drinking has accomplished the good of one's
country. Has even one of the men famous in history ever tried to unite the world by holding National
Congresses or by delivering speeches ? The answer must be in the negative. It is a matter for deep
regret that our educated men of the present day should not have sense enough to understand that
the good of one's country is accomplished only when crores of meritorious men, reckless of their
lives for the sake of their country, encounter death at the edge of the sword on a battlefield, and by
no other means. Where is the use of simply learning history by rote when at school ? There is
nothing to be gained by learning by-heart the dates of the birth and death of Shivaji. The object of
studying his life is to know what he did in his lifetime : whether he started a National Congress,
collected money from the poor and squandered it on pleasure in the company of false patriots like
982himself gathered together once a year under the pretext of promoting the good of his country ; or
whether he, with a view to the execution of some serious design, suffered privations all his life,
along with his similarly inspired friends, in his attempt to achieve the good of his country. If the
lessons contained (in the lives of such men) are not followed, where is the use of learning history ?
A perusal of the proceedings of the Congress which appeared every year in the newspapers had
convinced me that it was all a sham. It is necessary that I should give here the conclusions at which
I have arrived after a full consideration of the matter.
### HUME AND BRADLAUGH, AGENTS OF THE BRITISH
The first thought struck me was how far the originators of the Congress, viz., Hume,
Bradlaugh and others, being Europeans, could be trusted. It was inexplicable to us how those very
Englishmen who in this country send us to lifelong transportation for the mildest unfavourable
comments (upon the acts of Government) could permit Messrs. Hume, Bradlaugh and others of
their own race to remain alive in England even though they have incited us (to act) in opposition (to
Government). For, the fomentation of dissensions in the country is the last thing that (a nation) can
tolerate. I, therefore, began to consider how, in the face of the above facts, this was possible. And I
came to the conclusion that all this was a sham and nothing more. I was convinced that those
people were acting under the instigation of our wily administrators and had come forward to deceive
the Hindus and to give a harmless turn to their activities with a view never to allow their thoughts to
turn towards deeds of cruelty. Had the case been otherwise, they would long before this have
suffered death at the hands of their countrymen. This is one of the modes of deceiving the public.
Whenever an Englishman has a craving for popularity among the Hindus, he knows how to espouse
the cause of India when an Indian question crops up in Parliament. The moment he does so, our
educated people begin to dance with joy and dub him as the defender of the cause of India. If he
afterwards visits India, they will draw his carriage and have illuminations and processions in his
honour. And they think that by doing so the welfare of the country is gained. I remember having
seen two or three such celebrations in honour of Europeans. We two brothers felt exasperated at
these sights. Just as Arjun after enjoying himself at Dwarka under the disguise of a sanyasi, carried
away Subhadra in the end, so these Englishmen, having come to India, deceive the people and
carry away to their country the prize of great glory. The only difference is that, while the people of
Dwarka recognized in the disguised sanyasi the cunning Arjun after Subhadra had been taken
away, our educated classes fail, to understand the true character (of these men). Otherwise, none
of them would have had a blind regard for the English. Let that pass.
### THE POONA CONGRESS
The National Congress having been held this year in Poona itself, we had an opportunity of
personally witnessing the great efforts of our educated classes in the interests of our country. An
influential gentleman from Madras by the name of Manmohan Ghosh, or some such other name
which I do not remember (had come down to Poona) and was working heart, and soul in the cause
of Congress. He is a great devotee of the Congress. It is his special characteristic that, though a
Hindu by religion he dresses like
983a European from top to toe, and shaves his moustache like a eunuch. Had he been a fair-looking
man this European dress might have looked graceful, but being of dark complexion and having no
moustache, he presented a very-queer appearance in that attire. He looked just as if he were a
pervert. He had a European to drive his carriage, and had to pay him a salary of Rs. 500 a month. In
this particular, above ail others, is his love of his country seen to the greatest advantage. (The
reason) is simple. While engaged in promoting the welfare of the country innumerable obstacles are
sure to arise in one's way and consequently charioteering skill of no common order is requisit for
surmounting them. As, however, such skilful men are not to be found in India they must needs be
imported from England. Here, however, a doubt crosses our mind. How can a country whch cannot
furnish a skilful charioteer produce a warrior fitted to sit on a chariot ? The status of the latter is
considerable higher than that of the former. When I first saw this man driving in his carriage, I
mistook the driver for Ghose and Ghose himself for the lackey. Let that, however, pass. This
incarnation of patriotism had come (to Poona) in advance (of the Congress) to assist the Poonaites
in their preparations. All the Brahmins in our city, both young and old, including the school-boys,
were also heartily exerting themselves (in the Congress movement). I must, however, explain here
what the expression " exerting oneself " means ; for, in other lands, the expression " exerting
oneself for the good of one's country" is understood to have a significance different from what it had
in this country. The people of these lands might be led to think that our patriots, reckless of their
lives, must have prepared themselves to die for the good of their country. But that would be a wrong
impression. The brave patriots: from all parts of the country who had congregated in the city of
Poona on this occasion were received at the railway station by the volunteers, who, taking up their
baggage and (even) their shoes in their hands, guided them with such words as these. " Sir, place
your foot here carefully, there is a stone in front," to a small but handsome pavillion erected near the
station, and here their first adoration took place. The guests were served with fruits, tea and coffee
to their heart's content and garlands of fragrant flowers were put round their necks. Then they were
taken in tongas to the small rooms built near the Congress pavilion for their use and asked to sit on
the mattresses of small but neatly made bedsteads. These rooms contained all conveniences. I do
not know whether women too were provided there, but every article of food and drink was ready at
hand. There was plenty of every kind of prohibited food and drink. Warm-water shower-baths were
also there, and after our patriots had seated themselves on beautiful square slabs in the bath-
rooms, warm-water showers poured down on their heads. And so they proceeded to bring about the
country's good. At night electric lamps were lit, and in their moon-like refulgence these patriots
wandered about and thus advanced the good of the country. Their national darbar was held during
the day, and on that occasion the veteran patriots were lustily cheered when they entered the
pavilion. Tilak was cheered, Ranade was cheered, and Surendranath Banarji was cheered, for
hours together, because, forsooth, he was the Indra, the chief of all the gods, and was, therefore
escorted by the toy regiment referred to above. After these, the best heroes had assembled, the war
of words began. But, singularly enough, their opponent, viz., the Englishman, was conspicuous by
his absence. He was represented there by some solitary black-coat. (Even) this sight was sufficient
to confound these men. who were bold only in speech. If asked by some Government official or
placed before a court of justice, they would protest against (an unfavourable) interpretation being
placed upon their speeches, and would engage a pleader at some expense to defend themselves.
Alas!
984MY COUNTRYMEN, BEWARE OF THE CONGRESS
Oh my countrymen, how have you been reduced to such a helpless condition ! How is it that
your intellect is incapable of thinking aright ! When Shivaji, Bajirao, Nana Phadnavis and other
ancestors of yours determined to advance the good of their country, were they ever required to take
the advice of either Hume or Bradlaugh ? When those worthy personages made determined efforts
to get their rights from the Yavanas, did they achieve their end by gathering together Banias and
traders, and seths and bankers, from all parts of the country in a national pavilion, illuminated with
electric lights and erected on the plain of Chaturshingi, and by indulging in loquacity by day and
lounging upon sofas by night ? How you ever read that such was the case ? If you contend that it
was the National Congress that has done good to America, I have already traversed that argument
on the last page. Though I can neither speak nor read English, the information I have collected on
the subject is reliable, and I can write very extensively on this topic. I, however, stated here in short
what I have to say : " My friends, be mindful of the old adage, ' Wisdom is powerless before
authority.' You should, therefore, adapt yourselves (to the ways of your rulers) and thus accomplish
whatever good you can. Even if they imposed taxes upon you, submit to them with the thought that
they are foreigners after all. Tall talk and writing articles in newspapers will be of no avail against
them. If you are unable to bear the oppression of these foreigners, then give up all hope of your life,
wealth, relations, friends and acquaintances, sons and wives, and make a demand for your rights
and support it with physical force. I, however, do not think that you are capable of achieving that.
Because had you possessed that ability, you would have long before this understood the matter. Do
not render yourselves liable to punishment with hard labour by indulging in vain talk and by using
your pens against Englishmen. Do not glory in so doing. If you shower flowers on one who has been
sentenced for simply indulging in tall talk, what will you do to discharge your obligations to a warrior
like Shivaji should he be fortunately born in this country ? I ask this question because you have
already conferred all kinds of honour on persons of ordinary abilities. Nay, you have honoured such
insignificant persons as Surendranath Sanarji, Dadabhai Navroji, Hume and others in a manner
Shivaji was not honoured during his time. Do you think nothing remains to be done for the good of
the country beyond this ? You are mistaken. A little consideration will teach you the lesson
conveyed by the adage 'A thunder-cloud produces no rain, a talkative man will not act.' I ask you to
consider this adage and proceed with my narrative." The sight of this national festival grieved us
very much. We had even planned to burn down its pavilion. But considering (that the institution had
gained) popular favour, we thought it would not be right to do so. Had the Social Conference been
held in that pavilion, we would certainly have made an attempt to set it on fire, but our initial
experiment having compelled the Conference to wind up its belongings, we spent our days only in
observing carefully the inconsistent proceedings (of the Congress).
### WE TURNED TO MISSIONARIES
After its puerile game was over, all the patriots left for their respective places. Then we began
to harass the missionaries. While we were at Bombay, we used to annoy in various ways the
European missionaries who were to be seen (preaching) at the Back Bay. We pelted them with
stones (and) created an uproar. Once we snatched away a hand-bag from a European ledy who
was there. We found in it some English books, some visiting cards bearing her name, a bunch of
keys and a beautiful purse. The last was a very convenient article, but we found in it (only) one pice
and a postal stamp
985worth two annas and a half. We went and saw the bungalow of this lady who resides at Grant Road.
Once we took away the sign-board of the Church Mission Hall on the Palva Road and burnt it. After
coming down to Poona, we determined to harass the European missionaries at this place. On
inquiry we learnt that they used tn preach in the upper storey of a building occupied by Messrs.
Philips and Company. There, in the first instance, I advised my Aryan brethren not to go upstairs.
and several of my friends accordingly desisted from going there. When their time of preaching
arrived, there was not a soul present at the place and so the missionaries were in a fix. The men
whom I had prevented from going there had not returned to their homes, but were standing together
on the road. When the missionaries, who were on the upper storey, came to know that a particular
individual had prevented all persons from going up there, they came down to me and said that I was
doing an unlawful act and that they would prosecute me. After this they had a conversation with the
Police and it appeared as if they were going to carry out their intentions. I, therefore, slipped away
from the place, and considering that such attempts were futile, resolved to make a desperate effort
(to gain our object).
### MY EFFORT TO BURN THE BUILDING
With a view to prevent all persons from giving any place to these (missionaries) we began to
devise plans to set the said building on fire. The staircase leading to the storey opens on the main
Budhwar Road. It has got one door at its foot and another at the top. The missionaries, when
leaving the place, used to lock the latter door, while they merely chained the former. We, therefore,
determined to open the door at the foot of the staircase and to slip away after having set fire to the
upper one. Lest what was going on inside might be clearly observed through a latticed window
above the lower door by the people outside, we hit upon the following plan by which the flames were
to blaze up inside after we had left the place. We took a big uparna and having saturated it with
kerosene oil firmly attached it to the upper door. To this uparna we tied a long strip of cloth similarly
saturated, and having stretched it for a long distance along the ground placed hollow tiles upon it in
a line, so as to form a sort of tunnel. The (other end of the) strip peeped a little out of this tunnel.
Our object was to set fire to this end and then to slip away. The tiles were to prevent the light of the
burning strip from being seen outside and there being a lack of air there, the strip was to burn slowly
and set fire to the cloth (attached to the door) after we had gone a considerable distance. To carry
out this plan, we first of all sent a friend of ours named Bhuskute upstairs, and we two disguised as
Mavlas, sat below eating fried rice, in order to protect him. Thinking that it would be found difficult to
extinguish the fire if the lower door were locked while leaving the place we purchased a lock for four
pice and gave it to Bhuskute when he went upstairs. But that being the first occasion of its kind, he
got confounded and having bungled the work came down and told us that he had done all. We,
therefore, told him to go home and walked about (in the street) waiting to witness the fun. But we
heard no alarm of fire. When an hour elapsed, we were convinced that the bungler had certainly
failed to set fire (to the place). I, therefore, went upstairs, while my brother remained below. I
returned after having set fire to the strip. Then we went away, having locked the door. We had not
proceeded far when we heard a fire bugle. Just as we reached home, we also caught the sound of
the bugle of the fire-engine located near our house, but after a short while, a telephonic message
was received announcing that the fire had been extinguished. We were much disheartened at this
news, because our attempt had not proved as successful as we had wished. On inquiry we
986learnt that as the padlock which had been attached to the lower door was a worthless one, Dagdu
confectioner, a gymnast of our city, forced it open by breaking the lock. How long could a padlock
worth only one anna hold out ? This weak point in our plans was due to our inability to spend more
upon the padlock. After this, we sent a warning to the owner of the house to evict the missionaries,
as otherwise the attempt (at incendiarism) v/as sure to be repeated some other day. As we were
fired with an ambition to follow a military career we were unceasingly exerting ourselves (to gain our
object).
THE NON-BRAHMIN MOVEMENT SPONSORED BY GOVERNMENT
We went to the old market every Sunday and Wednesday and accosted the native soldiers
visiting that place, with a view to elicit information from them on this subject of special interest to us.
I had given up conversing with the Mavathas among them, as Englishmen have fairly imbued their
minds with the idea that the Brahmins were the cause of their ruin. My intelligent readers are
doubtless aware of the existence at Poona and Bombay of a large anti-Brahmin association founded
by one Jotiba Fule. The sole aim of this association is to stir up hatred against the Brahmins among
all other castes. Its members are always moving about the country, delivering lectures to create a
feeling of animosity against the Brahmins. Their principal organ is the Din Bandhu, a weekly
newspaper, published in Bombay. It's columns are usually filled with the abuse of Brahmins. On the
death of Jotiba Fule, one Lokhande took up the lead in the matter This Lokhande, although a
perfect numskull, has been honoured with the distinction of a Justice of the Peace by Englishmen
for the simple reason that he has undertaken this important task of creating dissensions among his
own countrymen. Careful observers will see that most English people assist these men in the above
manner. But the Deccan Brahmins alone are so (spitefully) dealt with. It will upon inquiry be found
that no people in India are so greatly devoted to politics and are so persistent in applying their
intelligence and ardour in that direction as the Deccan Brahmins are. The foreigners, therefore,
deeming it to be inadvisable that the public should view with favour these scheming men, have by
conferring honours upon such ignorant people made them adopt this attitude (of hostility to
Brahmins). There is no doubt about this. This suicidal policy of theirs has been, is, and will be the
cause of great detriment to us and will greatly benefit the foreigners.
### BRAHMINS WRONGLY CHARGED
On this occasion I deem it necessary to controvert their opinions in this place. It is the stock
argument of these ignorant men that the Brahmins lost the (Maratha) kingdom and that they are
selfish. On the strength of these two charges they abuse the Brahmins to their heart's content. The
first charge about losing the (Maratha) kingdom is based on the maladministration of the country by
Bajirao the Second. It must be within the memory of students of history that this Bajirao allowed
foreigners to swallow up (his kingdom) by feasting Brahmins and by indulging in vicious habits. This
Bajirao had never earned, and will never earn hereafter, a good name among Brahmins. There is no
difference of opinion as to the fact that his acts were highly reprehensible and ruinous to the
interests of the country. But I ask these Brahmin-haters (the following questions) : Were the Maratha
Sardars, such as Scindia, Holkar, Gaikwad, Bhosle, Satarkar and Kolhapurkar, dead and gone at
the time Bajirao lost his kingdom ? Or, being alive were they, with bangles on their hands and sadis
round their bodies, shamefaeedly hiding themselves in their harems ? Or, had they become
eunuchs by divesting themselves of their moustaches ? What was the matter with
987them ? The Maratha States cover nearly the whole of India, and yet how was it that they were not
ashamed, on that occasion, to throw down their swords, shake hands with Englishmen, and declare
themselves to be their friends ? If Bajirao was really loose in his morals, why did they not protest
(against his conduct), throw him into prison and install a capable ruler on the throne ? On the
contrary, while the far-seeing Nana Phadnavis was repeatedly advising them not to ruin the country
by placing this dastardly Bajirao on the throne, it was the Scindia of Gwalior who espoused his
cause and installed him. This explains who it was ihat lost the kingdom. Although all of them were
the Sardars of the Peshwa, they treacherously sided with the English and thus kept their State
intact. How will they answer for this ingratitude ? All the Native States that are at present to be seen
in India owe their existence to their disloyalty to their sovereign as well as to their treachery in siding
with the English. Otherwise, the English would have swallowed them up long ago. Perhaps some
might say that they fell off from Bajirao because he was not a good sovereign. To such people I ask
the question as to what they would have said of Moropant Peshwa, had he gone over to the side of
Aurangzeb because of Sambhaji's misconduct. If the history of the calamities which befell the
country in the reign of Sambhaji, and after his death be read, it would convince you that those times
were a hundredfold more troublous than the times of Bajirao. It is but proper to eulogize those who
with perservance strenuously exerted themselves as for the welfare of their country during those
times.
### THE LESSON OF 1857 RISING
If Scindia and Holkar, who styled themselves the Sardars of the Peshwa, had exerted
themselves as strenuously then, they would not have been reduced to their present plight and
exposed themselves to censure. Is there a single descendant of the Peshwas, who ware the real
sovereigns of the country, now living in ignominy under a foreign yoke ? Bajirao handed over the
kingdom to the English, and having retired to Brahmavarta passed his life there in devotion ; but his
adopted son, Dhondopant Nana, as if with a view to wipe off the stigma cast on his father's name,
distinguished himself on the battlefield and departed to the other world along with his friends Bala
Saheb, Rao Saheb, Tatya Tope and Lakshmibai of Jhansi. Had Scindia and Holkar not resorted to
treachery on that occasion they as well as ourselves (Brahmins) would not have been reduced to
this plight. Even a Brahmin lady fought at that time, while men with beards and moustaches, whose
ancestors served their masters with true whole-heartedness, fell off from their master's son and
went over to the English, the enemy of their sovereign, of their religion, and of their country. Could
the meanness of the Marathas go further ? Think over this and do net needlessly raise a hue and
cry against Brahmins.
### THERE ARE BLACK SHEEP IN ALL CASTES
I do not mean to say that Brahmins have no black sheep amongst them. Like other castes
they too have their black sheep. Are there no Marathas among you of the type of the Brahmin Natus
who having gone over to the English are now enjoying a life of pleasure ? How many instances do
you want ? As a rule, all those who are at present eating the crumbs of ease under the cool shadow
of the English did at one time turn ungrateful to the Peshwa and were thus guilty of treason. They
come from all classes and castes—Brahmins, Marathas and Mussalmans. There is no reason for
one of them to laugh at the others. Was not the ruler of Hyderabad independent at that time ? Why
then did he remain indifferent ? Was it because of the Brahmin Bajirao ? Is there any Brahmin
agency at work in Manipur, Burma and similar other States which are now being swallowed up by
the English ?
988You revile the Brahmins without any reason. I for my part find fault with our evil stars.
Infatuation precedes all (evil) things. Accordingly, divergent counsels having prevailed among the
different Native States of India. The English could easily do what they liked.
### THE REVOLUTIONARIES ARE BRAHMINS
Who should blame whom in this matter ? I, for my part, blame one and all. They, and they
alone, who laid down their lives on the battlefield in measuring their swords with the English are free
from any blame. Such worthy men are to be found only among the Brahmins. Even if you look to the
present times, you will be convinced of what I say. In 1857, Nana Saheb, (showed himself to be a
Brahmin of this type), then Wasudev Balwant, and after that we two brothers, Damodar and
Balkrishna Hari Chapekar. Excepting these, has any Maratha or Muhammadan become a martyr for
his religion and his country ? According to the adage " The master is reduced to distress while
thieves roll in plenty," the Peshwas have passed away, while these ingrates are still living and
enjoying the jaghirs conferred upon them by the Peshwas. What sort of hell might have been
created for (the punishment) of such men ? I do not wish to say anything further about these
ungrateful wretches; for, my blood boils whenever I think of their treacherous deeds, and I much
regret that we could not wreak our vengeance upon them. We were burning with rage at Dinkarrao
Rajwade, the late Diwan of Scindia. But we were disappointed when a few days ago we heard that
he was dead. Now of course the execution of all our designs must be deferred to our next existence.
May Heaven fulfil our desires in our future lives ! The second charge remains yet to be refuted, but I
do not wish to enlarge upon that insignificant point here. In connection with this matter, I
recommend my readers to peruse the criticism of the late Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar on the "
Lokahitavadi." Therein he has ably dealt with the subject. In short, this anti-Brahmin spirit has
spread amongst people of all castes. From my personal experience I know that this feeling is very
strong among the Deccan Marathas employed in the regiments.
### I MEET A MARATHA SUBEDAR
I was well acquainted with Kashinath Baneh, the Subhedar Major of the 4th (Infantry)
Regiment. At my first visit to him he asked me what I had come lor. I said to him, "I am very fond of
a military carrer. Can I be enrolled (in your regiment)". Thereupon that man knit his brows, and
giving an emphatic nasal twang to his voice said to me in the Konkani dialect, " Bhatji Bova, what
you say is true, but how will you be able to observe the customs of your caste in the regiment ? A
regiment is not a place for eating sweetmeat balls. Look at my feet, and see how very bronzed they
have become. This is the way we are required to move about (from place to place) ; we alone can
do that." He philosophied much in this fashion, but as I had no desire to argue with him I quietly
heard what he said. I tickled him with the following words : " Subhedar Saheb, what a brave man
you are !, Certainly you are the men to fight battles. Your bronzed feet strike me with wonder. What
toil you must have undergone !" I tickled him in this manner, but at the same time taunted him as
follows : " Did the Peshwas observe the customs of their caste when they crossed the Attock ? Was
it by tasting sweetmeat balls that they confounded the Persians ? " At this the Subhedar softened
his tone and said, " I do not mean that; I only wanted to say that it is not possible to observe the
caste customs in a regiment." I thus made various attempts to get myself enlisted in the army. But
as the Deccan Maratha sepoys used to deride and jeer at us, I refused to see them any more.
989EFFORT TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
We sought information about regimental matters by making friends with native soldiers (of
other castes). None of them, however, encouraged us in our desire to enlist in the army. They used
to tell us that it was through their ill-luck that they got themselves enlisted in the army. We did not
however, appreciate what they said and so vigorously prosecuted our efforts, which, however,
proved futile. We were thus helpless in the matter. We then directed our efforts towards
Hindustan(sic). We had interviews with many influential persons at Baroda, Gwalior, Indore.
Hyderabad, Sangli, &c. and expressed to them our desire to serve in a cavalry regiment. But each
one of them declined to do anything for us. Then we applied to the Portuguese Government at Goa,
but were not favoured with a reply. Afterwards some one explained to us the futility of applying to
subordinate European officers, and advised us to address the Commander-in-Chief at Simla, where
our request would be favourably considered. Four times did I address the Commander-in-Chief in
the matter and received replies to my petitions, but they were all to no purpose. In other words, all
the replies were of a negative character. I have handed over copies of them to my friends, Brewin
and Kennedy. I have also got (a copy of) the application which I sent to the Chief of Sangli. I desire
that all these should be printed hereafter.
### DESIRE TO GO TO NEPAL
On receiving such a sour reply from Simla, we thought that it would be far better to settle in a
foreign country than to remain in one where liberty did not exist even in so small a measure.
Therefore knowing Nepal to be an independent country, my brother (determined to) set out for it.
We were under the impression that our parents would not allow us to go to such a distant country,
as hitherto we had never left them to follow our own inclinations. But now we thought we would be
wasting away the very prime of our lives if we were to remain inactive. We also thought it
undesirable to delay our plans as it was necessary that the art of war which we aspired to learn
should be studied while one possessed a strong physique. But another difficulty as to how to
arrange for our parents in our absence presented itself. Being conscious that it was our duty not to
forsake them, we decided that I should remain at home and my brother should proceed to Nepal for
the achievement of our purpose. There he was to arrange everything for both of us and then inform
me of his having done so. We then fixed an auspicious day for (his) departure. All the members of
our family were quite happy at this time. Readers ! my father's profession of kirtan enabled him to
earn plenty of money. He was liberal in his expenditure, and so every holiday was well enjoyed. As
my father was very hospitable to his guests, there was scarcely a day on which we did not partake
of sweetmeats with our guests and friends. Our family having increased by the grace of God, our
happiness also increased in the same proportion. It is a fact to be particularly remembered that our
family possessed in a full measure that affection (for one another) which is the source of all
domestic happiness. I have seen a good many families, but have never come across a single one
which is free from domestic quarrels. Fire seize their other comforts ! There are many who possess
wealth, and are also blessed with large families, but no two members of the family live in harmony.
Such, however, was not the case with our family. All those who were younger than myself were
obedient to me, and they never showed any disrespect to me. I do not know how I can requite them
for all this. May Heaven bless them ! My family thus consisted of my loving brothers and sisters, my
father and
990mother, and my wife and son ; but the actions of our former existence having given a peculiar turn to
our predilections, our minds deviated from all domestic concerns and took a different direction.
### BALKRISHNA STARTS BUT HAS TO RETURN
An auspicious day having been fixed for my brother's departure to Nepal, he took with him
Rs. 40 for his travelling expenses. This amount had been accumulated by us laying aside small
sums of money for this long journey. He also took with him other necessary things. As we had
settled that my brother should start by the morning train, both of us left our beds early in the morning
and adored the Deity, and prayed to Him that as we were leaving (the city) with a good object in
view, He should vouchsafe success to us. Then considering my seniority in age, I gave him some
advice, after which I was for a moment plunged in sadness at the thought of (our impending)
seperation. As the members of our family had never before seperated from each other, this
(seperation) was found by us to be extremely unbearable. Besides, the affection mutually felt by us
was not like that felt by other brothers for each other. My brother saluted me, made a mental (sic)
obeisance to our parents, uttered the name of Gajanan and stepped out of the house. Having gone
as far as Budhwar (Peth) to see him off, I returned, My mind, however, was filled with sadness, and
it having occurred to me that contrary to the rules laid down in the Shastras he had set out on a
journey without taking any companion with him, I prayed that God might keep him happy. I then
came home. At 10 O'clock in the morning, as my brother was not present at dinner-time, my father
suspected that he must have gone to some (distant) place. My father being very astute could at
once divine (the motive of) our conduct. Our mother was indeed of an unsuspecting nature, but our
father gave her to understand that Balkrishna had left home for some (unknown) place. Thereupon
she persisted in saying that I knew his whereabouts and refused to eat anything unless I brought
him back by writing to him. I told her that he had not apprised me of his departure. But would she
believe it? How could our parents, who knew our daily mode of life, believe what I told them ? Then I
thought that I had not acted properly in remaining behind. I could not bear to hear my mother's
lamentations. But what could I do ? Wishing to get out of the difficulty any how, I assured her that he
had gone to Baroda, and made her take her meal. My mother importuned me daily (to give
information about my brother), but every day I basely deluded her with some fresh explanation. Our
parents led a moral life and I was heartily grieved to have abandoned them and caused them
trouble. Every one in the town would ask me where my brother had gone, and I would reply that he
had gone to Baroda, in search of employment. In this manner about fifteen days elapsed, but I
received no letter giving any account of his health, &c. This circumstance caused me great anxiety.
One day, however, I unexpectedly received a telegram, requesting me to remit Rs. 25 to him by a
telegraphic money-order. The perusal thereof removed my anxiety, as I learnt from it that my brother
was in good health. I then began to guess why he wanted money. That, however, was no proper
time for (idle) conjectures, and so I began to consider how I might procure the requisite amount.
Though a perusal of our lives would lead the reader to suppose that we were expert thieves, we
never unjustly took a single chhadam from any one. On the contrary, in money matters we obliged
others, but never incurred any debt ourselves. Not being addicted to any vice we never wanted
money. If we at all wanted money, it was for the good of the country. As we thus lived a life of
probity, we had considerable credit with the people. I was sure that my request for money would not
be refused by any one (of our friends). Accordingly, when I asked for the said amount of one of our
991friends he at once paid it. I heartily thanked him for this and at once remitted the amount by a
telegraphic money-order to my brother's address at the Allahabad Post Office according to his
instructions. From my brother's (continued) absence my father concluded that I, his" eldest son,
would also follow him, and even sent letter to that effect., to his friends and acquaintances. Not
having received any letters from my brother for fifteen days after I had remitted the said amount to
him, I became anxious, when one day, as I awoke at dawn, I heard my dear brother's voice, to my
great delight. First of all I devoutly thanked God on seeing my brother in sound health. I was
especially delighted at the thought that my mother would rejoice (at my brother's return).
Accordingly, when she saw Balkrishna that morning her face plainly indicated the joy felt by her.
Then on the second or third day after my brother's return, I asked him to give an account of what
had occurred at the place to which he had gone. This he did in detail. I think that the high hopes
which we had entertained about Nepal were wholly destroyed. I wish that my brother should himself
write an account of the perilous position in which he had found himself. I, therefore, omit it from this
narrative. After this, we determined to accomplish our object by remaining in our country, regardless
of consequences. We also determined never to abandon our parents. Having pondered over what
we should do next, I said to my brother that we might make one more application (to Government),
stating. " Since you decline to appoint to suitable posts men like ourselves, who are fond of the art
of war, how should we gratify our desire ? Should we rebel ? " Considering that the making of such
an application would be tantamount to open hostility, we decided that since the English were our
implacable enemies and the cause of our subjection, we should commit as many hostile acts
against them as we could. This was the first and the most potent cause of the enmity between the
English and ourselves.
### THE SHIVAJI CELEBRATION
Just at this time, the first occasion on which the anniversary of Shivaji's birth was to be
celebrated with festivities approached. My brother and myself do not at all like this festival. Such
undertakings as involved a great deal of talk highly exasperated us. Besides, some features of the
festival held in honour of Shivaji are so extravagant that he himself would not have liked them. In the
first place, he would not at all have approved of the custom of celebrating the anniversary of his
birth as it was tentamount to placing him on en equal footing with God. For though he was a most
ambitious man, and this was natural, since he who would expose his life to such dangers would do
so only for glory, he would not have insisted on being worshipped like God. Even his preceptor, Shri
Samarth Ramdas, was not considered worthy of being ranked with God. How could then Shivaji, his
disciple, at once attain such rank ? No jayanti is celebrated in honour of Ramdas. Only his punyatith
is celebrated. A jayanti is celebrated only in commemoration of the incarnation assumed by God at
various times. It cannot be celebrated in connection with any other event. If the custom of
celebrating jayantis of men be once introduced, any one will be able to celebrate a jayanti in honour
cf any one he likes. It will be possible to celebrate a jayanti in honour of even Tilak and Agarkar.
We, therefore, do not at all like that these wiseacres should, by holding a festival in honour of
Shivaji, raise him to the rank of God. The first of such festivals was celebrated- in Natus' Garden in
Sadashiv Peth. We attended the festivities, but were much grieved to see the childishness of our
people. We could not endure that all people, old and young, should behave in a puerile manner
instead of taking such a lesson from Shivaji's
992life as they ought to have. My brother, therefore, composed two shloks, which are excellent. We
learnt them by heart at the opportune moment and recited them at a meeting at which a vehement
discussion took place between Jinsiwale and the reformer Bhau. These shloks also referred to
loqacious men like Jinsiwale and Bhau. The shloks recited at the gathering held in honour of Shivaji
are as follows :—
"No one has ever heard of the lofty trees of lipbravery bearing good fruit; kissing a
woman's lips in a dream never produced offspring; you may speak, but do not thunder like
clouds which give no showers; a woman's counsel, being unaccompanied by prowess, is
ridiculed by the world; merely reciting Shivaji's story like a bard does not secure—
independence ; it is necessary to be prompt in engaging in desperate enter prises like Shivaji
and Baji ; knowing this you goad people take up swords and shields at all events now. Rap
your upper arms (like wrestlers) and we shall cutof countless heads of enemies."
On reading the above shloks some one may ask. " You find fault with others, but what have
you yourselves done ? " Many persons privately asked us the above question. Considering that if
we were asked it in a full assembly it would be incumbent upon us to make our vow known to the
public, my brother composed the following shlok anent our vow :—
" Listen. We shall risk our lives on the battle-field in a national war. Do not look upon
our utterances in the presence of many people as a mere farce. We shall assuredly shed
upon the earth the life-blood of the enemies who destroy (our) religion. We shall die after
killing only. While you yourselves will hear the story like women ? "
### RECITATIONS IN GANAPATI FESTIVAL
The recitation of the above shloks during the Shivaji festival was followed by loud cheers (a).
After this I also composed some shloks intended to be recited during the Ganpati festival at
Bombay. I have already stated that after our hopes of getting enlisted in some regiment where
completely destroyed, we became implacable enemies of the English. The drift of all our shloks will
be found to be simply this : "Do not talk that idly, (but) do something." In the Ganpati festival we two
brothers put on masculine attire and accompanied our recitations with such gestures as were
calculated to properly impress the drift of our shloks upon the minds of the assembled people. The
shloks referred to are as follows :—
" Fools, what is the use of your being men ? Of what use are your big moustaches ?
Alas. You are not ashamed to remain in servitude; try, therefore, to commit suicide. Alas. Like
butchers the wicked in their monstrous atrocity kill calves and kine. Free her (the cow) from
her trouble, die (but) kill the English. Do not remain idle and (thereby) burden the earth. This
is called Hindustan (land of the Hindus). How is it that the English rule here ? It is a great
shame. Do not forget (your) name. Dearly cherish patriotism in your minds) Rise, rap your
upper arms, encounter (the enemies). May you succeed in slaughtering the wicked. How
valiant were our forefathers on the battlefield. They died after winning glory in the defence of
their country. We who have sprung from them are like Saturn whom the Sun has produced.
We are not ashamed though our kingdom has been wrested (from us)."
993MY ESTIMATE OF TILAK AND KHARE
Whenever we recited the above shloks we were cheered. Some people warned us that
though what we recited was true, we should be cautious as there were detective policemen among
the assembled people. Though we recited the above shloks only at four or five places in Bombay,
that was sufficient to make us the subject of popular talk for a long time(b). We then returned to
Poona. One day I went alone to the A'nandodbhava Theatre to hear a lecture annually delivered
there. Tilak graced the presidential chair. Seeing Daji Abaji Khare rise to deliver a speech about
Shivaji, the cow protector, I flew into a rage. I consider it a disgrace that a vile cow-eater, who ate
beef in company with Muhammadans, should deliver a speech about Shivaji the cow-protector, and
that the audience should quietly listen to him. Accordingly I said to some mischiefmakers who were
sure to reduce a new speaker to a miserable plight : " Friends, mischief-making is reprehensible.
But if you indulge in it on an exceptional occasion like the present one, it would reflect credit on the
Hindu community to which you belong." Though I made the above request in various ways, none of
the blockheads would accede to it. Thereupon I resolved to insult Khare, whom I considered to be a
disgrace to our religion, by reciting a shlok which I had composed about him. Accordingly, I
approached the speaker's platform, where sat the leading reformers and non-reformers. Some one
having told me that if I intended to speak I should first obtain the manager's permission to do so, I
requested the manager, by name Mande, to grant it. He, however, refused it. Caring little or his
refusal, I advanced with the intention of reciting the shlok. A serious altercation then took place
between the manager and myself, and at last some Brahmin wrestler was sent to drive me out.
Readers, I had till then neither put up with the slightest insult nor gone to any place where I did not
expect to be treated with consideration. I, therefore, leave it to you to imagine how intolerable must
have been this insult offered in full assembly to me, who am so jealous of my honour. I was so
greatly incensed that I longed to make the educated brutes at once feel what dishonour is and at the
same time to let them know how men of honour act. These professors of law have a notion that
every case is to disposed of by a court of justice. They do not know for whom laws are made. I
wished to make these modern scholars knew that he who can secured all his rights by the strength
of his arm has no occasion to resort to a court of justice. I wished to deal the wrestler, who had
come to seize me by the arm and drive me out, a blow on the head with the stick in my hand so as
to let him understand that his artful twists would not prove serviceable to him on every occasion,
and then to punish Tilak, the president of the meeting, who had sent him (to drive me out). Many of
my readers will, on reading this, feel indignant and say that I am not a patriot but an enemy of my
country. Poor fellows. Let them say it. I know that many people have a good opinion of Tilak, but
they must be devoid of reason. In my opinion, according to the saying, " Alas (he is) neither a Hindu
nor a Yavan. " Tilak is neither a thorough reformer nor is he thoroughly orthodox. For if we were to
credit him with devotion to his own religion, (we must remember that) he is a member of the
association for the removal of obstacles in the way of widow-remarriage. This sanctimonious
individual is the dear friend of the beef-eater Daji Abaji Khare (donkey), to whose house he-goes
occasionally and with whom he takes meals without any hesitation. This worthy individual was
ashamed to undergo expiration for eating biscuits, but was not ashamed to take tea. Had he
consented to have his moustache shaved off in deference to popular opinion, would forty
generations (of his ancestors) have been consigned to hell ? He tried to place himself on a footing
of equality with the authors of the Smritis by introducing certain innovations in the marriage ritual. I
do not think that any one had ever seen him performing such pious acts as hearing a kirtan or
994puran or visiting a temple. He did many other similar acts which would be disgraceful to any man
calling himself religious. I have mentioned (only) some of them. Owing to these acts we have no
good opinion of him. We, however, consider him to be a far better man than a reformer. Latterly, he
had adapted his manners to the opinions of his community and this had considerably checked his
irregular conduct. We hoped that after some time he would be much improved.
### I DECIDE NEVER TO ATTEND ANY PUBLIC MEETING
In short, we Chapekars are the slaves of those who are sincerely devoted to their religion, but
the implacable enemies of those who are not so. Besides, it was natural that an insult offered in a
full assembly to a haughty man like myself, without any consideration of my worth, should incense
me. When the above thought occured to me, I closed my eyes for a little while and questioned God
who resides in my heart, "Oh God, how should I act in my present condition ?" He inspired me as
follows : " You, who are desirous of cleaving your enemies ' hearts, have become ready to strike
men of your own caste. (But) take heed. You will not succeed in this. It was through ignorance that
they insulted you. They do not know you." On learning the will of God' to the above effect, I at once
left the meeting before the wrestler could seize my hand. I was much dejected for the next two or
four days. After my brother and myself had held a consultation, we vowed never to go from that day
to any meeting held in connection with any question of public interest. This vow proved of great use
to us. As we were not seen taking part in any wild scheme affecting the public we ceased to be
reckoned among the well-wishers of the country- a result which was very beneficial to us.
### MY POEMS ATTACHED BY POLICE
Afterwards, according to our practice every year, we went to Bombay for spending the four
monsoon months there. As we were often badly in want of money, it occurred to me, after some
consideration of the matter, that I might offer for sale a book designed for the use of the Ganpati
melas of that year. Accordingly, I composed one such book and took it to the Suvarna Printing
Press for being printed. As might have been expected from our temperament, the tone of the book
was rather severe. Before it was printed the proprietor of the Press altered it in some places. As it
attracted the notice of the Bombay Police, they attached all the copies of the book found in the
Suvarna Printing Press and ordered me to be present in the Police (Commissioner's) Office the next
day. Some copies of the (said) book had (already) been sold. In the evening a detective policeman
came to my residence in Vithalvadi under the pretext of buying (some) books, (but really) to
ascertain whether I had got any more copies of it. But in accordance with the saying " Set a thief to
catch a thief" we recognised him and prevented him from obtaining any material information. Next
day I had to appear before Vincent in the Police office. As the Police are discourteous, I, in order to
avoid being insulted by them, most humbly prayed to God to preserve my honour, and then went
with the proprietor of the said press (to the Police Commissioner's Office). The Police directly took
us before Vincent. Inspector Roshan Ali and Jamadar Lakshman, of the Dectective Police, were
present there. The proprietor of the said press was first examined and Mr. Vincent made many
cutting remarks about him. Hearing this, I became apprehensive that he might abuse me in the
same manner and that a serious altercation might take place between us. But I am very glad to
state that owing to the miraculous power of God, he questioned me very calmly and with a smiling
face As I answered his questions with much adroitness he was pleased with
995me, and told me that my books had been temporarily attached and that I might take them back after
the Ganpati festival was over. This gave me much relief. This case taught us the lesson that we
should never do anything likely to attract the notice of the Police. I had sent another poem (to the
press) for being printed,but in view of the fate of my first book I revoked the the order for printing it.
### WE BEAT PROF. VELANKAR FOR HIS CONVERSION
We then became anxious as to what we should do in order to acquire greater boldness, when
we heard that only recently an educated Hindu, who had risen to a professorship, had, as it was to
be expected from his antecedents, become an apostate and embraced Christianity. Considering him
to be a proper person on whom we might inflict punishment, we began to make inquiries about him.
We first inquired at the Wilson College where his bungalow was and afterwards saw it in person. On
considering how we might accomplish our object, we two brothers came to the conclusion that at
first one of us should see the professor and express his desire of being initiated into the Christian
religion, and by visiting him for one or two days more obtain information about his mode of life, his
family, (the time of) his going out and returning, and other more or less useful particulars, and that
further arrangements should be made afterwards. After careful consideration we decided that our
dear friend, Bhuskute who knew English well enough for practical purposes, should see the
professor and express a desire as stated above. Accordingly, we gave him elaborate instructions as
to how he was to act and sent him there. After his entrance into the bungalow we used to wait
somewhere on the outside. After learning on his return what had occurred at the interview, we used
to tutor him for the next day's visit. He had assumed the name of Kirtane. He discovered from the
expression of Velankar's face that the latter was greatly delighted to hear of Bhuskute's intention of
embracing Christianity. Bhuskute must have seen Velankar only three or four times. It was then
decided (by us) that Bhuskute should tell Velankar that as one of his friends had expressed a desire
to embrace Christinity he would introduce him to Valenkar, that my brother should accompany
Bhiskute and that he should strike Velankar on the same day. Bhiskute acted in accordance with the
above plan, and my brother, Balwantrao, went with him. We two always used to carry our offensive
weapons concealed about our persons. They two went into Velankar's bungalow and I stood on the
outside. As my brother found no favourable opportunity he abandoned his design of striking
(Velankar) on that day. A long discussion about the Christian religion took place between them and
Velankar on that day. My brother told (Velankar) that his (sur) name was Sathe. We now feel deep
regret for the serious mistake committed by my brother in assuming the above name. Had he
assumed any other name instead of the above one, the present calamity would perhaps have not
befallen us. When my brother went to see Velankar, the latter had left the bungalow which he had
rented and was living in one which he himself had built. In this manner even my brother paid two or
three fruitless visits to Velankar. He treated them with much more respect than they deserved and
manifested great affection for them. The cause of all this was that the rascally missionary, believing
that Bhuskute and my brother intended to embrace Christianity tried all means of pleasing them. He
always used to tell them " my friend Dr. Mackichan was greatly delighted to hear of your intention of
embracing Christianity and he is very eager to see you. We shall, therefore, once go to see him."
My brother, however, wishing to execute his design without letting his own face be seen by
Velankar's friends, used to put off his compliance with the said proposal by promising to go (to Dr.
Mackichan) on some future day. As the matter was thus
996progressing we fixed a day, viz., Gokul Ashtami, for executing our design without failure. On that
day we were to make Velankar undergo a slight expiation for his act (of becoming a convert). He
had given us two books for reading, viz., copies of " An Indian Youth" and the New Testament. It
was decided that the third man (i.e. myself) should also go to Velankar's house on the Gokul
Ashtami day. It was settled that I should pretend to be Sathe's brother-in-law and to have come (to
Bombay) to make inquiries about him in consequence of a rumour of his intended conversion. He
(Bhuskute) had already told Velankar that Sathe used to live at Bandra. Two days before the date
fixed Bhuskute told Velankar that Sathe's brother-in-law by name Bhide (i.e. myself), had come to
take him away, that Sathe would bring him with himself two days after by the 10 p.m. train and that
the three persons would come to his (Velankar's) house at about 11 o'clock on that night; and he,
therefore, requested him not to retire till that time. When that auspicious day came we devoutly
prayed to God as follows : Oh God, this day thou didst become incarnate as Krishna in order to
destroy the wicked, and didst slay Kamsa and Chanur. As thou hatest the wicked very much, do
thou give success to us who too have girded up our lions to destroy the wicked." Having offered this
prayer, we started from our residence at about half past 8 and went to the Grant Road Station,
where we anxiously waited for the desired opportunity. When it was just close upon half past 10 we
uttered God's name and went to Velankar's house. He was talking with some one on the upper
story. Being informed of our arrival, he after some time came downstairs with a candle-light and
entered a shed outside his bungalow. there we three entered into conversation with him. Being
introduced to him, I said, " My friend Sathe having left his family has been living here for many days.
I hear that he has now some improper idea in his head. As he has full confidence in you, you
should, by giving him proper advice, induce him to go back to and live with his family."' Hearing this
Velankar said, " Mr. Bhide, what you say is true. But every man is independent in the matter of
religion and it is a great sin to throw obstacles in his way. In my case also, when my intended
conversion became known to all, all my relatives, friends and acquaintances advised me in many
ways (to give up my intention). I, however, without earring for their advice carried out my intention.
You should not, therefore, make me act sinfully in this matter." At this I pretended to be silenced.
We then talked upon other subjects, and at last upon the story of Krishna. When Velankar, who had
disgraced his family, began to find fault with the eternal Krishna, we could not put up with it, and
Sathe struck a very severe blow with his steel-bound stick on Velankar's head and a moderately
sever one on the back. We then returned home and expressed our gratitude to God.
### WE CHEATED THE POLICE
On the next day news of the above occurence spread in all parts of Bombay, and all Hindus
and Muhammandans appeared to be greatly rejoiced at it. The Police also began to make very
searching inquiries. At 2 p.m., on the next day, a European constable with one or two (Police) peons
came to Kamat Company's chawl in which we lived, to enquire about Kirtane and Sathe. They
asked the inmates of every room whether two men by name Sathe and Kirtane respectively were
living there. On our telling them that neither of them lived there, they went away. Apprehending that
the two books in our possession (which we had received from Velankar) might serve as evidence
(against us) we burnt them. The Times (of India), the Bombay Gazette and the other English and
Marathi newspapers then began to write about this Velankar affair with vehemence. In
997these articles the Police were blamed for their inability to detect such a (serious) offence. Thereupon
the Police feeling rather ashamed began to arrest persons indiscriminately, take them to "Velankar
for identification, and release them on his failing to identify them. Apprehensive of falling into the
clutches of the Police, we determined to piay a very clever trick on them in order to mislead them.
We had already told him (Velankar) that all of as were inhabitants of Kolhapur. We now wrote in the
Balbodh character a letter to the following effect in the style of an illiterate man :—
" You sbandoned your own religion and became a convert to another and thereby
disgraced the Maratha Community to which we belong. We, therefore, inflicted a light
punishment upon you and left for Kolhapur."
In order to convince him (of the truth of the above statements) allusions were made in that
latter to the books (given to us by him) and to certain incidents in our conversation with him. We
caused Bhuskute to post it at Poona. We addressed it from Kothrud in order to make Velankar
believe that we had started for Kolhapur on foot. When it reached him he showed it to the Police
and said, " Do not make any more fruitless inquiries or bring any more men to me for identification. I
am certain that they have gone to Kolhapur.". As soon as the Police heard this, they relaxed their
efforts to our satisfaction. The English papers, however, continued to discuss the matter now and
then. Hearing that Dr. Mackichan was more exasperated than any other person, we also found out
and marked his bungalow. A few days afterwards, the bubonic plague now prevailing in the country
broke out in Bombay.
### OUR HATRED OF THE ENGLISH
In the meanwhile we again tried to get ourselves enlisted in a regiment, but failed. This was
the last disappointment suffered by us and we strongly reviled the English as follows : " A system of
administration so cruel as chat of the English cannot, if search be made, be found, in any region of
this globe. Far better were the tyrannical Yavan kings, who, with sword in hand, actually cut the
throats of men as if they were so many goats. But the English are perfidious and I positively declare
that no other people can be found on this earth who are as villainous as they and who like them ruin
others by a show of kindness. As god has given men different features, so He has endowed them
with different temperaments. Men's desires necessarily vary according to their temperaments. The
three principles of sattva (goodness or excellence), raja (passion of foulness) and tama (darkness or
ignorance) exist in a greater or less proportion in all men and are the cause of the difference
between their respective bent of mind as manifested in their conduct. If a sovereign were to act in
opposition to human disposition or inclinations implanted by God, would not that be tantamount to
ordering an innocent man, on the strength of authority, to do a particular act against his will or, in
other words, to sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment ? If he be found to entertain any immoral
desire it would be right to check him. But our request though legal, was refused. Who will call him
king who exercises such arbitrary powers ? Hitherto there have been many cruel Yavan kings in
India, but they made no rules for excluding Hindus from particular appointments or for limiting the
number of those open to them. It is a fact well-known in history that our people have even
discharged the duties of a premier requiring tact and trust worthiness. It is also possible even now to
point out the descendants of persons who served in the army and obtained jahgirs by performing
deeds of valour." These thoughts created in our minds a violent prejudice against the English and
we resolved to persecute them in future. We knew only one or two on our side, while those against
whom
998we were only to commence hostilities were far more powerful than ourselves. The difference
between them and our selves was as great as that between the sky and the regions under the earth.
Many people will ask why we formed such an absurd design as the above in the face of the rule, " In
marriage, enmity and love the parties must be each other's equals." But, friends I interpret the
above (rule of the) Shastra in a manner very different from yours. The meaning of the rule " We
should form (an alliance by) marriage with one who is our equal" is as follows : We should form it
with one who like us is highborn of a generous heart and possessed of innate good qualities,
irrespectively of his outward riches. Accordingly, I have seen several great men give their daughters
in marriage to poor but (otherwise) eligible persons and also make over their riches to them. So
also, love and enmity depend on greatness of mind. What does it matter if a man be not fortunate
enough to have riches ? He whose mind is great (Under any circumstances). Though he may have
no riches, that does not in the least detract from his greatness of mind. The wise must not forget
this. Though we are destitute of wealth, we feel proud to say that our family is noble. Our parents
are high-born, possessed of greatness of mind, generous and virtuous and we owe our origin to
them. Friends, there being at present a lack of discerning men capable of properly appreciating the
merits of our patents and ourselves, and my end having approached, I am compelled to indulge in
sell-glorification, for which I beg my Aryan brethren to excuse me. (In forming an estimate of our
merits) my friends must not confine their attention only to the fact that our father used to perform
kirtans and we used to beat tall behind him. If they make careful inquiries about the innate
disposition and outward conduct of our parents and ourselves, they will come to know the truth. In
short, though we have neither an army, nor territory, nor money, we still possess greatness of mind
and are therefore competent to pit ourselves against any being except God. Success or failure
depends upon chance and has no connection whatever with greatness.
### WE DETERMINE TO FIGHT THE ENGLISH
Taking this view, we girded up our loins to enter upon a struggle with the English. We began
to consider to what undertaking we should first put our hand. It must be a very grave one and of
such a nature that our success in accomplishing it might be the talk of all, rejoice our Aryan
brethern, fill the English with sorrow, and put upon us the indelible brand of treason. While
pondering over this, we were inspired with the following idea : There is a statue of the Queen of
England situated at a certain crossing off our roads in the Fort in Bombay. This place is an important
one. This woman, after the Mutiny of 1857, acquired the universal sovereignty of India by making
fair but deceitful promises. She alone is the real enemy of our people. Other white men are our
enemies only in so far as they are her subjects. We should, therefore, begin at this place. Other acts
(should be done) afterwards. Had she been in India we would have tried to wreck vengeance upon
herself even at the risk of losing our lives. We would not have cared for other less eminent people. It
is, however, to be deeply regretted that owing to our misfortune she is not here and it is not likely
that she will ever come to this country. We, therefore, resolved to make an auspicious beginning by
first dealing with her stone image, and proceeded to make the necessary arrangements.
### WE SMEARED DAMAR TO THE QUEEN'S STATUE
We at first carefully examined the spot and thought over all the conveniences and
inconveniences, and considered in what way we should deal with the statue. Our first thought was
to break its head into small pieces by
999means of a large hammer with a long handle. But on mature consideration we thought it difficult to
do this in a short time and therefore resolved only to disfigure it. Considering that " He who does not
act up to his professions gets his face blackened " we resolved to inflict the same punishment on
her. Proceeding to make arrangements for the execution of our design, we decided to put round the
neck of the statue a string of precious gems in the form of shoes as a token of our devotion. But
whence were the gems to be brought ? We wanted small ones and began to look for them.
Moreover, it was necessary that the shoes should be old. The older they were, the better would they
suit our purpose. How were these conditions to be fulfilled ? As these could not be purchased with
money in the market, we searched many rubbish-heaps, but could not obtain any such gems there.
But as our devotion is genuine, God help us. While in Bombay, I used to go to a large house in
Kandewadi belonging to a gentleman by name Wagie, for the purpose of bathing, performing
sandhya and making prostrations (to the sun). While searching there for these gems I found them in
a basket lying in disorder under a staircase among other things. I stole them with great dexterity and
formed them into a necklace, in the middle of which we attached tassels of a very filthy substance. I
cannot mention that substance here. The shoes forming the necklace were of three or four sorts.
Having finished the necklace, we intended to execute our design on the (auspicious) day of Dasara
because on that day our ancestors used to set out for the purpose of overpowering their enemies. In
accordance with this our ancient custom we decided to make a beginning (on the said day). On
consulting astrological works we found two very auspicious periods, one occurring at dawn on the
Dasara day and the other at 2 p.m. on the second day after Dasara. As our object was to carry out
our design in the manner enjoined by the Shastras, we resolved to execute it on the day fixed (as
above). We bought six annas worth of dammar. It was very liquid. In order to make it into a very
hard plaster we mixed with it some gram-flour and the filthy substance above referred to. Having
thus prepared the mixture we kept it in a long tube of zinc and awaited the arrival of the appointed
auspicious hour. On the approach of the Dasara day we devoutly prayed to God to give us success
in our undertaking and resolved to get up at the earliest dawn. But as we awoke from sleep at a late
hour on that day, our whole plan failed. We, therefore, resolved not to fail (to execute our design) at
the second auspicious hour. That night we kept awake praying to God all the time. Soon after 8
O'clock at night, we took the tube containing dammer and the necklace of shoes to a certain spot
marked by us. Just before 2 O'clock we remembered Gajanan and started from our residence. At
that time there was bright moon-light. The Police were standing motionless at various places on the
road. I carried in my hand a stick long enough to reach my ears and was walking at a distance (from
my brother). My brother carried an iron pipe in his hand. We were walking at a distance from each
other. Instead of going by the metalled road, we passed through the open space adjoining the
Marine Battalion (Lines), and after reaching the baek part of the Police station near the Queen's
statue went a little further. We stopped for a while at a certain spot, and my brother went near the
statue and came back. We then decided that one of us should worship the statue and the other
should defend him (if necessary). Though any obstacle were to arise the worshipper was to finish
his task quietly, while the guard was to silently remove the obstacle by the use of the last expedient,
viz., violence. Accordingly, I undertook to act as a guard, while my brother undertook the worship
and both of us started. My brother crossed the railing on the right of the statue and entered the
compound, while, fully equipped, stood on the (left) side of the statue towards the Police station. At
that time the light in the lantern at the Police station was dimly burning. One or two peons were
indistinctly observed in the dark to be smoking cigarettes. From the spot
1000where I stood I could distinctly see the statue as well as perceive any movement on the part of the
men in the Police station. A little while before my brother climbed the statue a man went by the road
which passses the Police station. In our opinion this man was a Police Havaldar or Jamadar. I
thought that the man might happen to see what we were doing and that I might have to discharge
my duty. But nothing of the sort took place and the man went on without stopping. In the meantime
my brother had finished the worship (of the statue). When the necklace was thrown round the neck
(of the statue) it struck its chest and made a sound which, however, failed to draw the attention of
the (Police) sepoy. My brother got out of the compound by leaping over the railing and then I too
joined him on the road. By way of precaution we had previously seen some other roads by which we
might return home in case of necessity. But no such necessity having arisen, we returned home by
the high road. On our return home, we as usual, praised God by reciting hymns and then retired.
When next morning we went to see the statue, we saw many Hindus, Parsis, Muham-madans and
Europeans assembled there. All except the Europeans appeared to be delighted. The Police also
had gathered there. They removed the necklace from the statue and kept it at the Police station and
tried to remove the dammar by a powerful jet of water. Just then a prohibitory order was received
from the Police authorities for stopping the use of all remedies for the present. Seeing this we
returned home. At about 12 O'clock the news spread over the town, while at night it became the
subject of general talk. All began to admire the daring of the author of the deed. Many columns of
newspapers edited by Europeans were devoted to this topic. The (editors of) Marathi papers were
inwardly delighted, but outwardly they said that the bad character (who had perpetrated the deed)
ought to be arrested and punished. Speculation was rife. Some said that the deed was done not by
any Hindu or Muhammadan, but by a European. Others said that a Muham-madan had done it.
Every one said that such a daring deed could not have been done by a Hindu. We were highly
offended to hear such disagreeable words uttered by any one. With a view to make it generally
known that a Hindu had done the deed, we had already written a letter and placed it on the statue.
We were hitherto in doubt as to whether the Police had got it or not. I now learn that they did not get
it. It, therefore, seems that it was blown away by the wind. The Times (of India) gave a full
description of the occurrence, with the exception of the tassels attached to the necklace and the
letter. We, therefore, thought of writing a letter to that paper. As, however, we do not know English,
we had recourse to the following artifice : As the tenor of our letter made it desirable that it should
be posted at Thana, we addressed the following anonymous letter written in Marathi to the editor of
the Suryodaya, a newspaper published in that town :—
### THE DANDAPANI
" We have formed an association called Dandapani. Our fixed determination is to die
and kill (others) for the sake of our religion. The association was formed on the recent
auspicious day of Dasara. Its first achievement was the blackening of the face of (the statue
of) the Queen of England who made a distinction between Natives and Europeans. Having
done this the association informs the public as follows : This Dandapani Association will not
be overawed by any one. Any one who encourages immorality, whether the Queen or some
one superior to her, is the enemy of this association. This detailed statement will certainly
enable all to comprehend its object. It is for all our Aryan brethren to aid it directly or indirectly.
We, therefore, request you to take the trouble of forwarding an English version of this letter to
the Times (of India). You will thereby earn credit for having assisted the said association,
1001The purport of the letter was only that. That letter is with my friend Mr. Brewin, and I am of the
opinion that it should be published. We sent the above letter to the editor of the Suryodaya. Eut as it
was not published in the Times (of India) we concluded that the editor (of the Suryodaya) had not
forwarded it to the Times (of India). I, however,, now learn that he had forwarded it. In this manner
our first undertaking, viz., this affair of the Queen's statue, was successfully accomplished. The
people, however, continue to talk about the matter more or less till recently. In the course of that
talk, they gave utterance to some very amusing things, not even a hundredth part of which I can
mention here for fear of prolixity.
### OUTBREAK OF PLAGUE
At that time the bubonic plague was on the increase. All began to complain loudly of the
increasing oppression on the part of the Government. People began to leave Bombay for the
districts through fear (of the plague), while those in the mofussil ceased to go to Bombay owing to
the same cause.
### WE SET THE MANDAP ON FIRE
In the meantime the date of the Matriculation Examination was drawing near. As usual a fine
mandap was put up near Colaba for the said examination. As the plague was increasing every
moment, people from all parts (of the Presidency) petitioned the authorities concerned for a
postponement of the examination. The people of Poona made strenuous efforts in the matter. As,
however, the authorities were inexorable, we resolved to take up the matter into our hands, being
satisfied that we might settle it in a manner that would procure us popular applause. Besides, we
are dead against (higher) education, which has a bad effect on the boys. We are of opinion that the
loss of our physical strength is partly to be laid at the door of this Mlenchha learning. The entire
society has devoted itself to education and become too much thoughtful, and thereby has lost
manliness. At present (such is our condition that) if any one were to kick and cuff us soundly, we
shall only weary ourselves by holding meetings, making petitions and discussing the matter. Though
we have already lost so much by education, our educated men complain that Government does not
give us higher education. A vicious but poor man, in order to gratify his evil inclination, at first
spends his own money to seduce some rich man's son into an evil habit, but when the latter has
become a slave to the habit, withholds his own money and leads a life of pleasure and ease (at his
expense and) in his company so long as he has any money with him. In like manner when the
English assumed the administration of India, they thought it necessary to extinguish the spirit of the
Hindus by making them addicted to the vice of education. Thpy, therefore, spent their own money at
first. Seeing that the people have become pretty well addicted to it, they are now withholding their
own money. The more they do so, the more our people think that they are unwilling to give us
education, because it is the only means of securing our good. They, therefore, devote themselves to
education with still greater enthusiasm. But my brethren, you commit a mistake in thinking so. They
will not lose, but gain by giving you education. They wish to close the schools and colleges, not for
stopping education, but for reducing expenditure. They know that if they were to sever all
connection with education, the people being enthusiatically "attached to it will pay constant visits to
them at their bungalows and invite them to pan-supari in order to obtain permission to open schools
and colleges at their own expenses. This is actually the case at present. If they are (really) unwilling
to educate people, why are they so anxious to educate
1002women ? They always endeavour to educate the lower orders because they wish to make those
castes addicted to it which are now free from it and then to enjoy the fun. The Marathas, &c, have
lately begun to complain as follows : — " We do not receive education. Only the Brahmins become
educated. Even in former times they, with like selfishness, educated themselves, but kept us in
ignorance. We, therefore, pray that the paternal Government will be graciously pleased to give us
education." They repeatedly make such petitions (to Government). But they fail to understand that it
was by receiving education that the Brahmins destroyed their religious observances, caste, families,
morality and immorality, manliness and impotence. If in spite of the above results of that baleful
education the Marathas, &c, wish to acquire it, let them do so by all means and become effeminate.
Many people, on reading these our opinions which are quite opposed to education, will call us fools.
Poor things, let them do so. In a village inhabited by naked persons, a person wearing a dhotar is
sure to be called a downright fool. But he alone will be called wise by discerning persons. I can write
much on this topic, but refrain from doing so with a view to avoid prolixity. To be brief, as the
University was acting in opposition to (the wishes of) the people and was not also liked by us, we
thought of inflicting some damage on that body and accordingly began to make inquiries about the
mandap referred to above. We saw the mandap which was being put up near Colaba. Our intention
was to set fire to it only one day before the date of the examination, because in that case no new
mandap could be put up before the time of the examination, which, therefore, would be necessarily
postponed. But afterwards it occurred to us that if we did not find any opportunity on the previous
day, the examination would begin on the next day. We, therefore, thought that there was no
objection to setting fire to it one or two days before (the examination day). On examining the
mandap, we considered on what side it would be convenient to set it on fire, and proceeded to make
the necessary arrangements. Knowing that it would be difficult to go a long way in the latter part of
the night we resolved to do the business before 9 o'clock. The mandap was to be set on fire on the
side towards the railway compound. The materials and the method employed were similar to those
employed in setting fire to the upper story of the building belonging to Messrs. Phillips & Co.,
Bhudwar Peth, Poona, which had been occupied by a certain missionary. After setting fire to the
mandap we got out of the compound by leaping (over the fence), walked along the seashore as far
as the Churney Road Station and thence got home. After we had walked over a considerable
distance, we could see the glare of the fire. By the time we got home, the fire (had attained such
dimensions that it) could be easily seen from our chawl. But the people (in our chawl) did not know
that the mandap was on fire. All of them had assembled in the upper gallery to see the fire and
wondered where it had occurred. We also stood among them. They were in doubt (as to the origin
of the fire). Though we had no doubt whatever (on that point), we did not disclose the true facts to
them, but looked on with them in (feigned) astonishment. The next day the people knew for certain
that the. mandap had been burnt down. The educated people in particular were much delighted to
hear this. The police shifted their own responsibility by giving out that the fire had been caused by a
spark from the engine of a railway train. There was, however, a very general rumour among the
people that the fire had been caused by some Poonaite. A similar suspicion of the Poonaites had
been expressed in papers edited by Englishmen, in connection with, the blackening of the face of
the Queen's statute, though it cannot be known on what grounds they thought so. As, however, we
are very proud of Poona, once the capital of the Peshwas, we were delighted to hear the above
reports. The mandap being thus consumed by fire like an offering, the authorities were compelled to
postpone the examination, in consequence of which the people highly praised
1003the authors of the said deed. We were greatly delighted, to hear ourselves thus praised. A few days
after this we returned to Poona with our family. On our return we began to look out for some serious
enterprise, but could not soon find any. As, however, we had made it our vocation to persecute the
irreligious and glorify the religious, we could not feel easy at heart unless we did something towards
the accomplishment of our object. We were always absorbed in thinking what we should do and
how we should do it. The good or evil acts of the irreligious did not remain hidden from our keen
observation. Our wrath was specially direct-id against the Sudharak and Dnyan Chakshu
newspapers. We had obtained full information about the editors and proprietors of both these
newspapers. My readers must be aware of the fact that one of the editors of the Sudharak was
some time ago first lightly punished and then even a letter of warning was sent to him; but I am very
sorry to observe that he heeded our warning only in the first issue of the paper published after it was
given, but thereafter he reverted to his old practices and thus treated us with contempt. As we could
not put up with this, we resolved to cut off the head of this Devdhar (the said editor) and thus show
to the world what severe punishment is deserved by persons for the great sin (committed by them)
of vilifying their own religion. But on mature consideration it was resolved to kill an offending
European in the first place and then, after warning these brutes in human form to the effect that
those on whom they rely so much were dealt with by us in this manner, to ask them once more to
beware. Having resolved that, if even after such warning these men should fail to mend their ways,
they were to be mercilessly killed without delay. After this we ceased to give any further thought to
these educated blockheads.
### WE PUNISH THORAT
In the meantime, our dear friend, Bhuskute, reported (to us) that Mr. Thorat, a teacher in
Bhave's School, was a very bad man, being addicted to the vice of sodomy. This educated teacher
was in the habit of showing favour and giving higher rank to those boys only who were handsome
and young. We had already known Mr. Thorat to be a man of such character. We used to keep a
register of all ill-behaved men. There are in our register (the names of) many men who are very vile
and whose conduct is disgusting. All of them were to suffer at our hands one after another, but the
Almighty does not seem inclined to get this service done by us. God's will prevails. The educated
are invariably addicted to vice. This may probably be the effect of a liberal education. Let us
proceed. We had many a time sent anonymous letters to Mr. Bhave of the Bhave School
representing that the conduct of Thorat was such that it was not advisable to retain him in the school
as the boys might contract evil habits, and that it would be to his (Bhave's) interest to dismiss him
from the school; but no satisfactory arrangements were made. Later on, when we came to know of
many of his other vices, viz., eating flesh, drinking wine, vilifying the gods and the (Hindu) religion,
&c, Bhuskute was strongly of opinion that he should receive chastisement at our hands. It was
resolved to get this done by Bhuskute in order to inspire him with courage, and we made careful
inspection of the place where he resided. He used to live on the first floor of Mantri's Wada in a
room overlooking the street. When my brother and Bhuskute entered the room through a small
window over looking the road, they perceived that he was awake. He was sleeping in a cloth-
partitioned room. When, on hearing footsteps, he repeatedly asked in a low voice " Who is there ?
Who is there ? " my brother told (Bhuskute) to strike him and he struck him one blow ; but the blow
was feeble as Bhuskute was in a state of nervous excitement and he (Thorat) raised an alarm.
Thereupon,
1004my brother gave him a heavier blow and both then swiftly jumped out of the window and escaped.
The two pieces of iron piping (carried by them) in their hands remained on the floor while jumping
down, and were taken charge of by the Police. The next day this circumstance was much talked of
in the town, but our object was not accomplished. The people said that some thieves had come, but
not being able to steal anything went away. As he was, however, not a well-known man, no one said
anything about his vices. We did not derive any great satisfaction from this affair as our pride for
(our) religion did not come to light. After this, with the intention of doing something, we one night
took off the sign-board at the office of the Sudharak and placed it on Khasgiwale's privy which faced
the high road, and having filled an earthen jar with the ordure in that privy suspended it from the
door chain of the office of the Sudharak, and wrote on that jar the words " Remove our excrements."
Having done this during the night, we went in the morning to the spot (Sudharak's office) to see the
fun ; but as this state of things did not last for a long time, the people could not enjoy the fun to their
hearts content. The matter, however, was to some extent talked about in the city.
### WE BROKE AN EUROPEAN SHOW
Some days after this incident a Europeon brought down some kind of show to the new
Market. Its big apparatus had already arrived there two days before. On seeing the apparatus we
could not make out what wonderful show it was. But all our doubts were removed when he (the
European) set up the show by arranging its several parts. It is necessary to place before the reader
a description of this show. Friends, this show was not so very wonderful. It is, however, the
ignorance of our people which is unparalleled. In this India of ours, I have seen this show set up by
the poor people at their fairs and gatherings. A big pillar is set up on the ground and on the top of it
a canopy, to which (wooden) horses and camels are attached, is made to turn round. On payment
of one pice, a ride on these (wooden animals) is allowed. Generally, boys and country-people take a
ride on these wooden horses, but gentlemen never do so. In short, a show similar to that which we
consider to be so very vulgar was brought into the Market, the only difference being that it was of an
improved type. It consisted of two divisions ; the upper division was in a manner decorated and
couches were placed therein at intervals. The canopy was over decorated with tinsel. Some sort of
music was played while the canopy turned round. At night it glittered with lamps. The proprietor of
the show had fixed two rates of admission, namely, two annas for (a seat on) the lower division and
four annas for (a seat on) the upper one. While whirling round, this show afforded the same
pleasure as is derived from our country merry-go-rounds. But as it was brought there by a
European, our wiseacres flocked to see it like ghosts. The show for which our poor people charge
only one pice a head and thus earn their livelihood, is not patronized by our people professing
themselves to be refined. But as soon as they see that a European (has brought one), they forgetful
of their position, over and over again visit it like boys, paying four annas a head each time. I,
therefore, am at a loss to know how to characterise these wiseacres. Many reformers used to visit
the show with their wives. This class or reformers had stigmatised us by being born amongst us.
These fools have no idea of patriotism. We two brothers shall never admire, or derive any pleasure
from, any invention of the English, though it might show the highest inventive skill. Though many
admirable amusements !ike the phonograph have hitherto been introduced into India, our"
patriotism has never permitted us to see them even though people persuaded us to do so and were
prepared to pay for us. If we have at all seen any,
1005we have never in consequence of our patriotic feeling been inspired with admiration for them. We
have not starved for not having seen the extraordinary novelties introduced by foreigners, nor do the
unpatriotic reformers seem to have grown fat for having seen them. It is the foreigners who fill their
own cotters by plundering us and then bid good-bye to the country. We used to feel greatly
exasperated at these things, but what could we do ? How were we to expostulate with these idiots
(though they call themselves learned, I reckon them among perfect idiots) ? Thinking that the best
course would be to get rid of that apparently" seductive show, we resolved to set fire to it. We
accordingly procured phosphorus, and having made it into tablets, stuck pins into them to be handy
for use. We then arranged that Bhuskute and my brother, Bapurao, should go info the upper division
(of the show) and make use of (some of) them (to set fire to it), while I should use others in (setting
fire to) the private tent (of the proprietor) that was pitched on the ground, so that both the (merry-go
round and the) tent should be ablaze simultaneously. Accordingly, my brother went into the upper
division of the show, and when he was about to come down, I on my part, set fire below, and
immediately the tent on the ground was ablaze. Thereupon, all the spectators came down to
extinguish the fire. We were waiting to see the show also in a similar condition, but through some
inexplicable cause it did not catch fire. The fire-engine having come to the spot put down the fire.
The proprietor of the show suffered a good deal of loss. The next day the Police came there to keep
order, but we having showered stones upon them they could not do anything. On the third day, a
larger number of Police came to the assistance (of the showman). In spite of them, however, we
again attacked the show and some of the lamps and (wooden) horses and camels having been
broken on the occasion, the showman was subjected to considerable loss. At last that European got
disgusted and removed his show to a place near the (railway) station. We then let him alone. We did
not derive any great pleasure from this performance, but only felt that we had not wasted our hours
of leisure.
### PLAGUE IN POONA
In the meanwhile rumours about the increase of the bubonic plague in the city began to
spread, and people began to say that Government intended to make effective arrangements
regarding it. They also said that the arrangements (here) would be similar to those in Bombay. But
as we were not in the least satisfied with the preventive measures adopted in Bombay, we
determined to make an attempt to oppose the measures if the oppression practised in Bombay were
repeated here.
### WE SET OUR EYE ON RAND
While we were thus considering the matter, that very system was gradually put into operation,
and after a few days we heard that one Mr. Rand was appointed to give effect to it. On inquiry we
learnt that he was the same Mr. Rand who had sentenced (some) respectable gentlemen of Wai to
imprisonment. We, therefore, resolved not to trouble the other officers of the (Plague) Committee,
least they might get alarmed, but to punish the principal officer alone. We then made careful
inquiries (to find out) whether Mr. Rand was a good or a bad man. It was rumoured, in the city that
he was wicked man. His notorious (in) justice at Wai was the index of his perversity. We had,
however, a great desire to witness personally his iniquitous practices in our own city. As soon as we
heard of Mr. Rand's appointment, we three, viz., we two brothers and Bhuskute, began to look for
him. But he could not be 'seen anywhere. Some said he had not yet arrived, while others said he
had. Such
1006were the conflicting rumours that flew about in the city. Every day we went into the Cantonment, but
his bungalow could not be found. Many a time did we go to (office of the Plague) Committee. There
we saw Beveridge of Hongkong, Colonel Philips, Dr. Jones and other Europeans. We had mistaken
Colonel Philips for Mr. Rand, but one day that illusion was dispelled unmistakably. How to learn his
identity was then our sole anxiety. We could not openly question anybody on the point for fear of
exciting suspicion. Thus we spent several days in simply trying to have a look at Mr. Rand. But he
had not arrived till then. The rumours that he had come and taken over charge of his duties were
groundless. We think that he took charge of his duties long after (this time). We had a full view of
this individual on the day the inspection commenced ; but still we took care to ascertain his identity
from many persons. We then saw his carriage, and, on inquiry of the coachman through Bhuskute
as to where Mr. Kand had put up, we learnt that he was staying at the Club. We then paid frequent
visits to the Club premises, but could get no inkling of his where abouts. We all three then ceased to
visit the Cantonment and took to visiting the Municipal (office) where we could see him in the
mornings as well as in the evenings. Ever since the commencement of the house-to-house
visitation, he used to come to Bhudhwar (Peth) every morning and thence proceed to the places
where the inspection was to take place. Many people used to collect together in Budhwar (Peth) in
order to see him when he came there. On the first day, the work of inspection began in Budhwar
and the sight was an unprecedented one. The people being unused to such inspections were off
their guard.
### THE ATROCITIES OF THE PLAGUE OFFICERS
Had they known that this inspection meant only spoliation ; that the white men carrying on
that work were marauders with Colonel Phillips, Lewis and other white men as their ringleaders ;
that Mr. Rand was the chief in command over them ; that it was merely for the sake of carrying on
this premediatated and extensive loot that one Dr. Jones was appointed before hand ; that as a
preliminary step these English marauders had caused him to make large openings in the houses of
the rich as well as of the poor with the only object of rendering visible, while on their raid in broad
daylight, the treasury boxes and other articles placed in the dark ; that like the Ramoshi dacoits of
our own country, who first make careful inquiries (about the belongings of their victims) to unable
them to commit dacoities during night, Dr. Jones had, at the outset, by means of a general inquiry
prepared a list of the rich as well as the poor people of the city and had handed it over to those
marauders at the commencement (of the operations) ; and that those marauders taking advantage
of the mildness of the Hindus, were about to commence their pillage under the guise of law ; (in
short), if the rayats had known before hand that their paternal Government was about to cut the
throats of their own subjects in the above manner, they would have, to save themselves, migrated to
some other place with all their belongings. But as they failed to perceive this state of things before
hand they remained in their homes (confident of their) security. Meanwhile a band of these
marauders paid their first visit to Budhwar (peth). Immediately on their arrival, they stationed guards
at the corner of the street and began to break open shops by picking the locks. Oh ! what a
spectacle it was. Indeed, neither history nor tradition can show such treatment accorded to a subject
people by their rulers. One can understand an army raised to meet an enemy being used in
repelling an invading foe ; but here we see our valiant Englishmen (utilising) their brave and well
equipped forces in swooping down upon moribund victims ( of the plague and packing them off to
hospitals. How very brave of them. Would (any other) ruler on the face of the globe use his forces in
such a fashion ? Our English (rulers), however, appear to think that valour consists not in striking
1007down a man in full possession of his powers, which any one can, do, but in capturing those who are
stricken with illness and are unable to move an inch. It is lor this reason tnat they employed their
well-drilled soldiers on such operations. In this way did these plunderers commence their
depredations. We always followed (the parties which carried on) this plunder, with the object of
seeing with our own eyes their high-handed proceedings. I prefer to call these operations a loot
rather than inspection. While this loot was going on, high officers of Government with Mr. Rand at
their head paraded in the streets and supervised the breaking of kicks, the making away with
furniture and (other) lawless proceedings and also saw that all these operations were duly carried
on. They were at this time (so much) blinded (with authority) that they cared not for any Hindu
gentleman (however high his position might be). Nothing but burning, demolition, wreckage and
arrests were to be seen in those parts which this band of raiders visited. I do not think that those
who have seen such slights would characterise these vilest men otherwise than as marauders.
Rules were framed for regulating the manner in which this pillage was to be carried on. The rules
which were reduced to writing were in themselves mild in a large measure, but the manner in which
they were carried out appeared to be quite the reverse. It was expressly laid down in the rules that
no one should so act as to wound the religious susceptibilities of any one. But these white men
purposely acted in such a way as to exasperate us, and Mr. Rand witnessed this spectacle with
great satisfaction.
### WE RESOLVE TO KILL RAND
I am unable to describe how exasperated we felt on such occasions. We resolved to take his
(Mr. Rand's) life at all risks. Having formed this resolve we set to work. We possessed swords only.
We had two pistols but had no gunpowder and hence they were useless. A pistol was, of course,
the most convenient weapon for a swift action, but what was to be done ? Whence was the
ammunition to be procured ? We, therefore, resolved to perpetrate the deed with swords alone. We
selected two of the best we possessed and attached to them straps of tape to sling them from our
shoulders. The sheaths which were of black (leather) were wrapped in pieces of white turban and
thus made to appear white. Having made these preparations, we began to look out for a suitable
spot (to execute our design), but did not succeed in fixing upon any. We, therefore, determined to
perpetrate the deed near the (Municipal) Committee's office, the only restriction being that it was to
be executed not earlier than 8 o'clock in the evening. The idlers in the city had, however, put Mr.
Rand on his guard by sending intimidatory anonymous letters to him. This put us to a great deal of
trouble. He would not remain in the city after nightfall, and began to take with him an escort of
sowars on his way (to the Municipal office) and back. We, however, did not allow ourselves to be
discouraged in the least. We resolved to kill both (Mr. Rand and the sowars). But we could not move
out with swords except at night-time, while he (Mr. Rand) would not allow nightfall to overtake him
(in the city). Several days elapsed in this manner. Opperession as well as the plague increased in
the city (and) it was wholly abandoned by its inhabitants. Our father received invitations from distant
places to go there as the plague was raging (in Poona) and he made preparations to go to a distant
place, and, therefore, began to put impediments in the way of his going. When, however, we saw
that he very much wished to leave Poona, we decided that it would be more convenient (for us) to
go to our house at Chinchwad than to any distant place. Chinchwad being (only) ten miles distant
from Poona, we thought that, in case we went to that place, we could come here any day and
execute our design. Accordingly,
1008we proposed to go to Chinchwad, and our father, having approved of the proposal, wrote about it to
our uncle at the place ; but the latter raised many objections (to our proposal) and wrote back to say
that it was not advisable for us to remove there. Thus did he manifest his brotherly feeling. As we
could not secure any other place in the vicinity of Poona, we made a request to our vyahi, Mr.
Paranjpe, in the matter and obtained his permission to remove to his garden at Kirkee. We found
this place more convenient than Chinchwad and shifted there on an auspicious (day).
We took great care not to allow any one even to suspect that we three were bent upon the
perpetration of a terrible deed. While at Kirkee, we formed the acquaintance of one R. Jones, a
missionary, living in the Kirkee bazar. We asked for and obtained 25 to 30 percussion caps from
him, but gunpowder could not be obtained anywhere. Being, however, informed by Bhuskute that
we would be able to procure gunpowder at the house of Kachare, a mali in a garden at Kothrud, we
three proceeded thither one night as if for pleasure and made away with some gunpowder and small
shot. (In the meanwhile) Mr. Rand had carried his oppression to the highest pitch. The people talked
about (the advisability of) taking his life and lamented that there was no religious enthusiast
amongst them who could do that work. The people of other places scoffed at the Poonaites, and the
newspapers wrote in derision about the city, calling it garrulous and nothing more. Every day saw
new modes of oppression. Temples were desecrated in one part of the city, in another women were
outraged and idols broken. The poor and the helpless were the greatest sufferers at the hands of
these marauders. While this state of things was going on, we every day came to Poona from Kirkee
and returned home in the evening. Our father did not like to see us go to and return from Poona in
the noon-day sun. He pointed out to us in various ways that the course we were following would be
deleterious to our health, but as we were bent upon the execution of our object we persisted in
paying stealthy visits to Poona. When our father came to know of this, he got angry with us and
moved back to Poona, and we too with all the members of our family followed suit. The bubonic
plague was raging in the city at this time, but we had the consolation that it would now be easy for
us to make an attempt to carry out our plan.
### BHUSKUTE FALLS PREY TO THE PLAGUE
In the meanwhile, our dear friend, Dattatraya Bhuskute, was seized with this deadly fever. On
the day he fell ill, he came and told us about it. He, however, said that as the fever was of an
ordinary type we need not entertain any fears on that score. After this he went home and we never
saw him again. As no member of his family knew that we were his friends, we could not call at his
house to inquire after his health. I, however, sent my youngest brother on this mission, but
everybody being apprehensive of these marauders, none would admit that Bhuskute was ill. Great
God. Where (art) thou. To what depths of dependence have we Hindus sunk. As we could not hear
any news about Bhuskute's health, we resolved that he should, while yet on his sick-bed, hear that
the wretch (Mr. Rand) had been punished. With this object in view we strained every nerve for the
execution of our design, but instead of a favourable opportunity offering itself for the perpetration of
the deed the evil news that Bhuskute had departed this life fell on our ears. Our grief knew no
bounds when we received this news. It is easy to imagine how difficult it is to find a bosom friend
who will co-operate with one in such work as we had undertaken. Unfortunately for us, our friend
was not spared to us. We went outside the city, and stretching out our hands towards heaven
uttered the following words with upturned faces : — " Friend, you have strenuously exerted yourself
along with us in the interest of our
1009religion. May God grant you eternal happiness. That wretch will shortly be despatched to the world
of Pluto. You need not entertain any anxiety on that score. That is the only way by which we can
fulfil your desires." Having addressed these words to (the spirit of) Bhuskute, we retraced our way to
the town, meditating on the transitoriness of our material existence. The fate of our friend filled us
with utter despondence as regards this world, and thinking that God might one day snatch us away
in a similar manner we made up our mind that, come what might, we must execute our design even
in broad daylight if we could not find a suitable opportunity at night. So the death of our friend,
instead of disheartening us, spurred us on to set about our undertaking with greater vigour. As far
as possible we were resolved not to run any personal risk in our attempt, but if that was not found
possible, we were determined to carry out our plan even at the sacrifice of our lives. Whenever a
gang of the marauders visited our Peth, they found us fully prepared (to meet them). We were
determined fo make the European (soldiers) pay with their lives in case they misconducted
themselves in our house. At the same time we thought the killing of those worthless soldiers too
trivial an affair, and therefore with a view not to allow Mr. Rand to escape unscathed, one of us kept
an eye on the spot where he took his stand. Our object was that the moment the soldiers
misconducted themselves in our house I was to strike them down, while my brother was to deal
similarly with Mr. Rand. We were prepared every day to act in this manner. Fortunately, however,
the soldiers did not act against our wishes in our house. Once it so happened that my brother was
rather indisposed at the time these marauders visited our house, but even on that occasion we took
care to be ready with our arms to impress upon the minds of the marauders that we at all events
were men of self-respect in the town. In our house we used to take these marauders only into my
brother's room and to the storey of our house occupied by our father, but did not allow the brutes to
trespass into the god-house, nor into the kitchen, nor into the women's apartments. Our she-buffalo,
which was tethered in the back yard of our house, used to fiercely rush at the European (soldiers)
whenever it saw them. They, therefore, being terrified at its fierce look, did not venture into that part
of the house. We are very proud of the fact that even our she-buffalo was such a fierce animal. As
we used to be in such a state of preparedness, God took care of us. The Europeans acted in
accordance with our wishes in our house. One day, however, a European insisted upon entering our
house, but when we both of us told him in an indignant tone that it was impossible for him to do so,
he being inspired by God in some unknown manner quietly went away. Though I personally
witnessed outrages committed at other places, nothing calculated to provoke us occurred in our own
house and consequently we were calmly maturing our plans concerning Mr. Rand. Many a trivial
quarrel took place between the soldiers and ourselves on the road, but all this originated in our own
tricks.
### OUR PREPARATIONS FOR REVENGE
The epidemic of fever and tyranny having increased in the above manner, now began to
abate by the will of God. After some days house-to-house visitation was discontinued, but the police
stations established at the cemeteries were retained. Each of these stations had two armed sentries
and we became fired with a desire to make away with their guns. With that object in view we
examined all the stations and found The one located on Lakdipul to be the most convenient one (for
our purposes). I then went there four or five times disguised as a pujari, and on one occasion having
made my prostrations to Balbhima, snatched away with his permission two Henri-Martinis and one
sword and took them to our house. This was a source of extreme delight to us both. I cannot
describe how joyful we felt. We now
1010felt confident enough to face even an army. Our ill-luck, however, did not show us that day, nor is
there any prospect of our ever seeing it hereafter. We had procured the guns but where were
cartridges to be found ? It was our intention to attempt to procure them later on. On the following
day the news of the theft of the guns spread in the city, and in very flattering terms did the people
speak of the discipline and bravery of the soldiers concerned. The people (however) were wonder-
struck at the (boldness of the) person who had stolen the guns. This circumstance delighted us the
most. But as there was no possibility of the guns being of any use to us in our undertaking in the
absence of cartridges, we stowed them away with great care. Since the house-to-house visitation
system was discontinued, Mr. Rand was not very punctual in coming to and going from the city. He
came and went at any time he liked. Consequently, our intention of accomplishing our design in the
city fell through. Then we began visiting the Club in the Cantonment in order to find out his room.
Having found it out, we went to the Cantonment every evening and watched the movements of Mr.
Rand. Every Wednesday and Sunday he was in the habit of going to St. Mary's Church for evening
service. Five or seven times did we lie in wait for him at this place, but could not succeed in our
object. While there,.we once happened to enter into conversation with a European constable. We
also went to the Club three or four times in different disguises. Then we visited the Gymkhana eight
or ten times, and in the course of our visits to that place we came into collision with a European
constable. It would be wearisome if I entered into full details about the various attempts made by us
as stated above. I would, therefore, content myself by giving here only a resume of what we did and
then conclude. The adage " God helps those who help themselves" is not untrue. We were
unremitting in our efforts, but the time of our departure for Bombay having approached, we were
filled with anxiety as to how God would enable us to commit the deed. We prayed to God repeatedly
to make us His instruments in committing the deed, and thus enable us to do some service to our
religion. Whenever we heard the utterances of the people about the oppression which they were
suffering, we imagined that they were layihg their grievances before us just as people seek redress
from a king. We thought that we owed these people a debt which would remain undischarged if the
deed were not perpetrated, and then we would be ashamed to show our face to the public. We,
therefore, often prayed to Shri Gajanan to save us from such disgrace. As time passed on, the
Jubilee day approached. The newspapers began to be filled with descriptions of the manner in
which this grand festival was to be celebrated, and we believed that Europeans of all ranks would
go to the Government House at Ganesh Khind on that occasion. Thinking, therefore, that would be
a fitting time for us, both of us started to reconnoitre that part of the country and inspected all the
large and small roads in the vicinity thereof. After examining all the places, we resolved to cross the
Lakdi Bridge and the canal flowing past the yellow bungalow situated on this side of the spot where
the pandal of the National Congress was erected and then to debouch on the high road leading to
Ganesh Khind at a point where it passes the yellow bungalow and there execute our commendable
deed and then return. We had (also) fixed upon certain unoccupied bungalows in the
neighbourhood for the purpose of taking shelter therein in case it should rain at the time. While
crossing the canal in the course of our inspection of the places, we needlessly remonstrated with
certain European girls who were paddling In the water near the yellow bungalow and then
proceeded to do our homage to the goddess Chatursingi, the mother of the universe. There we
prayed to her by reciting the following song :—
Pad.
On mother of the universe, we are about to perform a commendable deed; vouchsafe
success to us.
1011Confer on us, Oh mother Bhavani, the blessing of subduing the enemy; Oh mother, etc.
We have no other supporter in (this) world except thyself. Rand has completely
destroyed the (Hindu) religion in the holy city (Poona).
(That) wretch has ruined all.
Oh mother give us firmness and daring in killing that inconsiderate man with our own
hands ; Oh mother of the universe.
Having invoked her in this way we came back. On our return home we began our devotions to the
Almighty. The Lord of the universe alone knows how devoutly we prayed to Gajanan, offering him
our bodies, our minds and our belongings. We believe that Gajanan answered our prayer. Our first
consideration was what weapons we should take with us, (and) we resolved that each of us should
arm himself with a sword and a pistol. My brother Bapurao, determined to take with him a hatchet in
addition. He intended to use these arms according to the exigencies of the occasion. My leaders will
remember that we had already kept the sword ready (for use). The pistol which I had chosen to take
with me was out of order. Only one of its chambers could be used. That of Bapurao had a single
barrel, but it was of large bore. Having determined to arm ourselves with these weapons, we waited
for the occasion. We spent the whole day in offering prayers to the Almighty. As we were quite
uncertain as to the success or failure of this undertaking, we were altogether unmindful of our
domestic concerns. But one thing remains to be described. Government wished that the Jubilee
festival should be celebrated by the rayats. Accordingly, in the city (Poona), nay, in the whole of
India, that festival was most loyally observed even by Princes, and Chiefs. Viewed in a proper light
this was not a time for rejoicing.
### THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE
There was plague in the Bombay Presidency, earthquakes on the Calcutta side and a terrible
famine all over India. How (un) generous it was (for the Queen of England) to cause the rayats,
already beset with three such formidable calamities, to celebrate the sixtieth year of her reign at
such a critical juncture instead of relieving them from those calamities. This behoves only the Queen
of England. According to our Shastras, a. king and his subjects are in the same relationship as a
father and son. On this principle, the Queen is the mother of her subjects. But judging from her
actions there is no reason why, instead of being styled a subject-protecting mother, she should not
be called a female fiend who devours her own progeny. Had the Queen a generous heart, she
would have on the said joyful occasion earned the blessings of her subjects by feeding them. But as
we saw nothing of that sort, we did not like the festival at all and thought that it was the duty of every
true Aryan to show his indifference rather than to take part in rejoicings. We do not at all like to
make a false display of loyalty by means of hypocritical newspaper articles or speeches. India is, at
this moment, full of such imbeciles. Though these good-for-nothing people do not at all like the
policy of the British Government, they make a great show of their loyalty in their newspapers and
speeches. Some shower upon the Queen covert ridicule in a variety of ways, but when charged
under section 124 defend their writings by asserting that they did not mean what is alleged of them.
Thinking that it was a thousand times better to openly spurn the English people, their authority and
their Queen, and to bring them into disgrace, we exerted ourselves in that direction. Our people
being conscious of the truth of the
1012adage " Wisdom prevails not against authority " were celebratiag the Jubilee Festival in a half-
hearted manner, though they were unwilling to take part in the rejoicings. We however, do not
consider curselves to be her loyal subjects, and therefore, with a view to mar the rejoicings, instead
of joining in them we resolved to set up an image of the Queen of England at some conspicuous
and central spot in the Budhawar street on the morning of the Jubilee day. We laboriously searched
many rubbish heaps and procured with great difficulty some extremely old and tattered shoes. We
could get only six of them and no more. We set up these shoes on the main Budhawar road, with a
picture of the Queen stuck to the sole of each of them. With regard to this, our educated brethren
would taunt us by saying that we did this stealthily and not openly, yes, friends, yes ; though we did
it stealthily at that time, we knew full well that :some day we would have to come forward and that
we would do so with great pride. That blessed day has now fortunately dawned upon me, for which I
thank Gajanan. Having done this in the morning we prepared ourselves to go to the Ganesh Khind
as soon as it was dusk. At the time of our departure we relinquished all hopes of our home, wives,
children, parents, friends and relatives. When leaving our house, we devoutly made obeisance to
Shri Mangalmurti, and muttering his name made a mental obeisance to our parents and bid adieu in
our minds to all, young and old, nay, we even touched our extremely favourite she-buffalo and took
leave of them all. Similarly, with the words " Dear brethren. May the merits of you all help us in the
attainment of success." we left the house. We even took with us our sacred scripture, the Gita.
### WE DO IT
It was about 7 or 7-30 o'clock and the sun had just set. Darkness was increasing every
moment. After we had gone out of the city, we recited the above-mentioned verses in praise of the
Chatursingi Bhavani. and taking the appointed route soon reached Ganesh Khind. As soon as we
arrived there we saw Mr. Rand's carriage pass by, but not being quite sure that it was his, we
postponed the execution of the deed till the time of his return (from the Government House). A large
concourse of people had gathered there to witness the spectacle, but there were very few Brahmins
among them. Owing to the bonfires on the hill tops and the crowd of spectators, it became difficult
for us to walk about with our swords. Wo, therefore, deposited the two swords and one hatchet
under the stone culvert situated in the vicinity of the bungalow in such a way as to easily reach them
in case of need. This enabled us to move about with the greatest ease. For fear of coming across
any acquaintance, we, instead of walking about on the public road, betook ourselves to a field in the
dark and there leisurely devoted ourselves to divine contemplation. When (I saw that) no more
carriages were coming from the city and those which had already gone there (Government House)
had begun to return, I proceeded to the gate and took my stand near it. It was arranged between
ourselves that I was to run after the carriage (of Mr. Rand) and my brother was to come to my
assistance near the yellow bungalow in the execution of the deed, and that While running after the
carriage I was to call out " Gondya " as a signal to him, so that he might understand that the
carriage was coming and prepare himself for action. Having made this arrangement I approached
the gate. The carriage in question came up after many others had preceded it, and having fully
identified it I gave it chase, running at a distance of some 10 or 15 paces behind. As the carriage
neared the yellow bungalow. I made up the distance (between it and myself) and called our "
Gondya". My brother came up to me directly. I undid the button of the flap of the
1013carriage, raised it. and fired from a distance oE about a span. Our original plan was to empty both
the pistols at Mr. Hand so as to leave no room for doubt about his death. But as my brother lagged
behind, the charge from my pistol (alone) hit Mr. Rand and his carriage rolled onwards. My brother,
suspecting that the occupants of trie carriage behind were, on seeing us, whispering to each other,
aimed his pistol at the head of (one of them) from behind the carriage and fired a bullet.
### WE ESCAPE UNNOTICED
We then went away with speed by the pre-arranged route. We intended to take away the
swords on the following day. On our return home we offered fervent prayers to the Almighty. We
could not sleep that night owing to excess of delight. Having bathed early in the morning we went
out and passed the Faraskhana and the Municipal Office to see if there was any excitement in the
city over the matter. But people appeared to know nothing about the incident. The news began to
spread in the city at about 10 or 11 a.m. By evening the incident was everywhere talked about and
every one was overjoyed. All Hindus and Muhammadans, whether rich or poor, young or old,
reformers or non-reformers, shared equally this feeling of extreme delight, and every one distributed
according to his means either sugar-candy or sweetmeats. I leave it to my readers to imagine what
gratification we must have felt when the universal feeling of joy was so great. We were delighted
because the people were delighted ; otherwise, we had no ill-feeling against Mr. Rand.
Had he been careful not to interfere with our religion, that is to say, had he taken notice of the
lawless conduct of the soldiery, we would not have been compelled to perpetrate the deed we had
been following Mr. Rand's movements for nearly three months and a half, and during that period we
came to entertain a very good opinion of him. He was a proud man like ourselves and we believe
that he was not addicted to any vice There was no meanness in his character. We had seen him
playing lawn.-tennis at the Gymkhana. He would never play with ladies, and from this (we inferred)
that he disliked associating with the wives of others. We had marked this and many other traits in
his character. But of what avail was all this ? As he made himself an enemy of our religion, we
deemed it necessary to take revenge upon him. We could not help it. This incident threw the Police
into a great commotion, and innumerable were the rumours that circulated in the city. Some said
that they were going to search all the houses for weapons. As we had to remove to Bombay, we
thought it undesirable to leave our weapons behind. We, therefore, tried them up in a bundle and
threw them in a well appertaining to the house of Londhe. Having learnt that the swords which we
had left underneath the culvert had been taken away by the Police to the Faraskhana, we did not go
there. But we went to pay a visit to Jagadamba and having filled the lap of that deity with a khan and
a cocoanut returned home. The next day we left for Bombay with all the members of our family by
the 1-30 p.m. train. On our way to the railway station some members of the Bombay Police Force
passed by us in a carriage, and we at once recognized them. We desired to be in Poona at this
time, but it was just as well that our wish was not fulfilled, for had we remained there we might have
been tempted to do something. We were thus a prey to alternate feelings of relief and sorrow. In this
state we arrived in Bombay. The troubles which the English as well as the natives had to undergo in
consequence of this act of ours (if narrated) would fill a big volume. I do not, therefore, think it
desirable to narrate them.
1014WE WRITE ANOTHER LETTER
As they (the English) suspected that the Brahmins alone were responsible for this affair, we
hit upon a device to transfer their suspicion to the Muhammadans by sending a letter (to the
newspapers ?) purporting to be signed by a Ghazi. We thought it would be a good thing if the letter
were written in Hindustani, but as there was no one amongst us who knew the language, we
decided to send it in English, and just as we had made the editor of the Suryodaya to publish a letter
in connection with a previous incident, viz., the tarring of the Queen's statue, so we wrote to the
editor of the Mumbai Vaibhav asking him to send (to the newspaper) a letter in English signed ' A
Ghazi' who should take upon himself the responsibility for the deed.
### THE LETTERS GIVE A CLUE
A copy of that letter must be in the possession of the Police, and I am of opinion that it should
be published along with this. We sent that letter, but did not gain anything by doing so. On the
contrary, we were placed at a disadvantage. That letter only led Mr. Brewin to hit upon the idea that
the man connected with the tarring of the Queen's statue and the assault on Mr. Velankar must be
the author of the present deed also. With this clue he began his investigations. We came to know of
this, but we could not rectify our mistake. The assault on Mr. Velankar had placed us in a very
unfavourable situation as he could have identified us. This was a very good clue for the Police, and
every one whom they suspected was taken by tnem to Mr. Velankar for identification.
### MY PROUD CONFESSION
We passed three months in Bombay vigilantly, when all of a sudden I, one day, received a
call from the Police. It was in connection with Gopalrao Sathe. I obeyed the summons, and they (the
Police) took me to Poona and placed me before Mr. Brewin. There in the presence of
Superintendents Kennedy and Brewin I, in the interest of the public, made, on certain conditions, a
confession of murder and proudly detailed the particulars connected therewith, with a view to earn
renown. To convince them. 1 of my own accord gave them many a minute detail. Nay, I adduced
evidence in support of my statements. The fact that (I was connected with) the tarring of the
Queen's statue and that the shoes made use of in the affair belonged to Wagle was proved by me
to their satisfaction. As for Velankar, I got my statement corroborated in his presence. I made a
confession in Bombay before Mr. Hamilton and I signed it. I had at first informed the Police that I
had done this deed single-handed, but I had subsequently to retract that statement owing to a
turban and a piece of tape having been found in the bundle of weapons. As the Police had come to
the conclusion that the (murders) must have been committed by two men, I mentioned the name of
my brother and thus made him a participator in the glory. It was I alone who supplied the Police with
all the evidence in the case. I have entirely forgotten my long cherished hatred of the English owing
to the intercourse I subsequently had with Superintendents Kennedy and Brewin. These gentlemen
have, till now, shown themselves to be true to their word in their treatment of me, and I pray to God
that they might continue to do so until the end. The next part (of this autobiography) will contain a
narration in detail of what has taken place since my removal by the Police from Bombay to Pooha. I
now conclude the accounts of Rand's assassination.

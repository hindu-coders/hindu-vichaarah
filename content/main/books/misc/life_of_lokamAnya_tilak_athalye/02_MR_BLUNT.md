The highest praise that has yet been accorded to 
Lokamanya Tilak has come, curiously enough, from the 
Hon. Mr. Gokhale who is reported to have said to an 
Enghsh friend that, bom a hundred and twenty years 
before, Mr. Tilak would have carved out a kingdom for 
himself. This pithiest and most appropriate compli- 
ment pictures for us Mr. Tilak as he really was, not a 
product of the Western Civilisation and of the English 
Government but a solitary surviver of the race which 
four generations back had well-nigh conquered the whole 
of India. It was impossible for him to be assimilated, 
like most of his countrjTnen by and in the mighty 
Enghsh Government ; nor could that Government crush 
his spirit and make him a helpless spectator of our 

downfall. He was every inch a soldier a soldier 

in a civilians' garb. The Press and the Plaftorm were 
his field of action; and from this battlefield he waged 



2 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

a relentless war on the Indian Bureaucracy for nearly 
forty years. He alone of all others dared strike the 
shield of the Government with the " sharp end of the 
steel." The silent suffering country wanted a man 
who could speak out without mincing matters, one who 
could boldly stand up for cur birth-right held in pawn 
by the rulers of the land. Where could such an one be 
found except in the great Mahratta race ? 

Bal Gangadar Tilak was born at Ratnagiri on July 
23rd, 1856. Bom in a race to which the Peshwas be- 
longed and in a town not far away from the birth-place 
of Balaji Vishwanath, he WcLS, indeed, destined to play 
the role of a representative of those who had ruled the 
greater part of India for nearly a hundred years. In 
the year of his birth the political atmosphere in India 
was electric. It was a remarkable year for this re- 
markable child to be ushered into existence. It was as 
ominous to the new nilers of the land as this child was 
destined to be. Lord Dalhousie, the last of the aggres- 
sive proconsuls of the British East India Company had 
just departed, cutting off all the Native poppies that 
dared appear tall among the degenarates of the van- 
quished races of India, and while he was thus stretching 
the red canvas over the country, the last vestiges of the 
Imperial families of Delhi and of Satara were 
swept away, witfi the result that he left a legacy as 
fatal to his successor as Lord Chelmsford has done 
to the present Viceroy. Hindus and Mahomedans 
smarting under the humiliation of eclipsed crescent 
and BJiagva Zenda had made common cause. 
The unity was no doubt temporary, the result of a 
common wrong ; the essential condition for a successful

revolution was wanting, the proletariat being unwilling 
to be disturbed by the wails and woes of the feudal 
landlords with their figure-head Royalties. So the 
rising ended in smoke, making the Enghsh still more 
secure in the land. 

Thus it was that when Bal, the only son and second 
child of Gangadharpant {alias Nana) Tilak was passing 
the early days of his life in his home at Ratnagiri, re- 
markable deeds of grim valour and cruel carnage were 
an every-day occurance in distant Delhi. The red 
fury of inflamed soldiery that had set the whole country 
ablaze must have borne its flues and sparks to the 
birth-place of our hero, at least in the form of a wonder- 
ful crop of rumours. It is inconceivable that the green 
memory of these things should have failed to impress 
the imagination of a child whose whole life was a dedi- 
cation to the service of the Motherland. 

What httle is known of Bal's mother shows that she 
was a kind-hearted and an intensely religious woman. 
His father was one of those gems " of purest ray serene" 
that for want of favourable opportunities lie concealed 
in the deep " caverns of the ocean." Bom in August 
1820, he had passed the early years of his boyhood in 
dreaming dreams of learning and high social position 
and had, after finishing his vernacular course of instruc- 
tion at Dabhol (Dist. Ratnagiri), walked over, in those 
days of difficult travelling to Poona. At a time when 
a boy learning English had every kind of encouragement 
given to him. Nana would surely have been able to cc«n- 
plete his studies ; but a domestic misfortune compelled 
him to bid good-bye to all his ambitions and rest con- 
tent, as a school master, with the " splendid " salary of 



4 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Rs. 10 per mensem. But though he was thus called 
upon to waste his abilities in the cramping atmos- 
phere of vernacular school-life, he never neglected his 
duties nor did he abandon his favourite pursuit of 
knowledge. All his leisure was devoted to the 
study of Mathematics, Sanskrit and Marathi ; and 
his mastery over the several branches of these sub- 
jects enabled him to bring out two books, the 
one on Trigonometry and the other on Marathi 
Grammar. But neither the scholarship of Gangadharpant 
nor his conscientious discharge of duties could make 
his superiors forget or overlook his stern sense of 
personal independence. The inevitable consequence 
followed : he was neglected in official preferment. 
It was only after full 17 years of service, when 
his claims could not with decency be set aside, that he 
was rewarded with the much-coveted post of an Assist- 
ant Deputy Educational Inspector and was transferred 
to Poona (1866). 

The intensely religious vein of the mother and the 
stem sense of personal independence of the father re- 
flected themselves in the wilful nature of the boy, a 
characteristic which has played no insignificant part in 
his future career. This delicate child of a delicate 
mother was not put to school before he was 11, not cer- 
tainly for want of facilities — Ratnagiri was a District 
town — but evidently because, the father, himself a 
school-master, intended to give his son a good ground- 
ing in Sanskrit and vernacular in the unfettered free- 
dom of home-life. Bal proved wonderfully responsive 
to his father's instructions. He loved his childish plays 
no doubt, but, evea at that age the ponderous volumes 



MR. BLUKT 5 

in his father's library impressed him more. One 
book particularly attracted his fancy. He had heard 
his father reading the sonorous periods of Bana's 
Kadamhari and believing the book to be no more diffi- 
cult than the holy Sanskrit verses he was set to recite 
every evening, he went up to his father and asked for 
the loan of the book. Startled with the request, but un- 
willing to dispirit his son by a curt refusal Gangadhar- 
pant promised to give the book on one condition. A 
knotty problem in Arithmetic was set ; Bal was to 
work it out and have the book. Armed with slate and 
pencil, Bal waged a relentless war on the problem for 
an hour and a half and carried off the prize amidst the 
applause of the proud mother and the loving sister. 

This was the first triumph of Bal's life. His poor 
mother did not live to see others. Her health, natural- 
ly delicate, undermined by frequent fasting gave way 
and she died (1866) before realising an Indian mother's 
ambition of getting her son married. Sometime later, 
Bal was sent to school. He jumped from standard to 
standard and was soon transferred to the Poona High 
School whence he matriculated in 1872. The rigid for- 
mality of the classes, with its accompaniment of church- 
yard silence utterly disgusted him. The spectacle of 
mediocre teachers hammering scrappy stuff, styled 
knowledge into the mediocre brains of students was not 
calculated to charm a boy to whom reading was under- 
standing and committing to memory no labour. The 
race of marks and of rank could never allure him; 
His unwillingness to take down notes and translations 
was an enigma to his teachers. He was content that he 
had learnt the lessons and was quite indifferent to the 



h LOKAMANYA TILAK 



u 



expression. He cared more for knowledge than for 
words, more for thoughts than for the expression. But 
the traditional cast of the teachers' mind could not 
reahse that the brain is more often a better 
register than the copy-book and that what goes to the 
copy-book generally misses the memory. Bal however 
stuck to his methods. When at work in Mathematics, 
he solved all the examples orally and put down only 
the answer. " Where is your method " asked the precise 
pedagogue. "It is here " said our hero, pointing to 
his head. 

Such an ** unmethodical " and rebellious child was 
never likely to be popular with the teachers, who on oc- 
casions took complaints to his father. Bal cared little for 
their good opinion and less for their " time-honoured '* 
methods. His father was intensely proud of him and 
presaged for him a great career. The promising son of 
the Assistant Deputy Inspector, could not, in those days 
of early marriages, long escape the fetters of wedlock. 
A suitable bride was found in Tapihai, daughter of 
Ballal Bal of Ladghar (Dist. Ratnagiri), to whom he was 
married in 187 1. Soon after this event happened two 
others, the one favourable and the other extremely un- 
fortunate. Bal passed his Matriculation in December 
1872 ; but only a few months before his success in the 
examination his father died, leaving him quite an. 
orphan. ''It is the bitterest element in the vast irony 
of human life that the time-worn eyes, to which a 
son's success would have brought the purest gladness are 
so often closed for ever,even before success has come." * 

When Bal joined (1873) the Deccan College as a resi-

dent student, the Bombay University and its affiliated 
Colleges were not quite as old as their alumni. The 
rough and ready methods of the East India Company's 
Government were, by this time being gradually sub- 
stituted by Institutions more imposing under the direct 
rule of the Queen-Empress. In matters educational, 
Colonel-Professors and Major-Directors were giving 
place to graduates from Oxford and Cambridge ; and 
although this new University ware was not as a rule a 
very great improvement on the former mihtary commo- 
dity, it WcLS, at IccLst, imbued with the atmosphere of the 
EngHsh academies. Howsoever opinions may differ as 
to the value of the knowledge Indian students acquired 
at these Institutions, one thing was certain that they 
were not slow to admire the gowns and caps of the sar- 
torial Major-domoes, in whose orbits it was their destiny 
to fall. 

Persons of pairasitic psychology, whose main purpose 
is to make the present comfortable without a thought 
to the future may deride the idea of National Educa- 
tion. But those who can think for themselves are 
painfully aware of the disadvantages of imbibing foreign 
ideas through a foreign medium at an immature but 
impressionable time of life. The system of education 
transplanted from England to India by well-meaning 
administrators was itself faulty at the very foundation ; 
and the immature graduates of English Universities 
who came out to India as custodians of the New 
learning were entirety innocent of India's storied past 
and the living present. They were quite ignorant of 
the dangers of directing the youthful energies of the 
children of shastris and pundits into the uncongenial 



S LOKAMANYA TILAK 

channels of an alien culture. It was of course im- 
possible for them to impart instruction in the ver- 
naculars. The students were therfore called upon 
to do every intellectual work through a foreign 
medium. The crushing burden of receiving instruction 
through English has been pronounced by competent 
authorities to have " atrophied all originality, research, 
adventure, ceaseless effort, courage and like qualities." 
But the misfortunes of the student-world did not end 
here. The assimination of alien thought at an impres- 
sionable period of life is an unsupportable burden. The 
influence of Shelleys and Byrons, hke that of all narcotics 
is at once exhilerating and depressing. It plants alien 
ideals into the hearts of the young, without affording 
that corrective which a close study of Hindu ideals can 
alone give. The deification of Western culture and 
civilisation inclines the students to apply the crude 
standards of Western materialism to the nobler civilisa- 
tion of this country. It is thus that the cry of Social 
Reform has gone forth. The principles of democracy im- 
mortalised in the passionate writing and speeches of 
Burke, Bright and Gladstone create aspirations diffi- 
cult of realisation in the cramping political atmosphere 
of the country. No wonder that many a graduate has 
found his physical strength and endurance severely 
taxed in his academical life. The spectacle of hundreds 
of bright young men annually leaving the university 
portals as physical wrecks is, in no small measure, 
due to the circumstances detailed above. 

Bal must either have instinctively realized these 
dangers or must have found his fragile frame quite in- 
adequate to the manifestations of the mighty spirit 



MR. BLUNT. 9 

^thm. For, soon after joining the Deccan College he 
determined to lay the foundation of that physical 
strength and endurance, which, in spite of worries and 
hard intellectual work stood him in good stead 
during the whole of his life. For full one year, 
he neglected his studies and devoted practically all 
his time exclusively to physical culture. Swimming, 
boating and wrestling were his pastimes. Morning and 
evening he passed through a severe course of Indian 
gymnastics. At the end of the year, he failed in his F. 
A. examination but he succeeded in his ambition and 
became a robust young man. Instead of being required 
to measure the quantity of his daily food, his powers of 
digestion were wonderfully developed. When some years 
later, he had an occasion to take food for a few months 
in an hotel at Bombay, the manager found him the least 
profitable of all customers. He could now stand the 
rigours of heat and cold and could with impunity spend 
hours together in physical or mental work. Even in 
1900, when his health was unsatisfactory and he 
could hardly be said to have recovered from the shock 
of the prison-Hfe of 1897-98, he swam across the 
Ganges — a distance of more than a quarter of a mile. 
Once asked the secret of his intellectual tenacity, Mr. 
Tilak particularly referred to this period of his youth 
and said " If one only attends to one's body as one 
does to one's mind from the age of 16 to that of 25, 
and if the physical strength thus stored up is not 
dissipated by gluttony or vice, one can stand any 
amount of hard intellectual work till old age." 

This acquisition of health and strenth increased the 
buoyancy of his mind and he heartily joined in all the 



10 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

innocent pranks of College-life. He however knew 
where to draw the line between such innocent diversions 
and culpable mischief. He also knew how to despise the 
mistaken gentility of apathetic natures. His restless 
intellect, unfatigued by the rigours of stud}/" occasional- 
ly found diversion in heated discussions with his fellow- 
students. His outspokenness earned for him the title 
of Mr. Blunt. There is nothing paradoxical in the in- 
tellectual acuteness and social bluntness of Mr. TUak. 
These qualities can otherwise be named as social and 
intellectual "directness." No beating about the bush, 
but running straight to the subject in hand — that was 
his characteristic. His critical faculty had abnormally 
developed, and like young George Washington playing 
with his axe, he used it on any and every subject that 
came in his way. His innate bias for the classical litera- 
ture of his country, however, saved him from being the 
slave of his reason ; and the excesses of the Social 
Reformers of the day made him shrink from accepting 
their gospel without reserve. 

Two professors — Principal Wordsworth and Prof. 
Chhatre — of Mr. Tilak's College-days stood head and 
shoulders above their contemporaries not only by 
reason of their profound learning and inimitable 
teaching but also by their noble character. Till the 
end of his life Mr. Tilak ungrudingiy admitted the 
high moral and intellectual equipment they brought 
to their work. They were Gurus in the real sense of 
the term. 

Out of Mr. Tilak's college-companions, Messrs. Mule, 
Sharangpani and Kathavte, though not quite so well 
known, have, in their own way distinguished themsel-

ves. Others — Messrs. Shridhar Balkrishna Upasani, 
Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Vamanrao Apte, Daji Abaji 
Khare, Ganesh S. Khaparde, R. N. Mudholkar, Dayaram 
Gidumal — need no introduction to our readers. Mr. 
(Dr. Sir) N. G. Chandavarkar, too was a contemporary 
oi Mr. Tilak, though studying in a different college. 
He passed his B. A. examination in the same year with 
Mr. Tilak (1876). Both Tilak and Chandavarkar secu- 
red a first Class in the B. A. examination. 

The Mathematical abilities of Mr. Tilak were of the 
highest order and were fully and frankly recognised by 
Prof. Chhatre who, in those days was considered to be 
the premier Mathematician of the Presidency. Mr. 
TUak's mathematical training, coupled with his fine 
classical study gave his genius that logical and ima-

ginative bent which excites the admiration of the 
readers of the Gita-Rahasya and the Arctic Home in the 
Vedas. 

His utter disregard of praise and scholarships was 
not due to the perfunctory method of his studies but 
rather the reverse. If one were to analyse the prize- 
hunters' mentality, it will be found that their studies 
are not the outcome of a love of knowledge but the show 
of it. The one aim of Mr. Tilak's life was the acquisi- 
tion of the intrinsic and so all the rewards resulting from 
the attainment of merely marketable knowledge had no 
charm for him. His reading was extensive and 
thorough ; while reading for examination the history of 
the reigns of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, he 
studied about a dozen standard authors and made his 
own notes. While preparing for the LL. B. examina- 
tion, instead of contenting himself with reading Hindu 
Law from English writers he went straight to the foun- 
tain-head and studied Yajnavalkya and other authori- 
ties. He also read all the important Acts passed by the 
Government of India since 1827. The closeness of his 
application to studies and his ready and prolonged 
concentration therein were the wonder of his 
friends ; and there was another quality which 
is equally, if not still more rare, the innate 
purity of his mind. Mr. Upsani, his life-long 
friend recalling those three years of Bombay-life 
says " I shared Mr. Tilak's room while both of us

were students of Law at Bombay ; and I don't remem- 
ber a single occasion when he gave expression to any 
unworthy thought." Happy the youth which, Uke a 
lotus, can grow, unsulUed and uncontaminated, in the 
muddy water of worldly Ufe and which, the moment it 
is full blown is dedicated to the service of the Mother- 
land. For such sacred worship, only the freshest, the 
most fragrant and unsmelt flowers are necessary. Mr. 
Tilak passed his LL. B. in December 1879.

### FOREWORD 



When the author asked me to write out a 
foreword when I was in Bombay in the 
month of June, I readily consented, because 
I thought that he would forget all about it 
after I left. But the author is inexorable 
and here am I trying to dictate a foreword. 

It is difficult for me to say anything about 
the late Lokamanya, as I feel overwhelmed 
whenever I think of his greatness. Yet his 
greatness was so simple. No analysis of his 
genius or character is possible because of 
that very simplicity. I confess I cannot 
analyse his greatness ; I can only say what 
has been said from a thousand platforms in 
India that he was a man of whom India is 
proud. 

It is unnecessary for me to refer to his love 
of country, pride of race, indomitable courage, 
unflagging perseverance and spirit of sacrifice 
which made his activities so real. All these 
are a matter of record in the recent history 
of Indian Nationalism.

It has often been said that the Late Lokamanya 
was a practical politician and not an 
idealist with a vision. I naturally shrink 
from an attempt to classify his genius. The 
character of a truly great man defies classifi- 
cation. I shall relate one little incident of 
his life and leave the readers to put what 
name they please to his genius. In 1906, 
when the Congress was held in Calcutta the 
Lokamanya and many of my Maharashtra 
friends were my guests. One day during his 
visit a gentleman from Lucknow came to 
see him. I was present. This gentleman was 
a Moderate in politics and began to speak 
somewhat angrily. He accused Lokamanya 
of creating dissensions in the Congress camp 
and said "Do you know what the Maho- 
medans are doing ? They are combining 
against the Hindus and trying to start a 
Pan-Islamic movement." Lokamanya's eyes 
glistened. He said, "Are you sure?". This 
gentleman got very angry. He said " Sure ? 
I am as sure as I am here talking to you. I. 
have seen some of the letters. Whilst you 
are dividing the Hindus, the Mahomedans 
are uniting to crush us." To my surprise, 
Lokamanya said with a smile, which it is 
impossible for me to describe. "Then is 
our deliverance at hand. Don't you see the 
moment the ^Mahomedans combine, that 
moment the Government will be at them. 
The moment the Government is at them, 
that very moment they will unite with us." 
It was after this that the Moslem League was 
started in open opposition to the I. N. Con- 
gress. It was after this that the Moslem 
League strove and worked in perfect unity 
with the I. N. Congress. It was after this 
that the Hindu-Moslem Unity was declared 
a crime in the Punjab. Now we all know. 
Was he a practical politician ? Was he an 
idealist with a vision ?

###PREFACE 



The story of the Life of Lokamanya Tilak 
is the history of Western India during the 
1 ast forty years ; it is the history of the birth 
and growth of Indian NationaUsm, its im- 
pact on the Indian Bureaucracy, its vicissi- 
tudes, its struggles, disappointments, suc- 
cesses and reverses. To attempt a task of 
such magnitude, so eminently fit for a philo- 
sopher-historian is at any time a " stroke of 
temerity." It is still more so at the present 
juncture when the ashes of the controver- 
sies in which Mr. Tilak so prominently 
figured are hot. Though dead, Mr. Tilak 
still lives in our midst ; and the time is not 
yet for a pronouncement of the final verdict 
of History upon him. That is evidently a 
work for the next generation when the bio- 
grapher or historian will be fortified in his 
judgment by the knowledge of the ultimate 
success or failure of Mr. Tilak's methods 
and those of his opponents. My task is 
comparatively modest ; and though my diffi- 
culties are infinitely greater than those of 
the future historian, a contemporary biogra- 
pher has obvious advantages over him. 

Throughout the succeeding narrative, I 
have never tried to conceal my bias for Mr. 
Tilak. Nor will the reader — Moderate or 
Extremist, Brahmin or Non-Brahmin, Indian 
or European — except me to do so. I have 
however, to the best of my ability, scrupulous- 
ly adhered to truth. Not being closely identi- 
fied with party principles, personalities and 
prejudices, I can claim to have judged Mr. 
Tilak's opponents sympathetically. I have 
as great a regard for Ranade as for Vishnu- 
shastri Chiploonkar ; and if in the following 
pages the reader finds any lapses from the 
standard of fair criticism set by me, he 
should unhesitatingly attribute them rather 
to an imperfect comprehension of truth than 
to any conscious desire of misrepresenting 
Mr. Tilak's opponents. Mr. Tilak's great- 
ness is so immense and self-evident that it 
stands in no need of any exggeration or 
misrepresentation. 

The idea of writing a life of the Loka- 
manya was dimly and vaguely floating in 
my mind for a number of years. It recurred 
to me again and again when, taking advantage 
of the obscurity which hung over his earher 
activities, many of his enthusiastic oppo- 
nents in Western India actively set themselves 
to indulge in cheap gibes by irreverential and 
by no means fair references to what they 
considered to be his mistakes. In this, they 
can be pardoned for, being young, these 
opponents might have been the dupes of mis- 
understandings born in an atmosphere of 
party prejudices. But their attacks cer- 
tainly led me to go beneath the surface of 
things and inquire w^hat truth there was in 
them. And after three year's patient work, 
I find that Mr. Tilak's activities, far from 
having the shortcomings and inconsistencies 
of a political opportunist, have all the well- 
sustained unity of a beautiful drama, in 
which each scene is organically related to 
the preceding and to the succeeding and all 
together make one harmonious whole. 

It would have been almost impossible for 
me to do this laborious work without the 
active co-operation of my friends. Their 
number is legion. I shall take this oppor- 
tunity of thanking only a few of them ; and 
if I have to omit individual reference to all, 
that is due to the limits of an ordinary pre- 
face. Mr. M. R. Paranjpye, Principal of the 
Gokuldas Tejpal High School, Bombay, kind- 
ly undertook to help me in revising the 
work. Mr. Annasahib Sapre and Mr. Kar- 
melkar prepared the Press-copy in an in- 
credibly short time. I must also thank Mr. 
M. K. David and Mr. Bhausahib Oak for 
having helped me in a variety of ways. 
Even then I should hardly have hoped of 
accomplishing this task but for the sponta- 
neous assistance rendered bv Prof. Haribhau 
Tulpule, Mr. D. K. Sathe and Mr. Annasahib 
Chiploonkar, who during the last ten months 
had placed their services entirely at my dis- 
posal. 

The credit of having supplied the excellent 
paper on which this book is published, goes 
entirely to Mr. M. R. Joshi, Paper-merchant, 
Poona. Mr. Nanasahib Gondhalekar, the 
enterprising Proprietor of the Jagaddhitecchu 
Press, Poona, must both be praised and thank- 
ed for having printed off this book in five 
short weeks on his new Monotype machine. 

While this Preface was being written, news 
has arrived that Mr. C. R. Das, President- 
elect of the forth-coming Congress has been 
arrested. I must sincerely thank him for 
having snatched an odd minute to write a 
foreword when his mind was distracted by the 
troubles brewing in Bengal. 

The unique feature of Mr. Tilak's career is 
that, like a magnet it draws all. While 
the populace claim him as one of their own, 
aristocrats recognize that he represented, in 
his intellectual and spiritual eminence, a 
nobler aristocracy than has fallen to their lot. 
Old persons feel interest in the romance of 
his career ; the middle-aged derive instruc- 
tion therefrom. On the younger generation, 
the influence of Mr. Tilak's life is still deeper. 
It not only interests and instructs but in- 
spires the mind to a performance of great 
deeds. Like the story of the Pandavas, it is 
bound to go down to generations unborn as 
an eternal source of inspiration.

## MR. BLUNT 

Oh hush thee' my baby, the time soon will come 
When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum; 
Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may. 
For strife comes with manhood and waking with day. 

Scott 

The highest praise that has yet been accorded to 
Lokamanya Tilak has come, curiously enough, from the 
Hon. Mr. Gokhale who is reported to have said to an 
Enghsh friend that, bom a hundred and twenty years 
before, Mr. Tilak would have carved out a kingdom for 
himself. This pithiest and most appropriate compli- 
ment pictures for us Mr. Tilak as he really was, not a 
product of the Western Civilisation and of the English 
Government but a solitary surviver of the race which 
four generations back had well-nigh conquered the whole 
of India. It was impossible for him to be assimilated, 
like most of his countrjTnen by and in the mighty 
Enghsh Government ; nor could that Government crush 
his spirit and make him a helpless spectator of our 

downfall. He was every inch a soldier a soldier 

in a civilians' garb. The Press and the Plaftorm were 
his field of action; and from this battlefield he waged 



2 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

a relentless war on the Indian Bureaucracy for nearly 
forty years. He alone of all others dared strike the 
shield of the Government with the " sharp end of the 
steel." The silent suffering country wanted a man 
who could speak out without mincing matters, one who 
could boldly stand up for cur birth-right held in pawn 
by the rulers of the land. Where could such an one be 
found except in the great Mahratta race ? 

Bal Gangadar Tilak was born at Ratnagiri on July 
23rd, 1856. Bom in a race to which the Peshwas be- 
longed and in a town not far away from the birth-place 
of Balaji Vishwanath, he WcLS, indeed, destined to play 
the role of a representative of those who had ruled the 
greater part of India for nearly a hundred years. In 
the year of his birth the political atmosphere in India 
was electric. It was a remarkable year for this re- 
markable child to be ushered into existence. It was as 
ominous to the new nilers of the land as this child was 
destined to be. Lord Dalhousie, the last of the aggres- 
sive proconsuls of the British East India Company had 
just departed, cutting off all the Native poppies that 
dared appear tall among the degenarates of the van- 
quished races of India, and while he was thus stretching 
the red canvas over the country, the last vestiges of the 
Imperial families of Delhi and of Satara were 
swept away, witfi the result that he left a legacy as 
fatal to his successor as Lord Chelmsford has done 
to the present Viceroy. Hindus and Mahomedans 
smarting under the humiliation of eclipsed crescent 
and BJiagva Zenda had made common cause. 
The unity was no doubt temporary, the result of a 
common wrong ; the essential condition for a successful 



MR. BLUNT 3 

revolution was wanting, the proletariat being unwilling 
to be disturbed by the wails and woes of the feudal 
landlords with their figure-head Royalties. So the 
rising ended in smoke, making the Enghsh still more 
secure in the land. 

Thus it was that when Bal, the only son and second 
child of Gangadharpant {alias Nana) Tilak was passing 
the early days of his life in his home at Ratnagiri, re- 
markable deeds of grim valour and cruel carnage were 
an every-day occurance in distant Delhi. The red 
fury of inflamed soldiery that had set the whole country 
ablaze must have borne its flues and sparks to the 
birth-place of our hero, at least in the form of a wonder- 
ful crop of rumours. It is inconceivable that the green 
memory of these things should have failed to impress 
the imagination of a child whose whole life was a dedi- 
cation to the service of the Motherland. 

What httle is known of Bal's mother shows that she 
was a kind-hearted and an intensely religious woman. 
His father was one of those gems " of purest ray serene" 
that for want of favourable opportunities lie concealed 
in the deep " caverns of the ocean." Bom in August 
1820, he had passed the early years of his boyhood in 
dreaming dreams of learning and high social position 
and had, after finishing his vernacular course of instruc- 
tion at Dabhol (Dist. Ratnagiri), walked over, in those 
days of difficult travelling to Poona. At a time when 
a boy learning English had every kind of encouragement 
given to him. Nana would surely have been able to cc«n- 
plete his studies ; but a domestic misfortune compelled 
him to bid good-bye to all his ambitions and rest con- 
tent, as a school master, with the " splendid " salary of 



4 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Rs. 10 per mensem. But though he was thus called 
upon to waste his abilities in the cramping atmos- 
phere of vernacular school-life, he never neglected his 
duties nor did he abandon his favourite pursuit of 
knowledge. All his leisure was devoted to the 
study of Mathematics, Sanskrit and Marathi ; and 
his mastery over the several branches of these sub- 
jects enabled him to bring out two books, the 
one on Trigonometry and the other on Marathi 
Grammar. But neither the scholarship of Gangadharpant 
nor his conscientious discharge of duties could make 
his superiors forget or overlook his stern sense of 
personal independence. The inevitable consequence 
followed : he was neglected in official preferment. 
It was only after full 17 years of service, when 
his claims could not with decency be set aside, that he 
was rewarded with the much-coveted post of an Assist- 
ant Deputy Educational Inspector and was transferred 
to Poona (1866). 

The intensely religious vein of the mother and the 
stem sense of personal independence of the father re- 
flected themselves in the wilful nature of the boy, a 
characteristic which has played no insignificant part in 
his future career. This delicate child of a delicate 
mother was not put to school before he was 11, not cer- 
tainly for want of facilities — Ratnagiri was a District 
town — but evidently because, the father, himself a 
school-master, intended to give his son a good ground- 
ing in Sanskrit and vernacular in the unfettered free- 
dom of home-life. Bal proved wonderfully responsive 
to his father's instructions. He loved his childish plays 
no doubt, but, evea at that age the ponderous volumes 



MR. BLUKT 5 

in his father's library impressed him more. One 
book particularly attracted his fancy. He had heard 
his father reading the sonorous periods of Bana's 
Kadamhari and believing the book to be no more diffi- 
cult than the holy Sanskrit verses he was set to recite 
every evening, he went up to his father and asked for 
the loan of the book. Startled with the request, but un- 
willing to dispirit his son by a curt refusal Gangadhar- 
pant promised to give the book on one condition. A 
knotty problem in Arithmetic was set ; Bal was to 
work it out and have the book. Armed with slate and 
pencil, Bal waged a relentless war on the problem for 
an hour and a half and carried off the prize amidst the 
applause of the proud mother and the loving sister. 

This was the first triumph of Bal's life. His poor 
mother did not live to see others. Her health, natural- 
ly delicate, undermined by frequent fasting gave way 
and she died (1866) before realising an Indian mother's 
ambition of getting her son married. Sometime later, 
Bal was sent to school. He jumped from standard to 
standard and was soon transferred to the Poona High 
School whence he matriculated in 1872. The rigid for- 
mality of the classes, with its accompaniment of church- 
yard silence utterly disgusted him. The spectacle of 
mediocre teachers hammering scrappy stuff, styled 
knowledge into the mediocre brains of students was not 
calculated to charm a boy to whom reading was under- 
standing and committing to memory no labour. The 
race of marks and of rank could never allure him; 
His unwillingness to take down notes and translations 
was an enigma to his teachers. He was content that he 
had learnt the lessons and was quite indifferent to the 



h LOKAMANYA TILAK 



u 



expression. He cared more for knowledge than for 
words, more for thoughts than for the expression. But 
the traditional cast of the teachers' mind could not 
reahse that the brain is more often a better 
register than the copy-book and that what goes to the 
copy-book generally misses the memory. Bal however 
stuck to his methods. When at work in Mathematics, 
he solved all the examples orally and put down only 
the answer. " Where is your method " asked the precise 
pedagogue. "It is here " said our hero, pointing to 
his head. 

Such an ** unmethodical " and rebellious child was 
never likely to be popular with the teachers, who on oc- 
casions took complaints to his father. Bal cared little for 
their good opinion and less for their " time-honoured '* 
methods. His father was intensely proud of him and 
presaged for him a great career. The promising son of 
the Assistant Deputy Inspector, could not, in those days 
of early marriages, long escape the fetters of wedlock. 
A suitable bride was found in Tapihai, daughter of 
Ballal Bal of Ladghar (Dist. Ratnagiri), to whom he was 
married in 187 1. Soon after this event happened two 
others, the one favourable and the other extremely un- 
fortunate. Bal passed his Matriculation in December 
1872 ; but only a few months before his success in the 
examination his father died, leaving him quite an. 
orphan. ''It is the bitterest element in the vast irony 
of human life that the time-worn eyes, to which a 
son's success would have brought the purest gladness are 
so often closed for ever,even before success has come." * 

When Bal joined (1873) the Deccan College as a resi- 

* Morley's Life of Cobden, 



MR. BLUNT 7 

dent student, the Bombay University and its affiliated 
Colleges were not quite as old as their alumni. The 
rough and ready methods of the East India Company's 
Government were, by this time being gradually sub- 
stituted by Institutions more imposing under the direct 
rule of the Queen-Empress. In matters educational, 
Colonel-Professors and Major-Directors were giving 
place to graduates from Oxford and Cambridge ; and 
although this new University ware was not as a rule a 
very great improvement on the former mihtary commo- 
dity, it WcLS, at IccLst, imbued with the atmosphere of the 
EngHsh academies. Howsoever opinions may differ as 
to the value of the knowledge Indian students acquired 
at these Institutions, one thing was certain that they 
were not slow to admire the gowns and caps of the sar- 
torial Major-domoes, in whose orbits it was their destiny 
to fall. 

Persons of pairasitic psychology, whose main purpose 
is to make the present comfortable without a thought 
to the future may deride the idea of National Educa- 
tion. But those who can think for themselves are 
painfully aware of the disadvantages of imbibing foreign 
ideas through a foreign medium at an immature but 
impressionable time of life. The system of education 
transplanted from England to India by well-meaning 
administrators was itself faulty at the very foundation ; 
and the immature graduates of English Universities 
who came out to India as custodians of the New 
learning were entirety innocent of India's storied past 
and the living present. They were quite ignorant of 
the dangers of directing the youthful energies of the 
children of shastris and pundits into the uncongenial 



S LOKAMANYA TILAK 

channels of an alien culture. It was of course im- 
possible for them to impart instruction in the ver- 
naculars. The students were therfore called upon 
to do every intellectual work through a foreign 
medium. The crushing burden of receiving instruction 
through English has been pronounced by competent 
authorities to have " atrophied all originality, research, 
adventure, ceaseless effort, courage and like qualities." 
But the misfortunes of the student-world did not end 
here. The assimination of alien thought at an impres- 
sionable period of life is an unsupportable burden. The 
influence of Shelleys and Byrons, hke that of all narcotics 
is at once exhilerating and depressing. It plants alien 
ideals into the hearts of the young, without affording 
that corrective which a close study of Hindu ideals can 
alone give. The deification of Western culture and 
civilisation inclines the students to apply the crude 
standards of Western materialism to the nobler civilisa- 
tion of this country. It is thus that the cry of Social 
Reform has gone forth. The principles of democracy im- 
mortalised in the passionate writing and speeches of 
Burke, Bright and Gladstone create aspirations diffi- 
cult of realisation in the cramping political atmosphere 
of the country. No wonder that many a graduate has 
found his physical strength and endurance severely 
taxed in his academical life. The spectacle of hundreds 
of bright young men annually leaving the university 
portals as physical wrecks is, in no small measure, 
due to the circumstances detailed above. 

Bal must either have instinctively realized these 
dangers or must have found his fragile frame quite in- 
adequate to the manifestations of the mighty spirit 



MR. BLUNT. 9 

^thm. For, soon after joining the Deccan College he 
determined to lay the foundation of that physical 
strength and endurance, which, in spite of worries and 
hard intellectual work stood him in good stead 
during the whole of his life. For full one year, 
he neglected his studies and devoted practically all 
his time exclusively to physical culture. Swimming, 
boating and wrestling were his pastimes. Morning and 
evening he passed through a severe course of Indian 
gymnastics. At the end of the year, he failed in his F. 
A. examination but he succeeded in his ambition and 
became a robust young man. Instead of being required 
to measure the quantity of his daily food, his powers of 
digestion were wonderfully developed. When some years 
later, he had an occasion to take food for a few months 
in an hotel at Bombay, the manager found him the least 
profitable of all customers. He could now stand the 
rigours of heat and cold and could with impunity spend 
hours together in physical or mental work. Even in 
1900, when his health was unsatisfactory and he 
could hardly be said to have recovered from the shock 
of the prison-Hfe of 1897-98, he swam across the 
Ganges — a distance of more than a quarter of a mile. 
Once asked the secret of his intellectual tenacity, Mr. 
Tilak particularly referred to this period of his youth 
and said " If one only attends to one's body as one 
does to one's mind from the age of 16 to that of 25, 
and if the physical strength thus stored up is not 
dissipated by gluttony or vice, one can stand any 
amount of hard intellectual work till old age." 

This acquisition of health and strenth increased the 
buoyancy of his mind and he heartily joined in all the 



10 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

innocent pranks of College-life. He however knew 
where to draw the line between such innocent diversions 
and culpable mischief. He also knew how to despise the 
mistaken gentility of apathetic natures. His restless 
intellect, unfatigued by the rigours of stud}/" occasional- 
ly found diversion in heated discussions with his fellow- 
students. His outspokenness earned for him the title 
of Mr. Blunt. There is nothing paradoxical in the in- 
tellectual acuteness and social bluntness of Mr. TUak. 
These qualities can otherwise be named as social and 
intellectual "directness." No beating about the bush, 
but running straight to the subject in hand — that was 
his characteristic. His critical faculty had abnormally 
developed, and like young George Washington playing 
with his axe, he used it on any and every subject that 
came in his way. His innate bias for the classical litera- 
ture of his country, however, saved him from being the 
slave of his reason ; and the excesses of the Social 
Reformers of the day made him shrink from accepting 
their gospel without reserve. 

Two professors — Principal Wordsworth and Prof. 
Chhatre — of Mr. Tilak's College-days stood head and 
shoulders above their contemporaries not only by 
reason of their profound learning and inimitable 
teaching but also by their noble character. Till the 
end of his life Mr. Tilak ungrudingiy admitted the 
high moral and intellectual equipment they brought 
to their work. They were Gurus in the real sense of 
the term. 

Out of Mr. Tilak's college-companions, Messrs. Mule, 
Sharangpani and Kathavte, though not quite so well 
known, have, in their own way distinguished themsel-

ves. Others — Messrs. Shridhar Balkrishna Upasani, 
Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Vamanrao Apte, Daji Abaji 
Khare, Ganesh S. Khaparde, R. N. Mudholkar, Dayaram 
Gidumal — need no introduction to our readers. Mr. 
(Dr. Sir) N. G. Chandavarkar, too was a contemporary 
oi Mr. Tilak, though studying in a different college. 
He passed his B. A. examination in the same year with 
Mr. Tilak (1876). Both Tilak and Chandavarkar secu- 
red a first Class in the B. A. examination. 

The Mathematical abilities of Mr. Tilak were of the 
highest order and were fully and frankly recognised by 
Prof. Chhatre who, in those days was considered to be 
the premier Mathematician of the Presidency. Mr. 
TUak's mathematical training, coupled with his fine 
classical study gave his genius that logical and ima-

ginative bent which excites the admiration of the 
readers of the Gita-Rahasya and the Arctic Home in the 
Vedas. 

His utter disregard of praise and scholarships was 
not due to the perfunctory method of his studies but 
rather the reverse. If one were to analyse the prize- 
hunters' mentality, it will be found that their studies 
are not the outcome of a love of knowledge but the show 
of it. The one aim of Mr. Tilak's life was the acquisi- 
tion of the intrinsic and so all the rewards resulting from 
the attainment of merely marketable knowledge had no 
charm for him. His reading was extensive and 
thorough ; while reading for examination the history of 
the reigns of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, he 
studied about a dozen standard authors and made his 
own notes. While preparing for the LL. B. examina- 
tion, instead of contenting himself with reading Hindu 
Law from English writers he went straight to the foun- 
tain-head and studied Yajnavalkya and other authori- 
ties. He also read all the important Acts passed by the 
Government of India since 1827. The closeness of his 
application to studies and his ready and prolonged 
concentration therein were the wonder of his 
friends ; and there was another quality which 
is equally, if not still more rare, the innate 
purity of his mind. Mr. Upsani, his life-long 
friend recalling those three years of Bombay-life 
says " I shared Mr. Tilak's room while both of us 



f^[^f^ =^ 5at^JHTHi% 51^ ^%^ W ^: II ^^11 



MR. BLUNT. 13; 

were students of Law at Bombay ; and I don't remem- 
ber a single occasion when he gave expression to any

is full blown is dedicated to the service of the Mother- 
land. For such sacred worship, only the freshest, the 
most fragrant and unsmelt flowers are necessary. Mr. 
Tilak passed his LL. B. in December 1879.

forever the smile from his lips and joy from his mind 
and thenceforth the Lord of Compassion devoted all his 
energies to the solution of the problem of misery. 
Mr. Tilak's youthful thoughts, too, were clouded by 
three great events, which produced an indelible im- 
pression on his sensitive spirit and here we must seek 
for the motive which led him to dedicate his life to 
the service of the Mother-land. The lirst of these 
events was the deposition (1875) of the late H. H. 
Malharrao Gaekwar and his subsequent trial, by a 
special commission, on the charge of having attempted 
to poison his Resident Col. Phayre. People in the 
Baroda State and outside, strongly believed in the in- 
nocence of the Maharaja who was not restored to his 
throne though the Commission differed in its findings. 
The; fate of a hapless Indian Prince, who ought to

have got at least the benefit of doubt created a deep 
wound in Mr. Tilak's mind ; for its patriotism was 
not outlandish, based merely on the perusal of the 
works of Mill and Bright. It was essentially Indian, 
and was directly derived from a contemplation of 
the great and heroic deeds of Shivaji and his descend- 
ants. The Maratha History of the 17th and i8th Centu- 
ries formed the Bible of his patriotism and his blood 
was aflame when he reflected on the utter impotence 
to which the representatives of the Empire-builders 
of the 1 8th century were reduced. 

If the rumbling of a widespread insurrection at- 
tended the birth of Mr. Tilak, the year of his gradu- 
ation (1876) was marked by an abortive attempt 
to overturn the British Government. This attempt 
was confined only to some parts of Maharashtra. Its 
authors were a few fanatics under the leadership of 
Wasudeo Balvant Phadke, a clerk in Government 
employ. The enthusiasm of these people far exceeded 
their limitations. They had neither birth nor fortune 
to impress the imagination of the public. Wasudeo 
Balvant scarcely took note of the practical disappear- 
ance of the martial instincts of the race, the apathy 
and ignorance of the masses, the denationalisation of 
the classes, the sloth of the degenerate descendants of 
the old aristocracy. His attempts were doomed to 
failure ; and they could only bring with them their 
inevitable legacy — repression and suspicion. The 
Brahmins — Poona Brahmins especially — were the 
greatest sufferers. Even a ' model ' Moderate like 
Ranade, whose only ' mistake ' in life was a youthful 
essay on Shivaji, that deprived him temporarily of 



l6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

his fellowship in the Elphinst©ne College did not 
escape suspicion. The impression of the two up- 
heavels of 1857 ^^^ ^^7^ on the mind of Mr. Tilak 
was in inverse proportion to their magnitude and 
importance. The former was an incident which hap- 
pened when he was quite a baby and so the impres- 
sion which he formed concerning it in his boyhood 
was necessarily hazy. In the case of the latter, our 
hero was a full-fledged gentleman, well-armed and 
equipped with knowledge and reason. He saw how 
immature, thoughtless and foolish the attempt of 
Wasudev Balavant was ; and from this time must be 
dated his horror of bloody revolutions. He clearly 
saw that if Indians had to fight with Anglo-Indian 
despots, it could only be, not with sword and gun, 
but with pen and tongue. He saw that the secret of 
the English power in India lay in their superior edu- 
cation and organisation, and that we could wrest that 
power only by meeting the English on their own 
ground. The collection of a few fire-arms and the 
slaughter of a handful of of&cials would not shake 
the well-established British Government in India and 
such attempts would only recoil upon us by rivetting 
our chains. 

The third event that impressed his youthful heart was 
the terrible famine of 1877-8 with its toll of 50 lakhs 
of lives. He passed sleepless nights and began to find 
out the cause of such an abnormal condition. 
Throughout his life Mr. Tilak was a friend of the 
poor. Even Mr. Nevinson, a casual acquaintance of 
his was impressed with Mr. Tilak's concern for the 
poor. It was here, in this terrible famine of 1877-8, 



THE FISRT OKDEAL I7 

that his sympathy for the poor was roused. To add 
insult to injury, the advisers of Queen Victoria the 
Good induced her to assume the title of ** Kaiser- 
i-Hind " in this very year of famine and starvation. 

The impressions of these events were strengthened by 
the companionship of a congenial friend and the mes- 
sage of an inspiring leader. Since 1874, the young men 
of Maharashtra were watching with passionate enthu- 
siasm the appearance of a luminary in the literary 
firmament of Poona. This luminary was no other 
than the illustrious Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, son 
of Krishnashastri, the memory of whose ability and 
learning is still green. The hcuse of Krishnashastri 
was the favourite resort of all the leading hghts of 
Maharashtra; and of the interesting and instructive 
discourses cf his father, Vishnu, shy and studious, 
silent and thoughtful, was an attentive listener. So 
when, after passing the Matriculation he joined the 
Deccan College, he could carry thither a correctness of 
taste and a depth and variety of knowledge which 
many graduates could not claim. While many of his 
fellow-students were abusing the liberty of college- 
life and the liberality of their parents in a variey of 
ways, the excesses of Vishnu were merely intellectual 
and amounted to nothing more than a passionate 
study of history and literature, to the neglect of 
Logic and Mathematics. After graduation in 1872, 
he was persuaded to accept a school-master's post in 
the Educational Department, but this did not prevent 
from starting, in 1874, the famous magazine, the 
Nibandhamala, which by its magnificent rhetorical 
style and trenchant criticism of the Government and 
2 



l8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

of the social and religious movements of the day won 
instant renown. It was clear that the pioneer of a 
new School of National thought had arisen, able and 
eager to fight with the pajty led by Ranade. 

The intellectual plane o! Ranade was certainly more 
elevated than that of Chiploonkar. In profundity 
of thought, in depth and variety of learning he was 
unequalled. He had tried his best to organise and dis- 
cipline a generation of social and religious iconoclasts. 
He had tried to lead the destructive and rebellious spirit 
of his time into the constructive channels of Social 
Reform. He wanted to build a Rationalistic Church 
out of the materalistic and agnostic elements born of 
Western education. On the other hand, Vishnusha:stri, 
instead of trying to " reform " the people, wanted to 
rouse them to a consciousness of the glory of their 
history and religion. Heartily disgusted with the 
shallowness of the public movements of his time, he 
called upon the rising generation to make sacrifices ; 
and he himself led the way by " snapping asunder 
(1879) the chain (of ser\dce) once and for ever " and 
resolved " to try what might be done for public good 
with the potent instrumentality of a press establish- 
ment worked by a vigorous hand.'* 

The example and message of Vishnushastri had 
undoubtedly a stimulating effect upon Mr, Tilak. They 
also influenced Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mr. Tilak's chief 
companion in the Deccan College. The early life of 
this remarkable man was one long fight with " chill 
penury.'* Neglected by relatives, occasionally insulted 
by those whose help he had to seek, this man had 
faith enough to grapple, undaunted, with every diM- 



THE FIRST ORDEAL. I9 

^ulty. When taunted with poverty he had the spirit 
to tell his teacher — a distinguished M.A. — that he, toe, 
ivould some day take the degree of Master of Arts. 
Poverty has *' repressed '* many a " noble rage ." It 
sours a man and makes him cynical. But even 
stark povery failed to repress the noble instincts of 
Agarkar. Not a wrong in this world but had him as 
its champion ; not a cause of liberty or reform but 
gained his support. A student of Logic and Moral 
Philosophy, he had lost much of his faith in religion. 
But there was another Faith, to him higher and 
nobler, a Faith which evoked the finest quahties of 
his heart. The pent-up and ungratified desires of long 
poverty generally tempt a man to their enjoyment at 
the first opportunity. But such was the greatness of 
Agarkar that when such an opportunity was within 
his easy reach, he wrote to his mother " You may be 
waiting, mother dear, for your son to become an 
M. A. and Hft you up from all the misery that haunts 
you. I, however, have decided to turn my back on 
money and happiness and dedicate my life to the 
service of the country." This utter self-denial, after 
a life of stark poverty would alone establish Agarkar's 
title to the ever-lasting gratitude of his countrymen. 

There was one point on which Tilak and Agarkar 
-did not agree, even in their college days ; it was Social 
Reform. While admitting the existence of evils and 
the necessity of eradicating them, Mr. Tilak held 
that reform, to be lasting, could only be a growth from 
within ; that hasty measures and intemperate talk 
would only retard the cause of reform; that refortn 
should not be mere imitation of Western life arid 



20 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

culture but should be based on a proper understanding 
of the genius of our race and the traditions of our 
society ; that the key-note of Indian life is purity 
more than freedom and that in all programmes of 
social reform we cannot too much lay stress on this 
cardinal principle. 

But though the attitude of Tilak towards Social 
Reform differed essentially from that of Agarkar, still 
they were agreed that this difference in view-point 
should not prevent both from co-operating with each 
other with respect to the main part of the 
programme which was education in the widest 
sense of the term. To cover the Presidency with a 
net-work of schools was only a part of their aspira- 
tions. They wanted to do something more ; they 
wanted to educate the masses by imparting to them 
democratic ideas and enlightening them on the 
true state of the country. The birth of the New 
English School on the one hand and of the Kescrl and 
the Mahratta on the other, heralded in Maharashtra a 
new era and galvanised its public life and the credit of 
this achievement must be given to Chiploonkar, Tilak 
and Agarkar. 

To this band of enthusiastic workers, Ranade gave 
his blessings and something more ; he recommended to 
their notice Mahadeo Ballal Namjoshi, whose versatile 
powers, keen perception, sound experience and tactful, 
pushing nature more than compensated for his lack of 
academic training. Mr. Namjoshi's indefatigable 
•energy and immense resourcefulness helped his col- 
leagues to tide over numerous crises and earned for 
him the title of " our foreign secretary." To Tilak,. 



THE HRST ORDEAL 21 

he pariicularly attached himself; and the ahnost bro 
iherly friendship that sprang between them remained 
unclouded till 1895, when Namjoshi closed his brilliant 
career without leaving the wherewithal to perform his 
funeral ceremony. 

Another man, not less useful, joined them soon after. 
Vaman Shivram Apte, the celebrated lexicographer had 
earned in his college career high repute as an accom- 
plished scholar and immediately on passing his M. A. 
examination had been engaged temporarily as Head 
Master in a Mission School. He tried his best to get a 
very good post in the Educational Departrfient. But 
such is the rigidity of red-tape, that he was offered the 
modest post of an assistant master in an Anglo-Verna- 
cular school. When the founders of the New English 
School heard this, they at once approached Mr. Apte 
and secured his services for the school as its Superin- 
tendent. The choice was most appropriate. Mr. Apte 
fully justified his selection for the post by the diligent 
and thorough manner in which he discharged his duties. 
He had in him the school-master's instinct, which 
taken at its best means a strict but temperate sense of 
discipline, patience with ignorance, system in exposition, 
attention to minute details and a readiness to plod un- 
wearied through the dull monotony of school-life. 

The Vernacular newspapers in Western India were, 
in those days mostly conducted by political dilettanti 
and self-seeking business-men. They therefore could not 
be expected to properly serve the cause of the public. 
The only important exceptions were The Indu-Prakash, 
the Dnyana-Prakash, the Native Opinion and the Subodh 
Patrika. These, out of the 77 newspapers conducted by 



22 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the " Natives " commanded some influence. At such a> 
time, therefore, the appearance of the Kesari (Marathi. 
weekly) and of the Mahratta (EngUsh weekly), with self- 
sacrificing and patriotic proprietors evoked the liveliest, 
appreciation in the mind of the public and considerable 
uneasiness in the mind of the Government. The appre- 
ciation of the public was shown by the rapid increase 
in the circulation of the Kesari — reaching nearly 4,35a 
within three years and the uneasiness of the Govern- 
ment stands mirrored in a remark in the Report {1882), 
on the Native Press which characterized the "prevailing 
tone " of the Kesari as '* unfriendly to the Govern-^ 
ment." This left-handed compliment conclusively 
proves that even in its infancy, the Kesari had distin- 
guished itself by its fearlessness. We do not however,, 
find the rigorous editorial discipline which we have 
learnt to associate with the name of Mr. Tilak. This 
was but natural. The proprietors were, one and all, 
very young and had yet to form sound views on many 
of the social and religious questions of the day. The 
editorial eloquence of Agarkar was still in its dawn ; 
the exuberant rhetorical style of Vishnushastri felt 
the limitations of a newspaper article ; nor do we any- 
where find the "parthian shots" of Mr. Tilak, his inci- 
sive logic and trenchant criticism. With all their- 
faults, the news-papers — especially the Kesari — supplied 
the wants of their readers and were everywhere 
praised with warmth and enthusiasm. 

As editor of the Mahratta, Mr. Tilak always cham- 
pioned the people's cause and in criticising the policy 
of high of&cials made no distinction between white 
and black Bureaucrats. He watched with the greatest 



THE FIRST ORDEAL 23 

solicitude the administration of Indian States, The 
affairs of Kolhapur in particular attracted his attention. 
Since 1870, the condition of Kolhapur was far from 
desirable. In that year died Rajaram Maharaj and in 
the year following his two widows adopted Prince 
Shivajirao. Though under good guardianship, the 
young Prince began to show, ever since 1877, signs of 
insanity and was often subject to delusions and suicidal 
tendencies. It was generally believed that this mental 
derangement was due to compulsory adminstration ol 
intoxicating drugs to the Prince. The author of this 
mischief was supposed to be Rao Bahadur Barve, 
State Karbhari, who, spurred by the Queen- 
Dowager Sakawarbai, wanted to remove the Maharaja 
from the Gadi either by death or by proof of his lunacy 
and to have a new youth adopted by the Dowager. 
People, high and low believed in these rumours, and 
on November 24th 1881, a monster meeting was held at 
Poona under the presidency of so distinguished and so 
moderate a gentleman as the late Hon. Rao Bahadur 
Gopalrao Hari Deshmukh. In this meeting, a reso- 
lution was passed, suggesting that the Prince should 
be immediately put under the guardianship of some 
trustworthy persons. Soon after this meeting was 
held, it was rumoured that an attempt was actually 
made on the life of the young Maharaja, and while 
the alarm caused by this rumour had not subsided, 
Tilak and Agarkar got three letters purporting to be 
\\Titten by the Karbhari. In these letters the plan of 
poisoning the Prince was plainly suggested ; and believ- 
ing that these letters were genuine, Tilak and Agarkar 
published them in the Mahratta and the Kesari and 



24 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

challenged the State Karbhari, if he dared, to prove 
his innocence befor(^ a court of law. 

Thus brought to bay, Rao Bahadur Barve had to 
accept the challenge with grim determination. He 
hauled up before the Bombay High Court Tilak and 
Agarkar and some of his enemies at Kolhapur. His 
contention was that his enemies at Kolhapur had 
formed themselves into a caucus and had determined 
to blaspheme him. His arch-opponent was one Nana 
Bhide who having been refused a pleader's Sanad, 
had sought to wreck his vengeance by machinations 
in and outside the State. A willing tool was found by 
Nana Bhide in the natural mother of the Prince who 
had a grievancs of her own against the Diwan. Find- 
ing themselves impotent to do mischief in the State, 
these persons had gone over to Poena, caught the ear 
of a credulous public and having approached the 
inexperienced editors of the Kesari and the Mahratta, 
secured an outlet for their fury. The letters, pur- 
porting to be his were mere fabrications made by 
Nana Bhide. He had never plotted against the life or 
the gadi of his master. The accusations made against 
him were wantonly wicked and he called for exemplary 
punishment of the offenders. 

The sympathies of an admii ing public centred round 
Tilak and Agarkar. They had championed the cause 
of the representative cf the historic dynasty of 
Shivaji the Great. They could gain nothing and had 
risked much for the peace and happiness of an unlucky 
Prince. They were defended by the combined ability 
and eloquence of Bombay's rising leaders — the 
fiery Mehta and the sweet-tempered Telang. 



THE FIRST ORDEAL 2$ 

The three letters, of course, formed the pivot of the 
case. Were they genuine ? The State Karbhari as- 
serted that they were not ; Nana Bhide till the last 
persisted in holding that they were. Who could throw 
light on the question ? Some witnesses from Kolhapur 
were expected to solve the riddle. But, though sum- 
moned they did no elect to appear. The High Court 
could not compel attendance ; for the witnesses were 
beyond its jurisdiction. Neither the Political Agent 
nor the Government of Bombay were willing to inter- 
fere as the case was a private one. The decision of 
the High Court went against Nana Bhide. The 
letters were pronounced to be unreliable. Tilak and 
Agarkar tendered a graceful apology. But the wrath 
of Barve was not to be so appeased. He pressed for 
conviction ; and Tilak and Agarkar, though declared 
"free from any suspicion of malvolence " were found 
guilty of having " thoughtlessly published defama- 
tory " articles and were sentenced (i6thjulyi882) each 
to four months* simple imprisonment. 

The decision of the High Court caused no surprise, 
for it was fully anticipated ; and so when Tilak and 
Agarkar were seated in a closed carriage and taken 
to the Dongri jail, they were rather proud of having 
been thus able to show their devotion to their country. 
Being inmates of the same cell, they could compare 
notes, review their conduct, weigh men and things, 
discuss future schemes and past mistakes. Such 
discussions were often carried far into the night 
and then the bugs and fleas of the dungeon were for- 
gotten ; not so the warders' reprimands for having 
broken the stillness of the night by their loud and at 



26 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

times heated conversation. In spite of such " lapses 'i 
Tilak and Agarkar were on the whole fairly " well 
behaved *' and got 21 days' remission for " good 
conduct." The disgusting nature of the gaol-diet 
told heavily on their health, Mr. Tilak losing as much 
as 24 lbs. in weight. But they never complained , 
Only one thing troubled them ; time hung heavily 
upon them and they even envied those of their fellow- 
prisoners who had been sentenced to rigorous impri- 
sonment. Wearied of inaction, they sent in an ap- 
plication to the General Superintendent of gaols for 
some sort of work and were glad to find that he was 
kind enough to place books and writing materials 
at their disposal. 

While Tilak and Agarkar were in gaol, a move- 
ment, headed by the late Principal Wordsworth 
and the late Hon. Mr. Mandlik was started to petition 
the Government to intervene and save these youths 
from the rigours of prison-life. The appeal fell on 
deaf ears. The Dinhandhtt very properly said " In- 
stead of applying to Government for the cancellation 
of the punishment, let us show our regard for the 
patriotic prisoners by giving them a right royal re- 
ception on their return." On October 26th 1882, 
Tilak and Agarkar walked out of the portals of 
Dongri, free men once more. Enthusiastic crowds 
awaited them outside. They were borne off in 
triumph. Addresses were presented; laudatory speeches^ 
wese made ; and the only reply our heroes could, 
make to all this overwhelming kindness was to declare 
that Prisons would never have any terrors for them 
and would never deter them from discharging 



THE FIRST ORDEAL 2/ 

bravely and sincerely their duties. Soon after, 
Agarkar ceased to be a politician and confined his 
attention only to Education and Social Reform. 
Mr. Tilak, however, was privileged frequently to 
enjoy the hospitality of His Majesty's gaols ; and un- 
broken in his resolution, he pursued till the end his 
self-chosen work of National uplift. 

We must not forget to mention that while the 
Defamation case was proceeding, Gopal Krishna 
Gokhale, then a mere college student acted a female 
part in a drama the proceeds of which were to go 
to the fund started to help Tilak and Agarkar. It is 
under these circumstances that Gokhale 's name 
has been first introduced to the public. Considering 
the future relations between Gokhale and TUak, who 
will not love to linger on the fragrant memory of this 
small but significant episode ? 



## THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 

We have undertaken this work of popular education with the 
firmest conviction and belief that, of all agents of human civili- 
sation, education is the only one that brings about materiali 
moral and religious regeneration of fallen countries and raises 
ihem up to the level of most advanced Nations by slow and 
peaceful revolutions : and in order that this should be so, it 
must be ultimately in the hands of the people themselves. 

From the Statement of V. S" Apte before the Hunter Com- 
mission (1882) 

"|Lf"AN*S outlook of the world is necessarily dependent 
"^^ upon his environments. Howsoever indomitable be 
the individual will, it fails not to realise its limitations and 
has to shape its course accordingly. Gifted though he 
was with extraordinary ability, superabundent enthu- 
siasm and magnificent courage, the only outlet Mr. 
Tilak found for his energies was the comparitively mo- 
dest field of education. He and his colleagues clearly re* 
alised the complete hold which the alien rulers had ob- 
tained over the length and breadth of this vast country. 
Howsoever much the British Imperialists might boast of 
India's conquest by the sword, it has been fully and 
freely admitted by Seely that in the willing acquiesence 
of Indians in the British Suzerainty alone lay the great- 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 2^ 

€St permancy of that rule ; and the Educational system 
introduced into this country by the new rulers sought to 
secure this acquiescence by capturing the will, the in- 
tellect and the imagination of the people. Educa- 
tion, thus is an instrument by means of which the Gov- 
ernment has sought to consoHdate its power and perpe- 
tuate its authority. In self-governing countries where 
the interests of the rulers and of the ruled are identical, 
the education that is imparted is necessarily of a highly 
ennobling kind. It kindles patriotism, refines senti- 
ments, strengthens moral sense and stimulates all the 
latent powers of the soul. But the education, which 
India has received during the last hundred years and 
more has been quite of a different nature. It has 
taught us to disbelieve our religion, disrespect our 
social order and even to disobey our parents. It has 
perverted our patriotism, has made materialistic our 
outlook of life and by causing us to neglect our ancient 
history and culture weakened our moral stamina and 
all but broken our national back-bone. But this is not 
all. The medium of the English language has put a 
crushing biurden on our students. Add to this the men- 
tal isolation of those, who were appointed to fix the 
curriculum and one can easily understand how the 
hobby-horses of various Directors and Senators have 
mined the youths of this country. Education, to be 
useful must be in the hands of the Nation's chosen 
leaders. Alien Bureaucrats and uns3mipathetic Mission 
aries have no right to shape our mental and moral equip- 
ment. They would, no doubt encourage the produc- 
tion of a class of well-trained clerks, obedient, loyal, 
■quiet, submissive and single-minded in the discharge o£ 



30 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

appointed duties. But they would try their best to 
discourage manUness, virihty and patriotism. 

If these statements are not now regarded as parado- 
xical the credit is due, among others to Mr. Tilak and 
his colleagues who started the New English School 
Poona, on January ist, 1880. On the opening day, 
only 19 students were enrolled. Within a couple of 
months the school stood fairly on its legs and by the 
end of the year the number rose to 336. By the end 
of 1881, it was above 600 and in January 1884, it stood 
at 858. The mangers of the school astonished the pub- 
lic by taking the very modest salary of Rs. 30 p. m. 
though every one of them was competent enough, in 
some other walk of life, to draw ten times as much. 
Dr. Hunter, President of the Education Commission was 
supremely satisfied with the wonderful spirit and solid 
improvements introduced by Mr. Tilak and others and 
has recorded (1882) his unreserved admiration in the 
following words : — 

" Throughout the whole of India, I have not yet wit- 
nessed a single institution which can be compared with 
this establishment. ^ * * This institution * * can 
rival and compete with success not only with the Gov- 
ernment High Schools in the country, but may favour- 
ably compare with the schools of other countries also." 

The question has been sometimes asked : ** How is it, 
that in his attempts to nationahse education, Mr. Tilak 
did not disdain to take Government grant ?" The 
answer is twofold. In the first place, Mr. Tilak did not 
surrender any of his principles in availing himself of the 
tax-payers* money through the Government. He did 
not bend his knees before the high-handed conduct of 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE. 3 1 

educational authorities*. He was not called upon to 
obey Risley Circulars. Secondly, the difference between 
the circumstances of those times and the environments 
of to-day ought to be taken into consideration. To-day, 
you must either submit to the whims or caprices of the 
educational authorities or sever your connection with 
them altogether. But in the early eighties Mr. Tilak 
started his career with the hope of inducing the Govern- 
ment to transfer the whole of secondary education {and 
College education, if possible) to popular control. He 
regarded the spread of education as a preparation for 
the national struggle. He saw that though the Bureau^ 
crats were not wiUing to entrust to the children of the 
soil an iota of real political or military power, still they 
could be persuaded to part with educational control if 
we were persistent and enterprising enough. They 
pretended to hold over political rights only because we 
were not sufficiently educated. If pressed to educate us 
quickly, they pleaded the wish but regretted the inabi- 
lity to do so on account of shortage of money. It was 
the ambition of Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to so 
cheapen, spread and improve education that the Govern- 
ment could not, without going back on their own words 
reasonably refuse the transfer of secondary and col- 

* In the critical days of 1897-8, the Deccan Education Society 
had the misfortune of incurring the displeasure of the Bureau- 
cracy and had to submit to arbitrary orders of the Government. 
This is not perhaps the only occassion when the Society felt 
constrained to consider discretion the better part of valour 
In justice, we may add that latterly, under the distinguished 
Principalship of the Hon. Mr. Paranjpye, the D. E. Society has 
shown admirable firmness on more than one occassion and has 
refused to act against its conscience, merely to please ofiScial 
vrhims. 



32 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

legiate education to the people. This will explain why 
he and his associates accepted such a low salary ; this 
also will explain why he accepted the Government 
grant. For some time, negotiations, informal no doubt, 
were actually going on regarding the transfer of the 
Deccan College to Mr. Tilak ai d his colleagues. But 
the reactionary element in the Government at last pre- 
vailed and Mr. Tilak's hopes were completely shattered. 

It is not to be supposed that the success achieved by 
the New English School in an incredibly short time was 
due to any accidental combination of favourable cir- 
cumstances. Far from this being the case, enormous 
difficulties met Mr. Tilak on every side. The vested 
interests that suffered raised a storm of abuse and mis- 
representation. The lack of public spirit made the 
work of collecting funds very difficult. Money came 
not in torrents but in dribblets. More formidable than 
the scarcity of money, was the difficulty of getting 
suitable men, willing to accept the work in true Jesuiti- 
cal spirit. The Kolhapur Defamation case, the sudden 
death of Chiploonkar, the incarceration of Tilak and 
Agarkar added to the difficulties. The patriotic fervour 
of Tilak, Agarkar and Chiploonkar greatly impressed 
even the green-eyed Times of India, which while recog- 
nising that the ambition of the founders of the New 
English School was legitimate, was somewhat afraid 
that this ambition was " destined to have momentous 
efiects on the future of India." 

Mr. Tilak was the soul of this devoted band. Modest 
and unassuming, he never loved lime-light. Though 
most of the work of organisation fell on his puissant 
shoulders still he never cared to figure as the Head. 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 33 

That honour he delegated to others. " I Hke to work *' 
he said " and never think of honours." 

In school, he taught Mathematics and sometimes 
English. His greatest difficulty was that he never found 
it easy to adopt his teaching to the capacity of his pupils. 
In this point Apte and Agarkar easily beat him. 

Another pecuharity which distinguished him from 
his colleagues was his supreme isolation from the lighter 
moods of his students. Generally the most popular 
teacher is he, who would occasionally find time to in- 
dulge in those digressions on current topics 
which are the delight of students. Apte, Agarkar, 
Gokhale, Bhanu and Gole, — all sometimes gave them- 
selves up to " fun and frohc." Mr. Tilak however was 
severely regardful of his lesson. Students could never 
draw him out. Indeed, the attempt even was never 
made by them. 

And yet he was, not perhaps the most popular, but 
certainly the most revered teacher. For him boys felt 
that mysterious regard which genius and greatness 
always evoke. 

With teachers of first-rate qualifications and capa- 
city like Tilak, Apte and Agarkar, it is no wonder that 
the results of the New English School at the Matricu- 
lation were exceedingly bright. The admiring citizens 
of Poona were proud of these young Uons and felt bound- 
less confidence in them. Indeed, the New English 
School began to be considered as the new centre of 
public life and inspiration in Maharashtra. The school 
of thought led by Ranade began to dwindle and its 
brightness paled before the lustre shed by the heroes of 
the New English School. No prophet was required to 
3 



34 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

foretell that before the avalanche of these activities 
Ranade's followers would be swept away. 

It is not necessary to go into the various improve- 
ments made in the system of education by the founders 
of the New English School. The utility and efhcacy of 
these improvements has been tested by time. Before 
1880, the distribution of History, Geography, Mathe- 
matics and Science over the different standards of 
schools was arbitrary, unsystematic and unsuited to 
young boys. Tilak, Apte and Agarkar made the neces- 
sary adjustment, which at that time provoked much 
comment. They also insisted on the vernacular being 
made the medium of instruction ; they discouraged the 
use of English as much as possible. Special attention 
was paid to the equipment which the students brought 
to the lowest English class and as this equipment was 
found to be very much below the normal — it is the 
same even now — a Vernacular school was started with 
the object of providing better intellectual material to 
the English school and every care was taken to make 
the instruction in the Vernacular school animated, more 
systematic and less rigid. An idea of the crude educa- 
tional methods of those times can be had from the fact 
that, when what is known as the "Subjects System/' 
was introduced in place of the old system, it 
was received in no friendly spirit and a storm of opposi- 
tion and criticism awaited an improvement which no 
man in his senses thinks of condemning now. 

It was impossible for Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to 
rest content with the establishment of a successful 
High School. Since the very foundation of the New 
English School, Mr. Tilak had cherished the ambition 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 35 

of starting a College. Besides, he believed that the 
establishment of a College would enable him to get 
from its alumni the right sort of men, properly imbued 
with the spirit of sacrifice and anxious like himself to 
cover the Presidency with a net-work of educational 
institutions. A preliminary meeting of the well-wishers 
of the New English School was held and on 24th Octo- 
ber 18S4 the Deccan Education Society was formed 
and an application to the University for permission to 
start an Arts College was made. It is needless to 
trace the slow developments of the College till 1890 
when Mr. Tilak after eleven years of hard work had 
to leave the Society. Suffice it to say, that most of the 
work of organisation, collection of funds etc. was done 
by him and Namjoshi. He was the guiding spirit of 
the institution and can claim a handsome share of 
the credit of having made it a success. 

As a professor, Mr. Tilak maintained an exceptionally 
high level. He was a specialist in Mathematics and 
Sanskrit ; and he was occasionally required to take 
Science also. His teaching was always thorough and 
satisfied the cleverest of students. It was marked by 
rapidity, profundity and originality which frequently 
was the despair of average students. 

The causes which compelled Mr. Tilak to sever his 
connection from the Society had their germs in the 
very initial stages of the progress of the New English 
School. They rapidly accumulated since 1885, result 
ing in greater and greater acrimony. It would have 
been better for the peace and harmony of the infant 
School and the infant College had more care and rigid- 
ity been observed with respect to the admission of new 



36 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

life-members, had the basic principles of the body been 
put down as articles of faith and had members joining 
the Society been required to observe them or withdraw 
from the body. As a result of this laxity, different tem- 
peraments could not harmoniously be blended by 
solemn obligations ; this want of harmony inevitably 
resulted in incompatibility of views, which, in its turn. 
Increased bitterness and finally brought about rupture- 
in 1890. Mr. Tilak and his associates started their 
career for the cheapening and facilitating of education. 
They placed before themselves the aim of establishing 
an Indian Educational Mission, forming a network of 
schools throughout Maharashtra on the Jesuitical idea of 
poverty and self-denial. In the discussions which Mr. 
Tilak had with Mr. Agarkar in 1879 this ideal was fuUy 
accepted. It was over and over repeated on each and 
every public occasion which they and their associates 
could get. It was repeated when Mr. Apte gave, on 
behalf of his colleagues, evidence before the Hunter 
Commission in 1882 ; it was repeated on the occasion 
of the visit to the institution of Sir James Fergusson, 
then Governor of Bombay (Feb. 1884). If Mr. Tilak's 
colleagues, later on found this oft-repeated pledge in- 
convenient, if by continuous and sometimes devious 
tactics they sought to temper its rigour, if regarding 
him as aknost an obstacle in the way they harassed 
him by magnifying his faults, questioning even his 
capacity, taxing him with self-assertion and self-glorifi- 
cation under the cloak of Divine disinterestedness and 
stoicism and by going to the length of passing a vote of 
censure upon him, surely it was no fault of Mr. Tilak 
that he felt himself obliged to resign. 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 37 

The first three years of the school were spent in the 
struggle of asserting its existence. When the school 
and the newspapers became accomplished facts, inspite 
of desertion, death, incarceration and disappointed ma- 
lice the next three years were spent in organizing the 
institutions. By the end of this period, the constitution 
of the D. E. Society was formed and the bye-laws of 
the managing board were passed on the model of the 
regulations of Missionary bodies. All life-members 
were to receive equal pay and had equal rights. As the 
monthly pay fixed was not very high, it was provided 
that under special circumstances gratuities might be 
granted in addition to monthly salaries. A further 
provision for accidents etc., was made by assuring the 
life of every member for Rs. 3,000 and Mr. Tilak who 
did the whole of this business thought that this arrange- 
ment would leave no motive for anybody to seek work 
outside the body and thus divert his energies in a 
different channel. 

When, however, the struggles and cares of estabHsh- 
ment and organisation were over, some members began 
to long for more and began to talk of the growing needs 
of their families. The cry was catching and when the 
lead was taken by some of the elders newly admitted 
members who had but a dim perception of why and 
how the principle of sacrifice was adopted naturally 
joined in it and every excuse was pleaded to discover a 
loophole and break through the original understanding. 
'■•J The first attempt in this direction was made in 1885. 
It sought to remove the inequahties of payment receiv- 
ed by members. In the beginning (18S0) some mem- 
bers had taken no payment while others were allowed 



38 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to draw more, even in after years in consideration of 
their special wants. It was proposed to remove these 
inequalities with effect from 1880, by making up the 
account of each life member since 1880, excluding the 
special gratuities in each case and the accounts were 
so adjusted as to make the sum drawn by each propor- 
tionate to the period of service. 

It was unfortunate that the conduct of the Kesari and 
Mahratta was combined with that of the School and the 
College. The financial position of the school improved 
earlier while the newspapers were not paying concerns 
at all. The writers did not get any profit from 
their work. As long as the whole body were working 
zealously for the joint concerns no difficulty arose. 
But when members began to count the market- 
value of their energy and ability, it so happened that 
while some ceased to write to the papers and devo- 
ted themselves to more paying pursuits, others had 
to devote the whole of their time to the Press without 
receiving anything. 

This brings us to the main question, " Whether or 
not a member of the Society could do some outside work 
for his private gain." In the initial stages of the school 
some members were paid extra gratuity for their 
special wants, because no member was to work in his 
private time for personal end. From 1885, however, 
the principle of equal pay and equal work began to be 
preached and it was urged that if any member had any 
special wants he should meet them by private work 
and that the duty of each and every member was to 
teach in the school for 4 hours and that, beyond that 
every individual was free to do what he liked. The 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 39 

result of this was that the membership of the D. E. 
Society began to be considered as a good start for a 
beginner in Poona and that if he had any energy and 
ambition, he could use it as a stepping stone for personal 
distinction. The scale of the salaries of the members of 
the Society was first increased to give them free time 
and energy to work for the common object and then 
the theory of four-hours' service v/as propagated to 
satisfy the financial ambitions of individual members, 
who priding themselves on the name of Indian Jesuits, 
were not willing to imitate the singleminded devotion 
of the European Jesuits. Mr. Tilak, therefore rightly 
insisted that either the outside work should be stopped 
or that, a rule should be made that the profits of the 
extra work should go to the common fund as in the case 
of Missionary Societies.* It was with this view that a 
resolution was passed, in February 1888, that if any 
special book was required for the school, it should be 
prepared by open competition and its copyright pur- 
chased by the Managing Board. The very first case, 
however that came for consideration, was decided on a 
contrary principle. Mr. Gokhale, who was given Arith- 

* Mr. Gokhale, who in these controversies had uniformly op- 
posed Mr. Tilak has himself framed the following rule for his 
Servants of India Society : — 

(Rule IX d) That he (a member of the Society) will be con- 
tent with such provision for himself and his family, if he has any, 
as the Society may be able to make. He will devote no part 
of his energies to earning money for himself. 

What Mr. Tilak insisted upon, in all the acrimonious contro- 
versies which his opponents in the D. E, Society thought fit to 
indulge in, was only this that a Life-Member of the Institution 
will devoie no part of his energies to earning money for himself. 



40 lOKAMANYA TILAK 

metics of Standard VII discovered that a suitable text- 
book was wanting and the Board resolved to make his 
book a text-book for 1889, before it was published. 

About this very time Mr. Gokhale, who had been for 
some time working for the Sarvajanik Sabha journal 
now thought of accepting the post of the Secretary of 
that association with 2 or 3 hours' regular work every 
day. Mr. Tilak objected to such a diversion of mem- 
bers' energies. He declared that it would be carrying 
the privilege of private work too far to allow members 
to contract such definite engagements outside the body. 
The Secretaryship had been offered to him before, but 
he had declined to accept it for the above reason. 

In February 1887, Mr. Agarkar found himself in 
money difficulties. Under ordinary circumstances, he 
should have put in an application for gratuity. But, 
while advocating members' right to earn extra money 
by doing extra work he had been chiefly instrumental 
in passing a resolution that the occasions for gratuities 
should be rare. He therefore brought before the Board 
a proposition to increase the monthly salary of all the 
life members. The only reason given for the proposed 
change was that the financial condition of the school 
permitted it. Mr. Tilak urged that if necessary to 
Mr. Agarkar, a gratuity might be given to him but the 
supposed prosperity of the finance was no ground for 
increasing salary, at least so long as the Society was 
not properly endowed. 

These and like discussions, frequently held, created a 
lot of irritation which left behind it a trail of bitterness 
and even rancour. Questions of general policy, of 
starting a Boarding House and a Technical school, of 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 4! 

accepting a European professor helped to widen the 
breach. Mr. Tilak steadfastly tried to remain loyal to 
the original ideals while others were equally determined 
to give way to circumstances. Finding the situation 
hopeless, Mr. Tilak took leave (June 1889) for one term 
with the object of ultimately withdrawing from the 
body. A compromise was then effected on the ques- 
tion of outside work, salaries and internal relations and 
then Mr. Tilak rejoined the school. But like previous 
arrangements, this too proved nothing more than a 
paper arrangement. So for the peace and harmony 
of the institution he loved most, Mr. Tilak, after a very 
painful struggle severed his connection from the D. E. 
Society (Dec. 1890). 

When Mr. Tilak has detailed these reasons in his 
memorable resignation, when the records of the D. E. 
Society bear witness to the incessant struggles between 
his lofty idealism and the continued efforts of some of 
his colleagues to improve their financial position at the 
cost of the great principle of self-sacrifice, is it not rather 
strange that those v/ho, though not eye-witnesses to the 
events culminating in Mr. Tilak's resignation have at 
least ready access to the documents of the Society, 
should have come forward to anyhow discredit Mr. 
Tilak in the eyes of the general public ? The Hon. Mr. 
Paranjpye, in one of his gratuitous attacks on Mr. Tilak 
has attempted to discover the causes of Mr. Tilak's dis- 
agreement with his colleagues. But he has not a word 
to say about the sordid considerations and disputes 
which disfigured the Society's Proceedings Book for a 
number of years. All these controversies he conveni- 
ently ignores and rushes to his own pet theories which. 



42 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

unsupported by evidence and having no foundation in 
facts should never have been propounded. According 
to Mr. Paranjpye, Mr. Tilak had two unpardonable 
faults. He never learned the simple lesson that two 
persons could differ on some points while agreeing on 
many others ; and worse still, Mr. Tilak was such a 
masterful personality that he could never work with an 
equal. The inevitable consequence followed. Mr. Tilak, 
unable to tolerate differences of opinions in his col- 
leagues became more and more overbearing in his deal- 
ings with them ; and jealousy completed the breach thus 
created by intolerance. 

Is there any shred of truth in these accusations ? 
Have they been supported by any evidence, real or 
imaginary ? The answer is no. That Mr. Tilak held 
strong views on many important problems of the day is 
well-known ; but that differences in opinions created 
the breach in the D. E. Society has yet to be established; 
and that Mr. Tilak allowed these differences so to over- 
power him as to influence his conduct with those in- 
terested in the work of the Society is indeed a large 
assumption. Why, we can enunciate just the contrary 
proposition and undertake to prove it from manifold in- 
stances on record. Unlike Messrs Apte and Agarkar — 
his principal opponents in the Society — Mr. Tilak was 
essentially a man of action ; and being a man of action 
he never hesitated to co-operate even with his oppon- 
ents. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occasion 
to crosss words with Dr. Bhandarkar; but in the picket- 
ing campaign of 1908, Dr. Bhandarkar was his friend 
and ally. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occa- 
sions to condemn the public conduct of Dr. Bhatavdekar; 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 43 

but in the astronomical conferences held in Maharashtra 
to improve the old calenders, Dr. Bhatavadkar was 
alwaj^s by his side. In the plague of 1897, Mr. Tilak 
co-operated even with the Government. In the famous 
Home Rule agitation, he joined hands with Mrs. Besant. 
There have been occasions when Mr. Tilak has co- 
operated with Mr. Paranjp3'e himself. If Mr. Tilak 
could co-operate with the missionaries, with the Govern- 
ment, with persons of the type of Dr. Bhandarkar, Dr. 
Bhatavadekar, Mrs. Besant and Mr. Paranjpye, surely 
the charge of intolerance falls to the ground and 
cannot by any stretch of logic or rhetoric be sustained 
against one, who of all others was chiefly instrumental 
in securing for the D. E. Society the patronage of 
Ranade, Bhandarkar, Telang, Mandlik, Wordsworth 
and many others. 

Mr. Tilak jealous ! Mr. TUak unable to work with 

his equals Mr. Tilak, who during eleven years of his 

life in the D. E. Society never once cared to accept the 
post of a Principal, Head-Master or Superintendent ! 
And prey, jealous of whom ? Not of Ranade or Telang 
— his intellectual peers ; but of Apte, Agarkar and 
Gokhale ! ! " Mr. Tilak saw soon after Gokhale's ad- 
mission to the society that here was a man likely to be 
his formidable rival." Mr. Paranjpye is here speaking 
of the Gokhale, not of 1905 or 1908, no, not even of 
1897 ; the Gokhale of 1885 or 1887 was, according to 
his own biographers, regarded by his own friends and 
Mr. Tilak's opponents as nothing better than a clever 
college student. Apte was a Sanskritist and nothing 
more ; Mr. Tilak's versatile genius could beat Apte on 
his own ground. As regards Agarkar, his title to fame 



44 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

rests more on his great sacrifice, his championship ot 
every kind of reform and his eloquent style, rather 
than on his genius and learning. In point of intellec- 
tual equipment, Mr. Tilak far surpassed all his collea- 
gues ; and if there was any jealousy at work, it must 
have been rather in the minds of those who, accustom- 
ed to regard Mr. Tilak as an equal ever since the 
college days, could not now bear with equanimity his 
enormous superiority. 

Whether Mr. Tilak should have so much valued the 
principle of self-sacrifice as to endanger unity and good- 
will might leave room for difference of opinion. But 
from the foregoing account it must be abundantly clear 
that, not jealousy or intolerance but the great principle 
of self-sacrifice on which Mr. Tilak would brook no 
compromise was responsible for Mr. Tilak's separation 
from his colleagues. The incident, however deplorable 
or painful brought happy results ; for the loss of the 
D. E. Society was the gain of India. One need never 
lament the day — howsoever unpleasant the circumstan- 
ces attending the event — when Mr. Tilak decided to give 
that to this country which he had so unselfishly and 
ungrudgingly given to the school and the college. Our 
only regret is that he did not leave the D. E. Society a 
few years earlier.

rilHE stagnant condition of the Indian civilisation 
during several centuries has given rise to a number 
of social evils which by their very accumulation impres- 
sed the imagination of the first generation of EngHsh- 
educated Indians. But these evils are neither more pres- 
sing nor more hideous than those which during the last 
three centuries have accompanied the rapid growth of 
European power and culture. The first duty of every 
country is to strengthen its position and consolidate its 
influence amidst neighbouring groups of nations with 
a view to safe-guard its political liberty which is the 
mother of all social well-being. Where this hberty is 
wanting, the duty of the people lies in recovering it 



46 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

from those into whose hands it has fallen. But the 
Indian leaders in the first half of the 19th century 
failed to take note of this cardinal principle and the 
country, instead of pining for its lost independence 
was applauding the English as deliverers. Howsoever 
natural such an attitude might have been owing to 
the chaotic condition of things just before the 
British Conquest it cannot be too much deplored. 
For, relieved of the cares and responsibilities of 
political and international questions, the new leaders 
of the country attended to the next best thing, 
the condition of their society. In this attitude 
they were encouraged by their English and Anglo- 
Indian masters as well as by the zealous Mission- 
aries, who, too had an axe of their own to grind. Add 
to this the tendency of a fallen nation to be-little its 
own worth and admire the customs, manners, thoughts 
and institutions of the rulers. Knowing that they were 
a mere handful in the midst of crores of Indians, the 
English believed that unless they maintained very high 
prestige among Indians the Political domination of 
India was an impossibility and hence they appeared to 
us at their best, — strong, masterful, gifted with all the 
qualities of greatness. They were demigods amidst a 
race of mortals, giants ruling over pigmies and the very 
limited intercourse Indians could have with them com- 
pletely concealed from us their shortcomings. It is not 
surprising that in the psychological situation detailed 
above, Indian leaders, cut off from the moorings of 
National traditions mistook the unreal for the real, the 
accidental accompaniment for the substance. Cons- 
cious of their own impotence and anxious to lift up the 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 47 

country to a high level they could think of only one 
way, the complete Westernisation of India. English 
dress, English habits, even English diet and English 
life must, they thought, be imported into this country 
before we could think of replacing the English Bureau- 
crats. Ladies must learn, widows must remarry, castes 
must go, — all because we must be equal to our rulers in 
efficiency and strength. These early English-educated 
leaders advocated Social Reform with the same 
object with which Japan, nearly seventy years back 
threw away her crude military weapons in favour 
of the modern instruments of destruction. In short, 
love of imitation, loss of individuality, the glamour 
of the English civilisation and a fierce desire to get 
rid of India's inferiority, joined with the liberalising 
tendencies of the Western thought, ushered the era 
of Social Reform in India. 

As years passed by, the wildness of these reformers 
somewhat abated. But the central idea that possessed 
them was faithfully transmitted to the next genration. 
Even Ranade was obessed with the idea of getting, so 
to speak a certificate from the rulers about the equal 
social status of the Indians. In all the social programme 
he has left us, we do not come accross a single item 
wherein he has departed from the English model. The 
idea that the English were Heaven-sent trustees of this 
country dominated Indian thought in his days also and 
it was believed that once the English had to concede 
that Indians had socially advanced up to their level 
political rights could not, with decency, be refused. It 
was Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, who gave a rude shock 
to this blind optimism and declared that if Indian 



48 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Society was to grow, it could only develop on its own 
lines. His scathing criticism of the degenerate Social 
Reformers of the day created a new epoch of social and 
political thought and during all his eventful career, 
Mr. Tilak did not much depart from the lines laid down 
by his master. Mr. Tilak was essentially a Puritan of 
Puritans and so was in a sense more fitted to lead Social 
Reform than many of the so-called Reformers ; but 
being more a man of action than of thought he prefer- 
red to concentrate on the political issue. 

** Was Mr. Tilak a Social Reformer "? The question 
can be correctly answered only by knowing which re- 
forms he approved of and which ' reforms ' he con- 
demned. He favoured foreign travel but insisted on 
teetotalism and vegetarian diet. He applauded re- 
marriages of child-widows ; but laid stress on the proper 
performance of the Vedic rites. He was for female edu- 
cation but wanted it to be both useful and ornamental. 
He tolerated inter-dining but only on occasions of neces- 
sity. He wanted sub-castes to intermarry before he 
could favour the larger question of intercaste marriages. 
He advocated adult marriages but disliked the predo- 
minantly materialistic nature of Western marriages. 
He wanted the badge of untouchability to be removed 
but would be no party to hasty and fanatical measures 
that would only retard the improvement of the social 
life of the ' depressed ' classes. He was for a policy oi 
open door to all classes and creeds. Drink he abhored, 
also sexual vice. He wished our reformers to actively 
combat these evils by strenuous propaganda. Reform 
he wanted, but genuine reform and not apish imita- 
tion of Western life and manners. 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REtCRM 49 

His ideal of a Social Reformer was a Buddha, a Kabir 
or a Tukaram. The leader of the Social Reform move- 
ment must essentially be a man of peace. He must be 
a lover of Indian civilisation and culture and must pro- 
ceed to reform society with due respect for the tradi- 
tions of the society itself. He must not only be of our 
society but must live in it. He must be bold enough 
to break those bonds that have outlived their utility ; 
but at the same time he must be calm enough 
not to harm his cause by abusive language. He 
must be a " stalwart Puritan man, battling for the 
right, trustful but not elated, serious but not de- 
jected." He should make his way through mis- 
understandings, opposition and persecution by sheer 
force of truth, love and courage. 

But the Social Reform movement of Mr. Tilak's 
youthful days did not conform to this ideal. It was 
essentially a child of the Western civilisation ; it had 
its origin in callous disregard of the past. It ignored 
the study of the fundamental basis of Indian Society. 
It was not discriminating. It was largely imitative. 
It sought to copy Western life and institutions. The 
leaders were weak, halting and inconsistent ; the fol- 
lowers had nothing in them but sound and fury. Sus- 
tained enthusiasm and sterling sacrifice were woefully 
at a discount. It was a movement which claimed, 
first priority to and later on equal status with the poli- 
tical movement and sought radically to reconstruct our 
society without taking note of the traditions of the 
past or the insufficient materials available in the pre- 
sent. Such an artificial and indiscriminating move- 
ment, launched by a handful of fanatics simultaneously 
4 



50 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

with the National Congress excited Mr. Tilak's liveliest 
opposition ; and for a few years he was engaged in rele- 
gating the movement to its normal plane and not allow- 
ing it to usurp the chief attention of the country. 

Ever since 1S34, the ' irrepressible and audacious * 
Mr. Malbari had been trying to raise the age of marriage 
of Hindu girls. The field of his activity covered not 
only the length and breadth of India but the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain also, whence he brought con- 
siderable pressure to bear on the then Viceroy and his 
Council to consider his proposals some of which were as 
follows : — 

(i) Cohabitation by a husband with his wife, under 
twelve years of age, should be made penal. 

(2) In cases of infant-marriages, the wife should be 

entitled to cancel the marriage, if she liked, on 
attaining majority. 

(3) Suits by husbands for the restitution of conju- 

gal rights should not be allowed. , 

(4) A widow should continue to hold her first hus- 

band's property even after her remarriage. 
These and other proposals struck at the very root of 
Hindu Society and nullified at one stroke the sanctity 
and indissoiubiUty of the marriage-tie. They, there- 
fore caused intense alarm ; and when it was known 
that a Bill to raise the " Age of Consent " from 
10 (Vide Sec. 375 of the Indian Penal Code) to 12 
was in contemplation not only the orthodox people 
but some of those who were pronounced Social 
Reformers resented this legislative interference. It 
was generally believed, though without reason and 
in spite of the Government's assurance to the 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM $1 

contrary, that the introduction of this Bill was 
only the thin end of the wedge and that the 
whole of Mr. Malabari's programme was likely to re- 
ceive legislative sanction. Mr. Tilak's opposition to 
this Bill has been severely criticised. We should re- 
member, however, that amongst those who diaspproved 
of this Bill, can be seen the names of the late Sir Romesh 
Chander Mitter, the late Mr. W. C. Banerjea, the late 
Sir T. Madhavarao, Babu (now Hoa. Sir) Surendranath 
Banerjea, Mr. (Hon. Dr. Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad 
and Mr. (now Hon. Mr.) G. S. Khaparde. Mr. Tilak's 
attitude was guided by strong common sense. He 
challenged the right of a foreign Bureaucracy to sit in 
legislative judgment on the Indian society. He denied 
the necessity of the measure and the extent of the evil 
which he was sure would be eradicated by increasing 
education. He led a vigorous agitation, which there 
is reason to believe convinced the Government of the 
day of the unwisdom of its step ; the fetish of prestige, 
however steeled the Governments' determination to 
get the BiU passed (19th March 189 1). The Govern- 
ment even preferred* "to be wrong with Prof. Bhan- 
darkar, Mr. Justice Telang and Dewan Bahdur Raghu- 
nath Rao, than to be right with Pandit Sasadhar and 
Prof. Tilak." The impression which Mr. Tilak made, in 
those eventful months marked him out as the ** coming 
man". The merciless logic and the vast knowledge 
with which he exposed the fallacies and sophistries of 
the Reformers in his " long and scholarly " letters 
to the Times of India were universally admired and 
the extent to which he succeeded in organising

public opinion enabled him to pass a resolution 
in the Bombay Provincial Conference (May 1891) 
regretting that the Government did not properly 
respect the public opinion on the "Age of Consent 
Bill." It is worth noting that the leaders of the 
Keform Party who were present at the Conference 
dared not oppose the resolution moved by Mr. Tilak. 
Mr. Tilak was not merely a destructive critic. He 
showed the way in which the Bill could be made accept- 
able to the Orthodox party. He suggested that the 
attainment of puberty should be made the legal age for 
the consummation of marriage. Had this compromise 
been accepted there would have been no trouble. But 
neither the Governm.ent nor the leading Reformers 
were in a conciliatory mood. Mr. Tilak about this 
time (26th October 1890) put forth one suggestion which 
shows the sincerity of his faith in genuine social reform. 
He disapproved of general legislation as the masses 
were not prepared for the same. But he welcomed 
resort to legislation as a binding force to those who be- 
lieved in reforms. His proposals were as follows : — 
(i) & (2) Girls and boys should not be married until 

they have reached the age of 16 and 2a 

respectively. 
(3) & (4) Unless they are prepared to marry 

v/idows, men should not marry after they 

are 40 years old. 

(5) There should be absolute prohibition of liquor. 

(6) Acceptance of dowry in marriages should be 

prohibited. 

(7) Disfigurement of widows should be forthwith 

stopped. 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 53 

(8) One-tenth of the monthly income of every re- 
former should be devoted to public purposes. 
Neither Ranade nor Agarkar were willing to bind 
themselves with this pledge. However, on Nov. ist 
1890, a meeting was held under the presidency of the 
late Hon. Rao Bahadur Nulkar to consider Mr. Tilak s 
proposals. At this meeting where both Mr. Ranade and 
Prof. (Dr. Sir) Bhandarkar were present, Mr. Tilak de- 
livered a speech which deserves to be recorded. He 
said — " There has been much tall talk but little action 
regarding social reform, with the result that even those 
reforms, the vital need of which has been generally ad- 
mitted have not been carried out into practice. We 
must not only see what reforms are required, but also 
whether and how far they are practicable and how 
they can be made popular ; for in reforming society, 
care ought to be taken to avoid the creation of any 
gulf between the people on the one hand and the refor- 
mers on the other. We must always carry public opi- 
nion with us ; and this can be done, inter alia, by secur- 
ing for our reforms the sanction of religion. I am in 
favour of Social Reform." He then discussed his 8 
points and wound up by saying that modifications 
might here and there be made in his scheme and then 
the whole be made binding on its supporters by calling 
in legislative sanction. Legislation, he urged should 
bind the reformers only and not the masses. Mr. 
Ranade welcomed Mr. Tilak's speech but expressed his 
doubt as to how many people would come forward to 
bind themselves legally to carry out the reforms 
proposed in the 8 points. He said that there 
were 4 classes of social reformers (i) Those who look to 



54 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

religious leaders for support, (2) Those who wanted ta 
avail themselves of caste-unions, (3) Those who were 
willing to accept legislation for themselves and (4) 
Those w*ho wanted legislation applicable to all. He 
concluded by saying that as Mr. Tilak had fairly ad- 
vanced up to the third stage, there was very little- 
difference between himself and Mr. Tilak. 

What, then, was the difference between the school of 
thought represented by Mr. Ranade and that represent- 
ed by Mr. Tilak ? For difference — vital difference — 
there was, in spite of Mr. Ranade's attempt to 
emphasise the points of agreement. The difference 
was this that while Ranade was prepared, if con- 
venient, to coquette with religious sanction to 
social reform, Mr. Tilak insisted that there should 
be no divorce between the two. The former wanted 
to utilise, for the propagation of his ideas, the 
disintegrating forces that had come in the 
wake of the English conquest ; the latter while 
emphatically not unfriendly to social reform, believed 
in the imperative necessity of checking, from the larger 
national standpoint, the disintegrating forces by fos^ 
tering a due sense of pride in and respect for the social 
and religious institutions of the people. The former 
depended solely on Western influence and thought; 
Mr. Tilak was for the blending of the old culture and the 
new. The former welcomed State-interference in mat- 
ters social, the latter strongly resented it for the simple 
reason that reform to be durable must be a growth from 
within. Differing thus in their outlook, it is not sur- 
prising that while Ranade was prepared to associate 
and work with wild and reckless people, people who^ 



TILAK AMD SOCIAL REFORM 55 

were the very negation of qualities required for the Social 
Reformer— gentleness, patience, tact, forbearance, and 
sweetness, Mr. Tilak was gradually convinced of the 
futility of sccial reform as it was then propagated 
and was for the above reason compelled to adopt 
first an attitude of constructive opposition and then 
of neutrality. No ' petti-fogging motives of policy/ 
no consideration of winning cheap popularity by 
' pandering to public prejudices ' determined his atti- 
tude. 

Looking back at the controversy from a distance of 
30 years, what, after all has been the net result of this 
much-debated measure ? Under the combined influ- 
ence of increasing education and economic conditions 
and not certainly as a result of the passing of the Bill, 
the age of marriage has gone up, making the law practi- 
cally a dead letter. Only bitter feelings have been 
created, feelings which have widened the gulf be- 
tween the Orthodox and the Reformers and frus- 
trated Mr. Tilak's attempts to bring about a 
social Reform that would not run counter to the reli- 
gious and patriotic susceptibilities of the people. It 
is with pain that one recalls the rowdy scenes that 
unfortunately marred a meeting convened by the 
Reformers at the Kreeda Bhuwan (25th Feb. 1891). 
These scenes, it is still more regrettable to observe, so 
enraged a venerable and learned Reformer that he 
telegraphed to the Times of India insinuating that 
Messrs. Tilak and Namjoshi were at the bottom of the 
mischief. Subsequently a notice was served upon the 
Times of India (2nd Mar. 189 1) and the Reformers 
ceased to persist in the insinuation. They, however 



56 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

prosecuted five persons for rioting, all of whom were 
acquitted by the Magistrate. (23rd Mar. 1891). 

While the ashes of the * Age of Consent ' controversy 
were still hot, another episode, still less important 
widened the breach between Mr. Tilak and the Refor- 
mers. Mrs. Ramabai — that enterprising Indian Chris- 
tian lady — had, by her untiring efforts in America, col- 
lected funds for the establishment of a Resident School 
for Indian girls, especially widows. Mr. Tilak, did not 
at all approve of the idea of a school for Indian girls 
managed by a Christian lady ; but knowing full well 
that the Reformers could not command the necessary 
sacrifice and organising capacity, he reluctantly enrolled 
his name among the sympathisers of the institution, 
after satisfying himself that only secular education 
would be imparted in the school. When, however, he 
read in the Illustrated Christian Weekly of New York 
(21st Dec. 1889) ^^^^ there were about four students 
in the school studying Christianity or attending Chris- 
tian prayers in a Church, he indignantly asked what 
became of Mrs. Ramabai's pledge that the school 
would strictly remain secular in its character. 
Mrs. Ramabai protested and explained the circum- 
stances under which her four students were receiving 
Christian training. The Advisory Committee consist- 
ing of men like Mr. Ranade and Dr. Bhandarkar 
took Mrs. Ramabai to task and asked her to 
confine herself to secular education. Mrs. Ramabai 
had to yield for a time. But she soon 
threw overboard the Advisory Committee by 
managing to secure for herself plenary powers from the 
Head Office in America. This was the moment when 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 57 

the advisory Committee ought to have spoken out its 
mind in unmistakable terms and withdrawn, by means 
of resignation its moral support from the institution. 
But the members wanted to outwit Mrs. Ramabai and 
get a reversal of their decision from the American Head 
Office ; this was an impossibility, as the Head Office had 
implicit trust in Mrs. Ramabai and it was supplying 
funds to her mainly for the propagation of Christianity. 
Mr. Ranade and his followers had therefore to play a 
game of dissimulation ; for they knew that once the 
public faith in Mrs. Ramabai was shattered, nothing 
could rehabilitate it. It was here that they had a 
tussle with Mr. Tilak. From the middle of 1891 to the 
close of 1893, this was one of the burning topics of the 
day. The taunting and violent way in which papers 
like the Subodh Patrika and Agarkar's Sudharak fell foul 
of Mr. Tilak is the more remarkable when we remember 
how they must have realised their double game. Why 
should they all have clung up to Mrs. Ramabai, so un- 
reasonably, so fanatically ? Could they not have 
started an institution of their own, under some trust- 
worthy management ? Did they think that female 
education, even attended with grave risks of conver- 
sion to Christianity was so necessary ? Apparently 
they did not, for on Aug. 13th, 1893, they publicly dis- 
owned all connection with the institution because it was 
^'conducted as an avowedly proselytizing institution"*. 
They admitted that " during the past year or so, Pandita 
Ramabai departed from the lines of strict neutrality "; 
In trying, therefore to screen Pandita Ramabai from the

tion, located at Kedgaon near Poona. 



58 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

righteous indignation of the public, they succeeded in 
making (he cause of reform more unpopular and the 
breach between the Orthodox and the Reform parties 
still wider. 

The same fateful year (1890) which witnessed the 
origin of the Age of Consent controversy and the 
SJiarada-Sadana episode was marked by the com- 
mencement of a dispute still more ridiculous — a 
veritable storm in a tea cup. The responsibihty of 
this dispute rests not with the Reformers but with 
the Orthodox party at Foona, the fanatical and 
foolish self-stj'led leaders of which charged 42 
persons including Ranade, Tilak and Gokhale with 
having taken tea (Oct. 4th 1S90), at the residence of a 
Missionary with the deliberate object of breaking caste 
and in the following two years (1891-92) this suit of 
the Orthodox party against these 42 gentlemen in the 
Court of Shree Shankaracharya was the principle sub- 
ject of heated public controversy. The Reformers con- 
gratulated themselves on having an ally in Mr. Trlak 
whose resourceful Sanskrit scholarship stood them in 
good stead and helped them in getting very light punish- 
ment from the religious tribunal. It is noteworthy that 
Ranade thought it in no way humiliating to submit to 
the decision of the Court and for this conduct he was 
severely criticised by both the Orthodox and the Re- 
form parties (the latter included some of his own ardent 
followers). Mr. Tilak justified the taking of Pray ash- 
chitia, and said that in such matters it is the duty of us 
all to be actuated by a spirit of compromise. He said 
** There is considerable resemblance between our diffi- 
culties in the Political field and those in the Social one J 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 59 

neither the political asdministration nor the structure 
of our society completely satisfies us. We want to 
reform both. The English administration as well as 
the Indian society have solid foundations; we are, there- 
fore, bound to proceed with caution. Now, if people 
are willing to accept Political Reforms in a spirit of 
conciliation and compromise we fail to understand why 
we should like to proceed with Social Reform in an 
arrogant and defiant manner. If we are prepared to 
make compromise when the Parliament passes the 
Council's Act, 1892, why should we not do so with res- 
pect to questions likes widow-remarriage ? Fanatical 
opposition might occassionally be successful, but as a 
rule, in political as well as social matters, fanaticism is 
suicidal " {Kesari 7th June 1892). 

It will be news to this generation, accustomed to take 
for granted Mr. Tilak's hostility or indifference to Social 
Reform, that not only did he attend Social Confer- 
ences but also took active part in the proceedings. In 
the 4th Social Conference, held at Calcutta, (Dec. 1890), 
Mr. Tilak moved an amendment to a Resolution pro- 
posed by the late Mr. R. N, Mudholkar. The resolu- 
tion condemned child-marriages and advocated adult- 
marriages. Mr. Tilak, who whole-heartedly supported 
the proposition wanted to delete an incorrect reference 
to the Shastras. In the Social Conference of 1891, held 
at Nagpur, Mr. Tilak suggested a bold amendment to 
the Resolution which advocated widow remarriages and 
called upon people to help the movement by doing their 
utmost. "How are the people to help "? asked Mr. 
Tilak. He said that mere lip-sympathy for widow 
remarriages would not do. These who sympathised 



-60 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

with the cause ought to show their sympathy by attend- 
ing not only the marriage-ceremony but the marriage 
feasts also. But the diplomatic leaders of the Confer- 
ence, the professions of some of whom considerably 
differed from practice, wriggled themselves out of the 
difficulty, by adding the words " so far as possible " to 
" help the movement ." To the resolution advocating 
sea- voyage, Mr. Tilak moved an amendment which laid 
stress upon vegetarian diet and Prayaschitta. He was 
supported by Pandit Mad an Mohan Malaviya. 

In 1889, the Social Reform leaders issued a circular 
together with printed copies of pledges which persons 
who believed in Social Reform had to sign. The cir- 
cular expressly declared that the idea of resort to legis- 
lation, in matters social, was definitely given up. So 
Mr. Tilak gladly associated himself with this movement 
led by Ranade and other leading Reformers of the 
Bombay Presidency. But when the Government, 
showed their willingness to introduce the " Age of 
Consent Bill ", the leaders of Social Reform did not 
hesitate to go back on their pledged word. The Social 
Conference of 1889 decided — altogether without con- 
sulting the signatories to the pledge — that the pledge 
bound not themselves alone but their children and exe- 
cutors as well ! ! ! Mr. Tilak was utterly disgusted 
with such ridiculous resolutions. He admitted that the 
disfigurement of widow was unjustifiable but he had 
nothing but contempt and ridicule for those who seri- 
ously brought forward a resolution in the Conference 
requesting Government to make penal the disfigure- 
ment of widows. Such childish, perverse and un- 
reasonable conduct was in his opinion extremely 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM. 6r 

prejudical fo the cause itself. The greatest defect 
in the movement was, Mr. Tilak declared, want of 
courage and wand of sincerity. There was much 
empty noise. Nothing could be gained, he thought, 
by holding National Social Conferences. There 
was no country in the world, which resorted 
to such general condemnation of its customs and 
manners. Moreover, there are so many different 
castes and creeds in India that, excepting a very 
few common points, each section of the community 
must proceed in its own way along the path of 
reform. x\ll reform is a growth from within and 
unless the people are sufficiently prepared by due 
assimilation of liberal ideas if is useless to march 
ahead. It was no use running the Social Conference 
on the lines of the National Congress. The latter 
was a deliberative assembly and could not be 
otherwise in the present circumstances. But it devolved 
upon the Reformers to appeal more to the people than 
to the Government. Action and not mere speech was 
the need of the day. A vigorous educative propaganda 
must be carried on. We must proceed step by step 
along the lines of least resistance ; and above aU the 
Reformers must in no way hurt the general pride of the 
people in their Social life and institutions. In the 
atmosphere of political serfdom, there are countless 
things that make us conscious of our weakness. What 
we want is self-confidence ; and all reform that tends 
to make the nation more conscious of its shortcomings 
than of its strength, is not only undesirable but is posi- 
tively mischievous. 

It will thus be seen there was something more than 



62 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

mere Opportunism behind Mr. Tilak's attitude towards 
Social Reform nearly 30 years ago. It has been said 
that since his return from Mandalay he showed a broad- 
er outlook and he did not hesitate to assimilate " the 
more Catholic tendencies " of the time. But a careful 
perusal of the preceding pages will show that, even in 
his younger days, Mr. Tiiak was a Social Reformer. 
His declaration of sympathy with the depressed classes, 
made on the eve of his departure to England was much 
appreciated. Here again Mr. Tilak's ideas about the 
best v/ay of effecting reform prevented him from sign- 
ing the manifesto which pledged the signatories to take 
every opportunity of breaking the bonds of untoucha- 
bility. Mr. Tilak was no believer in violent Social 
Reform. Regarding the Patel-marriage-Bill, though 
he was in favour of some such legislation, he 
believed the Bill to be untimely and against the basic 
principles of the Hindu religion and society. Had he 
lived for a decade more, the country would have seen 
him playing the role of an active Social Legislator in 
the new Councils. In his youth, parasitical Social 
Reform was blended with lukewarm political spirit. 
Mr. Tilak gave a rub to both and became, in spite of an 
unpleasant episode the leader of the Orthodox Party 
in social as well as political matters. He lived, how- 
ever to claim amongst his followers, persons of all castes 
and creeds, the Orthodox and the Reformers. The 
silent force of modern conditions has wrought a mighty 
revolution in the Social ideas of the people in spite of 
the fact that there has been no propaganda worth the 
name. All have moved with it ; Tilak and Chanda- 
varkar, the bigots of the Orthodox Party and the fire- 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM. 63 

eaters amongst Social Reformers. To-day's Social 
Reformer speaks quite a different language from that 
of Ranade and others. And the venerable Shastris 
and Pandits of the present time sanction things that 
would have shocked their own susceptibilities a gene- 
ration ago. The evolution of Mr. Tilak's religious 
views, so bold and original — lies recorded in the pages 
of the Gita-Rahasya ; but the cruel hand of death has 
for ever prevented us from having an actual knowledge 
of the evolution of his ideas about the Hindu Society 
and the ways and means he had devised for its improve- 
ment. ' Ditcher ' in the Capital (7th August 1920) 
remarks most thoughtfully; — 

" There were epochs of thought in his personal bio- 
graphy ; and I think that in the zenith of his power, the 
fervour of his Hindu particularism began to cool and 
blend with the more CathoUc tendencies of his time and 
conutry." 



## TILAK AND THE CONGRESS— I 

At the Poona Congress of 1895, when Gokhale wasa secretary 
of the Reception Committee, the ridiculous controversy started 
by Mr. Tilak, about letting the Social Conference have the use 
of the Congrss Mandap assumed disproportionate dimensions 
and Mj. Tilak triumphed momentarily. I do not know what 
he now (191 5) thinks in his heart of hearts of the part, that he 
played in the matter, though he can, like the skilful advocate 
that he is, still put a fair complexion on it is necessary. 

R. P. Paranjpye 

nPHESE words, coming from the pen of a responsible 
Moderate leader show to what length party misunder- 
standings and party misrepresentations can go. To a 
certain type of people, Mr. Tilak has always appeared as 
the evil genius of the Congress, creating trouble, foment- 
ing dissensions, recklessly courting Government wrath 
and leading the nation to the verge of disaster. They 
sum up Mr. Tilak's contribution to the Congress cause 
by mentioning the controversies at the Poona Congress 
and the fiasco at Surat. Only history will show how 
Mr. Tilak popularised the Congress movement during its 
infancy, how for that purpose his co-operation was 
sought, though his person was disliked, how he tried to 
infuse fresh blood into that body when the original 
* firebrands ' were degenerating into apathy, how he 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 65 

failed, how matters culminated in the unfortu- 
nate spUt at Surat, how the Congress dwindled 
into nothingness, and how Mr. Tilak's return (1916) 
to the Congress camp enhanced its prestige, power 
and popularity, until at last in the present moment 
it has been recognised as the non-of&cial ParUament 
of the country. 

Mr. Tilak joined the Congress in 1889, — only after his 
separation from the Deccan Education Society had be- 
come ine\'itable and imminent. " One thing at a time '* 
was always his motto. If he sacrificed Social Reform 
to Politics, let us not forget that in the first 
ten years of his career he sacrificed Politics to 
Education. The principle of division of labour, in- 
troduced mainly by Mr. Tilak into our public Hfe 
has at last been accepted and no man is now 
blamed for confining his attention to a particular 
branch of national acti\dties. 

The question is often asked " WTiy was not Mr. Tilak's 
name even proposed for the Presidentship of the Con- 
gress earlier ?" His genius, learning, courage and sacri- 
fices were generally admitted. What then came in his 
way ? If Mr. Tilak was a junior, was not Mr. (Now 
Dr. Sir) Chandavarkar equally so in 1900 ? The answer 
is that the group of the politicians who held the Congress 
in leading strings was rather exclusive and would not 
agree to admit into the inner sanctuary an element of an 
alien type. The qualities that then were considered to 
belong to a statesman were eloquence of speech, supp e- 
ness of conduct, European habits and association (mis- 
named influence) with the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak had 
none of these ' rare ' gifts. He possessed in a boundless 
5 



66 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

measure the ''too coommon** qualities, — fixity of pur- 
pose, inflexibility of will, boundless courage and enthu- 
siasm, lofty idealism and tremendous earnestness. In 
the midst of holiday poUticians claiming monopoly of 
wisdom and statesmanship, he was an impracticable 
enthusiast, to be tolerated as an unavoidable evil. His 
superabundant energies were fully utilized and six suc- 
cessive Provincial Conferences (all of them, except two 
held at Poona) were organised by him and by Mr. 
Namjoshi. But in the agenda of resolutions only a 
back seat was given to him and he was very rarely given 
the opportunity of moving important resolutions in the 
Congress. Mr. Tilak who cared more for work than 
for honour and display cheerfully did the part of 
the work entrusted to him. If the credit of popu- 
larising the Congress work in Maharashtra can be 
claimed by any one, it can be by Mr. Tilak. The 
Congress itself was an institution after western models ; 
its"; leaders, so far at least as the land of the Marathas 
was concerned, were chiefly Government servants 
and pensioners, titled nonentities and self-seeking 
youngsters. Add to this; the controversies in con- 
nection with the Age of Consent BiU, Sharada Sadan 
and . the Hindu-Mahomedan riots, controversies in 
which Mr. Tilak had to take a definitely hostile atti- 
tude towards the Reformers of the day. StUl, at the 
call of the Congress, he threw aside his opposition to 
those people, and year in and year out, appealed to the 
general public to follow its lead aud strengthen it by 
moral, intellectual and financial support. Had Mr. 
Tilak been the narrow-minded bigot he was represented 
to be he would never have supported the Congress Pro- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 67 

paganda, headed that it was by most of tlie reformers 
and risked his popularity with the masses by 
championing a body which utilised his energy and 
abiUty but which showed very httle recognition of his 
ivorth. All these circumstances must carefully be 
remembered if we would correctty understand the tangle 
of the Poona Congress (1895). 

The real question before the Poona pubUc of 1895 was 
not whether the Social Conference of that year should, 
according to the usual practice have been allowed to 
be held in the Congress Mandap; for had this been the 
real question at issue " the ridiculous controversy " 
said to have been " started by Mr. Tilak " would at 
once have been settled by Mr. Ranade's graceful and 
timely declaration that the Social Conference, which in 
truth was attended only by a small fraction of the 
Congress delegates and visitors would be held in some 
other place. When there is a childish dispute over a 
trifle, all the parties concerned are responsible, if it 
assumes " disproportionate dimensions." The question 
of holding or not holding the Social Conference in the 
Congress Pavilion was only a move in the bigger game, 
the deep-laid plot, of discrediting Mr. Tilak and humilia- 
ting him in the eyes of the Poona pubhc and of the 
Congress at large. Nobody will say that the petty 
motives of jealousy which moved lesser men inspired 
leaders like Ranade. It will, however have to be 
admitted that had Ranade risen to the full height which 
the occasion demanded much heart-burning would have 
been avoided. But he was powerless to assert his will 
against the clique that surrounded him. It was humour- 
ously called " The Tilak Persecution Society." 



68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Looked at, from an impersonal standpoint, the differ- 
ences between Tilak and Ranade have been summarized 
by the former as follows : — 

" Every one*, whether orthodox or heterodox, refor- 
mer or reactionary should join in and support the 
Congress movement. A Congress in Poona cannot be 
regarded a success unless the majority of the people in 
Poona join it enthusiastically. We must approach the 
trader, the artizan and the working man as well as 
the educated classes and make all of them subscribe 
to the Congress fund and in order to do this 
we must appeal to each of them in a manner, so 
as not to offend their susceptibilities unnecessarily. 
The Congress eventually aims at being a Con- 
gress of the people and the object cannot be 
achieved, unless, every year, an effort is made to 
approach more and more the classes that have not 
taken hitherto much interest in the movement. * =^' * 
If the masses are drawn to the Congress, it is possible 
that they may not lend their support directly or indirect- 
ly to the cause of the Social Conference. It is this 
apprehension that makes the friends of Social Reform 
restrict the scope of their work for the Congress within 
a safe narrow circle. ^ ^ One (party) wishes to draw 
to the Congress as large a portion of the public as it 
possibly can, irrespective of the question of Social 
Reform : the other does not wish to go much beyond the 
circle of the frionds of reform. '^ * * The real point of 
issue is whether ''' '-' the Congress in Poona is to be a 
Congress of the people or of a particular section of it.

* * If the friends of Social Reform are not willing 
to respect public opinion, which I regret to say, some of 
them are prepared to characterise as brute force — I for 
one am not * * prepared to make a split in the Congress 
camp by persisting in claiming a recognition of the views 
of the majority of the public ^ ^ ," 

When the work of the Congress was to be commenced, 
the Reformers were in a great glee, as, happening to 
command a majority in the Standing Congress Commit- 
tee, they expected to carry things in their own way. 
But Mr. Tilak soon made it clear to them that he would 
be no party to such a manifestly unjust arrangement. 
They, therefore had to set up a working Committee 
consisting of an equal number of members belonging to 
both the parties. How to neutralise this " concession " 
was a question which seriously occupied some mischie- 
vous spirits of the Reform Party and they hit upon a 
very ingenious trick by means of which they hoped 
either to place Mr. Tilak in an awkward situation or to 
create a split in his party, which would give numerical 
superiority to the Reformers in the Working Committee. 
They stirred up the fury of the ultra-orthodox section 
of the people by constantly boasting that the Social 
Conference, so disliked by the majority — would be held 
in the Congress pavilion in the teeth of their opposition. 
The result was that Sardar Balasaheb Natu, with others 
belonging to the extreme wing of the Orthodox Party 
issued a circular, demanding that the Social Conference 
should not be held in the Congress Mandap. Thus a 
split was created in the Orthodox Camp. 

Regarding the relations of the Social Conference witk 
the National Congress, a contemporary paper wrote as 



70 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

follows : — " At the Calcutta Congress (1886) that shrewd 
and experienced old Parsee, Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji, the 
President dwelt upon the subject both in his opening 
speech and during the discussion ; and decided against 
the Congress having anything to do with Social Reform, 
directly or indirectly. 

" But the hot-headed reformers, threw the words of 
the old Parsi patriot, and the sense of the Calcutta 
Congress to the winds. At Madras they tried their game 
next year and with the assistance of a few addle-pated 
Madrasee reformers succeeded in obtaining their wish ; 
and after the Congress, was held within its pandals the 
first Social Conference. * * 

Since 1887 to 1894, the Social Conference has held its 
sittings as the tail of the Congress."* 

So much for wisdom ; now let us see how fanaticism 
bred fanaticism. When the controversies over the Age 
of Consent Bill were at their height, the late Mr. Hume^, 
" father " of the Indian National Congress declared 
that he would sever his connection from the Congress if 
he found the majority of the leading Congressmen op- 
posed to the BiU. This unreasonable and overbearing 
conduct naturaUy excited many Congressmen and it 
was said that if acquiescence in hasty and mischievous 
measures of Social Reform was to be the price of the 
support of Mr. Hume to India's political demands — 
well, Indians could afford to do without him. Such 
reckless language naturally made people suspicious and 
as early as 189 1 many people expressed a desire 
that the Social Conference should not be held in 



* The Hope (Calcutta). 



TiLAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 7 1 

the Congress pavilion. If responsible leaders like Hume 
could give vent to such thoughtless remarks, can we 
blame Sardar Balasaheb Natu for having given such an 
undue importance to the site of the Social Conference ? 
Mr. Tilak's attitude regarding the dispute about the 
Social Conference was perfectly reasonable. As early 
as July 23rd, 1895, he openly declared in the Kesari that 
those who made the holding or not holding of the Social 
Conference in the Congress Mandap the condition of 
their financial support to the Congress were not the 
friends of the Congress. He proposed that the dispute 
should be decided by the Congress itself or by the Re- 
ception Committee. A better solution of this question 
could not be imagined and yet the cry was kept up that 
Mr. Tilak was supporting the extreme wing of the ortho- 
dox party headed by Sardar Natu ! A side-Hght 

• 

on the sincerity of this cry is thrown by the fact 
that som^e of the Reformers (e.g. Kashinathpant Natu, 
Keshavrao Patvardhan) refused to contribute to the 
Congress fund unless positively assured that the Social 
Conference would be held in the Congress pavihon. 

Another cry in the same game of anyhow discrediting 
Mr. Tilak was that his attention to the Congress work 
was perfunctory. People were " shocked " to find that 
the pavilion was not ready in September. Mr. Tilak 
reminded them it could be done only after the rainy 
season was over. " Wliat about chairs " said they. 
Mr. Tilak told them that though the chairs bore the 
brand of " AustraUan chairs " stiU they could always be 
had in Bombay at a week's notice. " And the volun- 
teers "? Well, the volunteers were not required before 
the middle of December ; still, written complaints were 



72 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

made to the Working Committee. Mr. Tilak had 
secured the site, prepared plans and estimates, sent 
round men and letters for subscription, actually collect- 
ed some money. For all this and other work, he 
was praised by Mr. C. Vijayaraghavachariar who ex- 
pressed his surprise that Poona should have com- 
menced work in right earnest so early. And yet the 
reformers of the Working Committee wanted to sit 
in judgment upon Mr. Tilak. Mr. Tilak showed 
how they themselves had shirked work and had 
thrown all the burden upon him. He produced 
the report of the Working Committee of the preceding 
year's (1894) Congress at Madras and challenged his 
opponents to compare that work with his. Discom- 
fitted, the reformers had to submit to passing a 
resolution expressing their satisfaction at Mr. Tilak 's 
work. 

Discomfiture, however did not bring repentance. 
Taking advantage of Mr. Tilak's temporary absence 
from Poona, they made attempts to remove the Congress 
Office from his residence. The Sub-Committees were 
swamped with reformers and instead of adhering to the 
original resolution, fixing one vote for every gentleman 
who paid Rs. 50 and upwards, it was decided (Oct. 18) 
that those who paid upwards of Rs. 50 were entitled to 
vote not only on their own behalf but separately for 
heir wives and children ! A more ridiculous resolu- 
tion cannot be imagined and this the reformers could 
"'arry through only on account of the split in the Ortho- 
*^ox party. And yet Mr. Tilak was supposed to have 
^een in league with Sardar Natu ! 

Mr. Tilak exposed all these tactics in a circular letter 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 73 

to all the leading Congressmen and Associations in the 
mofussil. He also exposed them at a public meeting 
held at Poona on October 22nd. As the Reformers' 
majority in the Committee had usurped all the func- 
tions, it was resolved at this meeting that a new Recep- 
tion Committee on an equitable basis should be formed. 
The Reformers considered this meeting to be nothing 
more than a display of " brute force " and hence 
appealed to the Standing Committee to settle the dis- 
pute. The Standing Committee decided that both the 
parties should be represented by two Secretaries each, 
that Bombay should contribute three Secretaries and 
that this Committee of seven should carry on all the 
Congress work. Great pressure was brought to bear 
upon Mr. Tilak to accept this arrangement ; and when 
at last Mr. Tilak did consent to it he quickly found that 
it was all imaginary and that the status quo was main- 
tained by the Reformers. Disgusted beyond measure 
by all these tactics, Mr. Tilak took the only course left 
to him and resigned his secretaryship on Nov. 4th. 

The Reformers were delighted ; and 3^et they felt 
unhappy. They felt as uncomfortable and suspicious 
as Macbeth when he had got rid of Banquo. What if 
Mr. Tilak made a row ? Police aid was sought and got 
because " the attitude of a section of the Hindu Com- 
munity in Poona is hostile to the Congress." The re- 
peated advice which Mr. Tilak gave to the public, 
appealing to them to stand by the Congress, failed to 
diminish this feverish anxiety. "Suppose, the Mandap is 
set on fire by Mr. Tilak's emissaries. WTiat would be- 
come of the Congress?" These foolish fears haunted 
them like a nightmare. Still, with dogged and malig- 



74 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

nant obstinacy they continued their activities against 
Mr. Tilak, chiefly through a newspaper subsidized by 
the Reception Committee. There is no knowing how 
the unpleasantness of the situation would have been 
aggravated had not the Hon'ble Mr. Surendranath 
Banerjea, President-elect of the Congress, himself a 
staunch Social Reformer, set matters right. He re- 
quested Mr. Ranade not to press the question of the 
Social Conference. He even threw out broad hints that 
if the disputes at Poona could not be amicably settled 
he would refuse to preside. This courageous and states- 
manlike conduct compelled Mr. Ranade to be reasonable 
and to make a belated declaration that he would not 
try to hold the Social Conference in the Congress pavi- 
lion. Had he made the declaration earlier and on his 
own initiative, his reputation for statesmanship would 
have been redeemed ; but his declaration made practi- 
cally under compulsion, together with the continuance 
by his minions of their disingenuous tactics kept the 
situation almost unchanged. The offer of co-operation, 
repeatedly made by Mr. Tilak was spumed. The Reform- 
ers, conscious of their own unpopularity were afraid 
to bear the light of the day. And yet a public meeting 
to elect Poona delegates was to be held. Bowing to 
the inevitable, they convened a public meeting (20th 
December). The hall selected for the purpose was very 
small and the announcement of the meeting was made 
very late, presumably to outwit Mr. Tilak' s partisans. 
But long before the time of the meeting the opponents 
of the Reformers, alert as ever had packed the hall. 
With a clever manoeuvre they elected their own pre- 
sident. This perplexed the Reformers and as a mark 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 75 

of protest, some 15 gentlemen including Prof. Gokhale 
left the meeting. 

In spite of the worst fears of the reformers, the Con- 
gress was a brilliant success. The reception accorded to 
the Thunderer of Bengal was simply grand. Enthu- 
siasm was catching. After the Congress was over 
Sardar Baba Maharaj, a friend of Mr. Tilak was ' at 
Home ' to the Congress President and the Congress 
delegates. Then the party was led to attend a huge 
meeting in connection with the Shivaji Memorial. Mr. 
Banerjea made a thrilling speech and exhorted the^ 
|)eople to join the Shivaji festival inaugurated by 
Mr. Tilak. 

It is so very unpleasant to rake up from the forgot- 
ten past an episode of discord. But when we find 
attempts made to discredit Mr. Tilak for imaginary sins 
it is necessary to apportion the blame and decide where 
truth and fairness lay. Had Mr. Tialk's critics content- 
ed themselves with asserting that he disapproved of the 
holding of the Social Conference on the lines on which 
it was held, nobody would have cared to criticise such 
remarks for the simple reason that even leading Refor- 
mers of those days lil^e the late Hon. Rao Bahadur 
Nulkar thought pretty much in the same way. Mr. 
Tilak's supposed opposition to the Reform movement 
or to the Social Conference had absolutely nothing to 
do with the insignificant question of the holding of the 
Social Conference in the Congress pavilion. If this 
petty question assumed " disproportionate dimensions," 
the responsibility lies rather on those who, not caring 
for the fair name of their city were wiUing to vent their 
spite upon the devoted head of Mr. Tilak and discredit 



^6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

him in the eyes of his educated countrymen. The 
attempt partially succeeded. For though outside the 
Bombay Presidency, these disputes failed create any 
impression still in Maharashtra the estrangement be- 
tween the Reformers and the Orthodox party became 
complete ; and what is more important, the Bombay 
leaders who had taken very little part in the Social 
questions of the day were considerably influenced by 
the controversies owing to their association with the 
Reformers at Poona. Here then was sown the seed of 
that misunderstanding between the Lion of Bombay 
and the Lion of Poona, which unfortunately was des- 
tined to bear fruit at Surat in 1907. And all this could 
have been avoided by a single tactful and timely move 
on the part of Ranade. 

In conclusion, we may note one or two incidents in 
the life of the Congress which have a direct bearing on 
the present narrative. We have already seen that in 
the 2nd Congress at Calcutta, the Grand Old Man of 
India, keenly aware of the danger of mixing up Social 
Reform with Politics, declared the former as lying out- 
side the scope of the Congress. Not that he did not 
favour Social Reform, but he was particular about 
the unity of Congressmen. The third Congress under 
the Presidency of the late Mr. Badruddin Tyabji 
did not pass a resolution in favour of Cow protection, 
simply to conciliate Mahomedan opinion, in spite 
of the fact that the President himself and aU 
the delegates were in favour of protecting cows. 
If then the third Congress could leave out one 
important resolution — a question of principle — for 
the sake of unity, could not Ranade have tried 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 'JJ 

to secure unity by not pressing the Pandal quesr- 
tion ? Evidently, therefore party feeling got the better 
of patriotism. The smooth working of the Reception 
Committee at the Calcutta Congress of 1806 was 
endangered by bitter quarrels between the Bi ahmoes 
and the Orthodox party and a breach over religious 
questions seemed imminent. Here too, the principle 
ot keeping the Congress aloof from Social and 
religious controversies was forgotten. At the Madras 
Congress of 1894, some Purists of the Social Re- 
form party v/anted to boycott certain delegates whose 
morals had become the subject of much public dis- 
cussion and their extravagance was checked by the 
judicious and tactful conduct of the President who 
pointed out that though Gladstone was unwilling to nego- 
tiate with Pamell as the leader of the Irish Nationalists, 
still he had no objection to allow Pamell to work in the 
interests of Irelanl. It will thus be seen that the 
Poona disputes in 1895, did not form an isolated episode 
in the history of the Congress. A political organisa- 
tion that allows its cohesion to be endangered on side- 
issues betrays its own interests and plays into the hands 
of the common opponent. Viewed from this stand- 
point, the ridiculous controversies over the pandal 
question at Poona appear not merely impradent but 
positively suicidil, irrespective of the responsibility of 
this party or that ; and a careful perusal of t\\2 prece- 
ding pages will convince the reader that Mr. Tilak's con- 
tribution to these controversies was entirely involun- 
tary. 



## THE HONOURABLE AND I 

An Additional Membership is, as I view it,no sop or gag in- 
tended to stop honest and fair criticism. But if it is, I should 
certainly give it up rather than consent to draw the curtain over 
the gross negligence or the palpable errors of ofi&cials, however 
high they may be. 

B. G. Tilak 

f\^ August 7th, 1895, Mr. Tilak, elected by an over" 
^^ whelming majority by the District Local Boards 
of the Central Division, took, in the Legislative 
Council, the customary oath of allegiance to Her Ma- 
jesty, the Queen-Empress. Two years later he was 
standing as an under-trial prisoner in the High Court 
of Judicature, to be punished of disaffection, in spite 
of his protests and in anticipation of a new interpre- 
tation of the term ! The first event did not ensnare 
him, nor was his Hfe-work paralysed by the second. 

During the course of these two years, the Council 
met for 8 ' long ' days and worked for less than 36 
hours. As usual pertinent interpellations were asked 
to which pertinent or impertinent answers were re- 
turned. The discussion on the financial statement 
occupied much time. And the residue was devoted 
to the following questions : — 

I. The Bombay Civil Courts Act, 1869 Amendment 
Bill. 



THE HONOURABLE AND 1 79 

2. The Rules for conducting the business of the 
Council. 

3. A Bill to amend the Karachi Port Trust Act, 1886 

(withdrawn). 

4. A Bill to amend the Bombay Boiler Inspection 
Act, 1891. 

5. A Bill to amend the Bombay General Clauses Act, 

1886. 

6. A Bill to amend Act VIII of 1870 (an act for the 
prevention of the murder of female infants). 

7. A Bill to further amend the City of Bombay 

Municipal Act, 1888. 
A barren epoch, to be sure ! Under the regime of 
the Morley-Minto Reforms, members could at least 
spread, peacock-like, the glorious plumage of their 
knowledge and oratory. They could at least show off 
their grasp of economic problems and administrative 
details and could count upon moral effect of their 
work, — moral effect, not certainly upon the Bureau- 
cracy but upon their countrymen. But in the Coun- 
cils established under the Act of 1892, neither actual 
nor moral effect was possible. Amendments, here and 
there, of the Government Bills and a desultory discus- 
sion on the Budget, after " it had ceased to be a Bud- 
get " and " had been sanctioned by the Government 
of India " — that was all that could be done. Even 
the Bureaucracy confessed that the " examination of 
the contents of the Budget was little better than a 
post-mortem dissection "; and though Mr. Tilak re- 
torted by pointing out that " we could as well dissect 
a living as a dead Budget," stiU he had to submit to 
the inevitable. Under the flow of smooth and cour- 



80 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

teous words, the representatives of the Bureaucracy 
hardly failed to be sarcastic and overbearing. Mem- 
bers like the Hon. Mr. Sayani, who read carefully pre- 
pared manuscript speeches were " respectfully " re- 
quested to save their " physical labour " of reading 
them, by submitting to the Council printed copies^ 
which " might then be taken as read." The Hon. 
Messrs. Javerilal and Setalwad were blamed for turn- 
ing the Council into a " Circus," in which annually they 
were " wont to trot out their hobby horses." With 
such limitation and environments, it was natural that 
the output of the work of the representatives of the 
people was dis-appointingly small. Equally with his 
University fellowship* or the Municipal Councillorship, 
Mr. Tilak's membership of the Legislative Council failed 
to add one inch to his worth or one grain to his use- 
fulness. It was simply a trifling accident of his life. 

In several respects, Mr. Tilak possessed many of the 
qualities that go to make a great legislator. He had 
in him that unique combination of the idealist and the 
realist which is the sine qua non of a successful law- 
giver. His grasp of general principles, his mastery 
over petty and intricate details, his patience in investi- 
gation, his breadth of vision, his legal acumen, ready 
wit and resourceful intellect — all these qualities would 
have taken his name down to posterity as the maker of 

* In January 1894, Mr. Tilak was elected a fellow of th® 
Bombay University. In May 1895, he headed the poll at the 
genarai elections to the Poona City Municipality. He resigned 
his msmjers'lip of the City Municipality in 1897. After his 
convictijn {iS)j) he was deprived of his University fellov, ship 
by the Government of Bombay 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 8l 

salutary laws. But like Sir Pherozeshah, he too was 
destined to play the role of a mere critic of the ad- 
ministration. 

In spite of the limitations imposed upon his usefulness, 
Mr. Tilak worked in the Council with his usual ardour. 
Conscious though he was that all his criticism would 
very little affect the actual working of the admi- 
nistration, he wanted to put the whole Bureaucratic 
machine under his intellectual microscope. He was 
not content, therefore, with copies of the Financial 
Statement and of the Budget but called for the Advo- 
cate-General's Budget Notes. But the officials did not 
consider it worth their while to grant his request. Ap- 
parently they thought that the Budget which formed 
*' a printed document of close upon 200 pages " and the 
financial statement which fitted " a pamphlet of 
fair dimensions and touched on every head, whe- 
ther of revenue or expenditure," ought to satisfy 
Mr. Tilak. 

The originality of his genius showed itself in the 
Council. Not satisfied like other speakers with merely 
comparing the year's (1895-96) Budget with the Revised 
Estimates of 1894-95 and the Actuals of 1893-94, he 
proceeded to consider it in a true scientific spirit by 
examining " how far the revenue has increased during 
the last 25 years and what portion of it has been devoted 
to the material development of the Province." This 
led to the conclusion that " the revenue of the Presi- 
dency has increased by about 5| crores of rupees during 
the last 25 years. Land, Forest, Abkari have all been 
made yield as much as possible even to the inconve- 
nience of the people i and yet out of the revenues so 
6 



82 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

realised only a small portion has been devoted to the 
material improvements of the Province.*' ^ 

Mr. Tilak was not afraid to beard the Hon in his own 
den. Referring to the cess on Ahkari revenue, recently 
commuted, he asked whether " Government by an Exe- 
cutive act can repeal an Act of the Legislature." It 
was impossible for the Government members to dis- 
lodge him from his positions, nor did they dare hurl at 
him their arrows of ridicule or banter. Unlike many 
members of the Council, he was extremely sparing of 
compHments to the Official Members. He never gave 
praise, he never sought it. His speeches were severely 
impersonal and unrhetorical, studded with facts, mas- 
terly handled. What struck his hearers was the breadth 
and originality of his view-point and the facility with 
which he strode through the intricacies of statistics. 
The success of his speeches lay in the luminous way in 
which he used figures without quoting them frequently. 
This was the case with his writings also. 

Mr. Tilak 's short connection with the Legislative 
Council came to an end in 1897, when he resigned his 
seat, (after the criminal prosecution for sedition had been 
launched against him.) Among his colleagues in the 
Council, were the Hon. (Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad, the 
late Sir P. M. Mehta and the late Mr. Daji Abaji Khare. 

The year 1896-97 deserves to be recorded in shining 
letters of gold in the life of Mr. Tilak, because it brings 
out in bold relief that quality of his heart, which, though 
it forms the basis of his character, is generally over- 
looked by superficial observers, dazzled by his militant 
personaUty — we mean his genuine philanthrophy. 
Great as was the intellect of Mr. Tilak, his heart was 



THE HONOURABLE AND I 83 

greater still. The terrible famine and distress of 1877 
moved him as nothing else did and was, as we have seen 
mainly responsible for fixing the course of his life. The 
outbreak of famine and the irruption of the plague in 
this year (1896-97) shocked him and he knew no rest 
while labouring for the suffering thousands. Those 
who saw him at work during this eventful period 
recognised how his very soul was on fire. 

In ordinary times and under normal circumstances 
popular aid and co-operation on occassions of famine or 
epidemics are welcome to Government. But in the 
peculiar circumstances of India, such co-operation is 
sometimes discouraged by the Bureaucrats who con- 
sider the masses as their own property and would keep 
them from the * evil ' influence of the educated classes. 
When terrible famine broke out in 1896, Mr. Tilak 
was the centre of all popular activities directed towards 
the mitigation of every kind of suffering. Lord 
Elgin, the then Viceroy was busy with his round of 
visits to Indian States, the lesser European Officials 
were indifferent and apathetic and the Indian Officers 
like the Mamlatdars were, as usual, more desirous of 
collecting the revenue anyhow and of being patted on 
the back by their superiors, than of doing their duty by 
the poor ryots. The Missionaries had their own axe to 
grind. The public opinion in England was in the be- 
ginning ignorant of the terrible state of things. Later 
on, it was roused enough and some help to the famine- 
stricken was offered. But the Indian Government was 
at first rather unwilling to accept it. 

Mr. Tilak's programme included 4 items, (i) He sent 
round the presidency his lieutenants to collect informa- 



84 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

tion regarding famine conditions. His obect was to 
check the inacuracies of the reports submitted by Mam- 
latdars to their superiors. (2) These heutenants dis- 
cussed measures of rehef with local leaders, with a view 
to formulate constructive suggestions to Government. 
The Government had no doubt the guidance of the 
Famine Relief Code ; but evidently Mr. Tilak had greater 
faith in local bodies and leaders. The next two items 
concerned the people more directly. (3) It usually 
happened that most of the villagers, ignorant of the 
concessions promised by the Relief Code, sold away 
their lands or cattle to pay off the Government dues ; 
Mr. Tilak's * emissaries ', therefore, acquainted the 
people with their rights, explained the relevant sections 
of the Relief Code and distributed leaflets or pamphlets 
containing abstracts of the important sections of the 
Relief Code. (4) Having thus educated the people in 
the knowledge of their rights, they asked them not to 
be cowards and not to pay the Government dues at the 
cost of their lives or property. It will be seen that the 
agitation imparted the necessary knowledge to the peo- 
ple and exhorted them to show manliness ; and by con- 
structive suggestions it compelled the Government to 
insist on accuracy of reports and strict enforcement of 
rules. Week after week, the Kesari devoted all its 
columns to the discussion of the situation ; " Will you " 
Mr. Tilak passionately asked, "when the Queen desires 
that none should die, when the Governor declares that all 
should 1 ve and the Secretary of State is prepared to go 
in for debt, if necessary — will you kill yourself by timi- 
dity and starvation ? If you have money to pay Govern- 
ment dues, pay them by all means. But if you have 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 85 

not, will you sell your things away only to avoid the 
supposed wrath of subordinate Government officers ? 
Can you not be bold, even when in the grip of death ?*' 
This terrible unmanliness shocked him most. " We 
can stand any number of famines," he said " but what 
shall we do, with sheepish people ?" " Had such a 
famine broken out in England and had the Prime 
Minister been as apathetic as is Lord Elgin, his Govern- 
ment would have, in less than a week, tumbled down 
like ninepins." He deplored and condemned food- 
riots. " Why loot the Bazars ", he used to say " go 
to the Collector and tell him to give you work and food. 
That is his duty." 

Really speaking the Government ought He have 
hailed the vigorous co-operation of Mr. Tilak. He was 
making useful and constructive suggestions to them, 
through the memorials of the Sarvajanik Sabha and the 
columns of the Kesari and the Mahratta. But it was 
evident that the heaven-born Bureaucrats disliked the 
splendid growth of organisation under Mr. Tilak 's in- 
spiring guidance, because the * new spirit ' meant in- 
convenience to them. They found the plastic clay 
hardening into rock. The people were firm, not mili- 
tant ; law abiding, not aggressive, still the authorities 
deemed it necessary to put down the New Spirit. 

The first attempt in this direction was made at a 
village Khattalwad (Dec. 13, 1896) where Prof. Sathe, of 
the Maharashtra College, Poona, specially sent by Mr. 
Tilak for propaganda work, had the unique honour and 
opportunity of delivering a lecture in the presence of 
the Assistant Collector and a posse of soldiers. This 
evidently was an attempt to reduce the morale of the 



86 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

people and to cow down the lecturer. But the attempt 
failed and Prof. Sathe made a spirited lecture in spite of 
the intimidation conveyed by the presence of an armed 
force. Prof. Sathe was tried at Alibag for abetting 
several Forest and Abkari offences. The prosecution 
failed. It was soon followed by another. This time 
the victims were three gentlemen of Thana, who had 
done public service by issuing a leaflet in which provi- 
sions of the Famine Code were explained. This pro- 
secution too was a fiasco. In the next prosecution, a 
Mr. Apte was convicted and sentenced to simple impri- 
sonment for one year ; and soon after, the Sarvajanik 
Sabha which had led the agitation for the mitigation of 
the suffering caused by the famine was, on some flimsy 
pretext, declared to have forfeited its right to petition, 
tke Government. 

Of all the agitations led by Mr. Tilak, this one was 
the most systematic and organised. It was an agita- 
tion which all men understood, which allowed very 
little room for party squabbles, and which the Govern- 
ment was afraid to put down. Combining the strength 
of simplicity and unity and suffering from little opposition^ 
it became irresistible. It opened a new vista before 
Mr. Tilak. He saw immense possibilities in such well- 
organised agitations ; and he wanted the Congress to 
undertake an agitation, that would reach even the most 
distant hamlet. Upto this time, Mr. Tilak was satis- 
fied with — or rather he acquiesced in — the methods of 
Congrss leaders. But now he wanted a radical change. 
Referring to the proceedings of the 12th Congress 
held at Calcutta he said : {Kesari, January 12th, 1896) 

" For the last twelve years we have been shouting 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 87 

hoarse, desiring that the Government should hear us. 
But our shouting has no more affected the Government 
than the sound of a gnat. Our rulers disbeheve our 
statements or profess to do so. Let us now try to 
force our grievances into their ears by strong constitu- 
tional means. We must give the best political educa- 
tion possible to the ignorant villagers. We must meet 
them on terms of equality, teach them their rights and 
show how to fight constitutionally. Then only will the 
Government realise that to despise the Congress is to 
despise the Indian Nation. Then only will the efforts 
of the Congress leaders be crowned with success. Such 
a work will require a large body of able and single- 
minded workers, to whom Politics would not mean 
some holiday recreation but an every-day duty to be 
performed with strictest regularity and utmost capa- 
city." 

Closely in the heels of the Famine followed the Plague 
which has till now exacted the heavy toll of one crore 
of Indian lives. The feU nature of the disease 
and its sudden irruption created a consternation which 
was aggravated by the helplessness of the medical 
science in arresting its spread. The medical advisers 
of the Government failed, at first, to take any serious 
notice of the disease and when at last its looming sha- 
dow terrified the European nations and it became 
evident that not only had the plague become really 
virulent but also threatened to scare away European 
trade, strictest sanitary measures were devised to stem 
its tide. But trouble arose in the execution of these 
measures. Actuated, no doubt, by an earnest desire 

o stamp out this unwelcome guest in minimum time. 



88 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the Government officers rigorously enforced measures 
for the safety of the people. They however failed to 
temper their rigour by enlisting popular sympathy. 
They neither sought public support and co-operation 
nor did they welcome it when spontaneously offered. 
Such benevolent execution of precautionary measures 
required a higher type of imagination than the Bureau- 
crants could command and while men like Lord San- 
dhurst sincerely wished the least interference witH the 
conveniences of the people, the plague measures actually 
created greater terror than the epidemic itself. 

To save themselves from the epidemic, many so- 
called leaders of the people left Poona to a safer retreat. 
But Mr. Tilak did not do so. He stood by the suffering 
multitude, shared their misfortunes, helped them, 
started a Plague Hospital and did his best to interpret 
the difficulties of the people to the Government and the 
wishes of the Government to the people. The conduct 
of Mr. Tilak in thus co-operating with the Government 
was strongly criticised by many of the followers of 
Ranade and insinuations were recklessly made that the 
Lion of Poona was ensnared by the additional member- 
ship of the Legislative Council. The time soon came 
when the pseudo-lions of Poona humiliated themselves 
before the British Lion, while Mr. Tilak refused to be 
cowed down by the terrors of repression. 

For an effective crusade against the Plague, the re- 
lief work was taken — without any semblance of law 
or justice — out of the hands of the Municipality and was 
continued by a special body, called the Plague Commit- 
tee, a purely European association headed by the '* sul- 
len and suspicious " Mr. Rand. With the name of this 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 89 

self-willed, unsympathetic and unlucky administrator 
is associated the segration-work, with its inevitable 
corollary of the house-to-house search-parties. Afraid 
and terror-stricken, the people were, it was thought, 
unwilling to communicate to the proper authorities 
plague-attacks of inmates in their houses or to allow 
their ailing relatives to be taken for treatment to the 
hospitals. But the administrators of the plague- 
policy never put themselves the question " Why." Mr. 
Tilak showed how " as soon as a patient is removed to 
the hospital, his relations are taken to the segregation 
camp, some of the infected property is destroyed and 
his house is kept " practically " open without anybody 
to take care of the property." He also pointed out 
that people were more ready to send patients to the 
hospital started by him and to pay for them than allow 
them to be taken to the Government Hospital, which 
was a charitable institution. The question resolved 
itself into " how to make the work popular " and with 
this end in view he made a number of constructive sugges- 
tions. But it was not in the nature of the officers ap- 
pointed, to appreciate the popular view-point and ac- 
cept suggestions, most of which they could have adopt- 
ed without sacrificing the essentials of their policy. 
Even then trouble could have been avoided, had the 
British soldiers not been appointed to conduct the 
searches. Mr. Tilak held that " howsoever a British 
soldier may be useful on the battlefield, he is not suited 
for a work of this kind " and suggested that the work 
** can be equally, if not more efficiently, carried on by 
native agency working under Civil Officers than by 
British soldiers whose ignorance of native manners 



go LOKAMANYA TILAK 

very often leads them to unnecessarily offend the 
susceptibilities of the people." But this advice was 
unheeded. 

It is unnecessary to dwell here upon what wab rightly 
or wrongly described as the "reign of terror " at Poona 
and its echoes in England, so sadly associated with the 
name of Prof. (aften\^ards Hon. Mr.) Gokhale whose 
statements regarding the outrages made by British sol- 
diers exasperated the Government and who immediate- 
ly on his return to India was induced to tender an "ab- 
ject '* apology and withdraw not only those charges 
which for want of evidence he could not substantiate, 
but all his criticism regarding the plague measures. 
For a time the Plague subsided but the discontent its 
administration had aroused, emboldened one fanatic 
to seek redress in the murder of Mr. Rand. The 
name of this fanatic was Damodar Chapekar, who 
after a number of unsuccessful attempts to track 
Mr. Rand at last got hold of him, on the night of 
June 22, 1897, when Mr. Rand was returning from 
the Government House where he had gone to 
attend the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee 
of Her Majesty the Queen Victoria's accession to 
the throne. In the darkness of night, Chapekar 
shot Mr. Rand dead. His accomplice heard an 
exclamation from the carriage which Lieutenant 
Ayerst was riding and " thinking possibly that they 
were discovered " killed Lieutenant Ayerst also ! These 
shocking murders created an atmosphere of panic and 
consternation which was cleverly exploited by Mr. 
Tilak's enemies to induce the Government to embark 
on a campaign of repression. 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! Qt 

The "panacea " to plague was soon discovered in the 
'* innoculation." Mr. Tilak frankly disbelieved in the 
efficacy of a remedy which required the injection of a 
poison at every visitation of the plague. He com- 
plained of the low vitality of the people, due to poverty 
and starvation, and declared that unless that was re- 
medied, such epidemics were bound to recur. Partly 
as a result of Mr. Tilak's opposition, the Government 
were wise enough not to resort to compulsion with res- 
pect to inoculation. They simply tried to make it 
" popular by various means."

^T^HE cruel murder of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst 
threw the Anglo-Indian community.into a state of 
panic. The psychological day of the Jubilee selected by 
the murderer for his deed, raised suspicion in the Anglo- 
Indian mind that the murder was the result of a deep- 
laid plot by the Poona Brahmins. When the murderer 
made good his escape, the Anglo-Indians vented their 
feelings of revenge in an attack on the Indian press 
which, by its " seditious writings, " was considered to 
have fanned the people into frenzy. They clamoured for 
a very wide use of Sec. 124A of the Penal Code. 
They declared their misgivings about the suitability 



THE LOKAMANYA 95; 

of that section for trying subtle writers and speaker- 
and called for a mere stringent definition of sedition. 
They fell foul of Lord Sandhurst for not having vetoed 
the very recent election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative 
Council. They feared* " lest in proclaiming that dis- 
loyalty is no disqualification for nomination by Govern- 
ment, to places of honour. Government themselves 
should make good citizenship at a discount." Extracts 
from the Poona press were published and though the 
Anglo-Indian papers modestly said that it was for them 
to * " establish a direct connection between this wild 
teaching and that deplorable event" still, *" the atmos- 
phere which such teaching must have created is pre- 
cisely the atomsphere in which violence to individuals, 
hatred of Government and widespread contempt for 
law and authority would necessarily grow as in a 
forcing house." 

The position of Mr. Tilak in the months immediately 
preceding the murder of Messrs. Rand and Ayerst was 
unenviable. His co-operation with the Bureaucracy 
had been bringing him slings from the vernacular papers 
belonging to the party led by Ranade and Gokhale. 
At the same time, every word of his speeches and wri- 
tings was sifted and translated by an ever-watchful 
Government and the malicious Anglo-Indian Press. 
Some of his simplest and most innocent remarks excited 
undeserving suspicion. When on the occassion of the 
Shivaji Festival, he had simply defended Afzulkhan's 
assassination by Shivaji, he was considered to have 
preached political murder. When he said " No 
copper plate was given to Mlenchhas (Mahomedans) to

rule over Hindustan, one "Justice/' who presumably 
was a ' Native ' and whose ignorance of Marathi was 
therefore unpardonable, quoted this sentence in the 
Times of India mistranslating it to apply to the Maho- 
medans and Christians as well and asked whether it 
did not amount to an incitement to sedition against the 
Govenment. When Mr. Tilak drew the attenton of 
the leaders of Poona to the " futility of mere clamour 
against the high-handedness of the authorities " and 
suggested that the best course for the Poona leaders 
was to have remained in the city (Poona) and formed 
vigilance-committees for each street and afforded pecu- 
niary help to the private plague hospital, the Times of 
India quoting the remark after the murder said " Though 
we do not offer any suggestions as to the view that a 
Jury might be persuaded to take of the Hon. Mr. Tilak's 
discourse on the * futility of mere clamour ' against 
Mr. Rand and his assistants, still some one with a 
pistol in his hand seems to have been in hearty agree- 
ment with the Honourable Member's distrust in the 
efficacy of ' mere clamour '." 

The sequence of dates also was considered to be sig- 
nificant. On May iith 1897, Mr. Tilak published the doc- 
trine of the " futility of mere clamour." On June 12th 
he supplemented it by justifying Shivaji's murder of 
Afzulkhan. At the same time he declared that " no 
copperplate has been given to the Mlenchhas (applicable 
equally to Mahomedans and Christians) by God to rule 
over India.'* If all these statements be put together, 
" do they not" said the average x\nglo-Indian, "amount 
clearly to a plea of pohtical murder ?" Lord Sandhurst 
was however saner. He did not tliink so. That is why 



THE LOKAMANYA 95 

after the murders of Rand and Ayerst he sanctioned 
the election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative Council. 
But " the unreasoning panic into which the Anglo- 
Indian community was driven by such malicious at- 
tacks and its unfortunate success in inflaming the 
EngUsh people, forced the hands of the Secretary of 
State and Lord Sandhurst had to take measures which, 
it is beheved, he would never have sanctioned, if he 
had remained a free agent.*" 

So excited were the feelings of the Anglo-Indian com- 
munity that even " on the brink of a gaping grave 
giving a peep into the eternity " " the pride of the 
Europeans left no room in their hearts for better emo- 
tions " and persons like Dr. Cawasji Jehangir, once 
Sheriff of Bombay, were on the occassion of Mr. Rand's 
burial insulted and refused admission by the police at 
the cemetery. A Parsi lady who had attended the 
cemetery for the purpose of putting a wreath on the 
cof&n of Mr. Rand was also not admitted. The threat- 
ening speech of Mr. Lamb, the then Collector of Poona, 
foretelling that people would " find themselves under- 
going an experience to which they had not been accus- 
tomed " was another straw indicative of the direction 
of the wind. A punitive police was imposed on the 
Poona Municipality. Prof. Gokhale, immediately on 
his return from England and while yet ashore, had to 
concede " the best part of his attention " to the head 
of the Bombay Police — the result being a humiliating 
apology tendered by him to Lord Sandhurst, the Plague 
Committee and the British Soldiers. Mr. Tilak as the

editor of Kesari was arrested on 27th July 1897 at 
Bombay where he had gone to seek legal redress 
against the reckless statements made against him 
by the Times of India. The printer of the Kesari 
was also arrested. The Editors of the Poona 
Vaihhav, the Modavritta, the Pratod were also arrest- 
ed. The Editors of the Dnyanprakash and Sudharak 
bent their knees and saved themselves from pro- 
secution. The Natu Brothers were deported under 
the notorious regulations of 18 18. Altogether it 
appeared that a 'reign of terror ' had been fully 
established at Poona and that the Collector's threat 
had been literally carried out. 

After a series of preliminary proceedings Mr. Tilak 
was set free on bail by Mr. Justice Tyabji on August 
4th. The conclusion his Lordship arrived at was that 
*' the articles in question, * * about which he desired to 
say clearly * * that he gave no positive opinion one way 
or the other, were not necessarily of such a character as 
to lead one to the irresistible conclusion that the man 
responsible for such articles must be convicted upon 
them." One of the incriminating articles was a poem 
— the production of a poetaster — supposed to be ad- 
dressed by Shivaji to the Mahrattas exhorting them to 
be up and doing and the other was the report of Mr. 
Tilak's speech at the close of the Shivaji Festival de- 
fending Shivaji's murder of Afzulkhan . On this slen- 
der foundation was the edifice of the prosecution con- 
structed — a rhetorical piece in poetry from some obs- 
cure poet and a report of a speech defending Shivaji's 
greatness and insisting upon his claim to be recognised 
as a national hero. 



THE LOKAMANYA 97 

At the Bombay High Court, the trial commenced on 
August 8th, 1897 before Mr. Justice Strachey and a 
Special Jury of nine of whom six were Europeans, 
unacquainted with the Marathi language, " What with 
the tendencies of the times, th e present temper of the 
European community in India, the prejudice excited 
against the Mahrattas of Poona since the murders of 
Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst "* the verdict was prac- 
tically a foregone conclusion. " The case was one of 
the greatest importance and involved the settlement 
of grave issues. It was too much to expect so young 
and inexperienced a judge as Mr. Arthur Strachey to 
rise equal to the importance of the issues before him "*. 
Had the trial been held at Poona both the Judge and 
the Jury could have acquitted themselves better on 
account of their intimate knowledge of the Vernacular. 
In vain did Mr. Tilak protest that the translations of 
the incriminating articles were incorrect ; in vain 
did Mr. Pugh, his Counsel point to Mr. Tilak 's fair cri- 
ticism of the Government during the Plague adminis- 
tration, his complimentary language with respect to 
Lord Sandhurst which showed that he {Mr. Tilak) could 
have had no animus against the Government. Though 
Mr. Lang, the Advocate-General, was scrupulously 
fair, the Judge dehvered a strongly prejudiced charge 
to the Jury. " It seemed that the Judge and the 
Advocate-General had interchanged places." " Mr. 
Justice Strachey freely referred to the famine and the 
plague * * told about the employment of British troops 
not being liked by the people * * passed on to 
the Poona murders " and " without the least hesita-

tion " declared that "the inevitable result was friction 
and such a state of tension and excited feeling that» 
no wonder it ultimately culminated in the mur- 
ders of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst." Of course he 
did not mean to suggest in any way that there was re- 
lation of cause and effect between " either of these 
articles and those abominable murders." Still the 
charge of the Judge tended to create strong prejudice 
against the accused, who was pronounced by 6 jurors 
to have committed sedition ; and the Judge after 
complimenting the accused on his remarkable ability 
and influence, sentenced him (14th September 1897), to 
rigorous imprisonment for i8th months. A special appeal 
was made to the Privy Council, but it was fruitless ; 
and in the meantime Mr. Tilak was serving his sentence 
in the Yeravda gaol. 

Such was the result of the conflict — the first of its 
kind in India — between the mighty Government of 
Bombay with its immense resources and a soUtary citi- 
zen with nothing but truth, courage and a nation's 
sympathy to support him. Apparently it was a blow 
to Mr. Tilak. Since this time his relations with Gov- 
ernment were uniformly unfriendly and as a conse- 
quence even those who should have stood by him, 
generally kept him at an arm's length ; from this time 
the influential clique that guided the course of the 
Congress tried their best to put Mr. Tilak down. 
Of course, there were leaders like the Hon. Mr. (now 
Sir) Surendranath, whose relations with Mr. Tilak 
stood the shock of this prosecution and conviction. 
But the generality of the Moderate element shrank 
from any further co-operation with him. 



THE LOKAMANYA 99 

But while in one direction Mr. Tilak lost much of 
"that influence which went with moderatism, there was an 
immense accession of purity, strength and purpose to 
the National cause. Patriotism was, by his example 
and suffering lifted up from weak-kneed opportunism 
and humble mendicity to the high level of reUgion. 
Mr. Tilak's attitude was an object lesson to the people 
in manly fight and courage and suffering came to be 
recognised as the necessary qualities of a leader. The 
political leadership was, up to this time, the property 
of wealth, social position. Government patronage and 
oratorical powers. Now came the demand for leadership 
which would reveal tremendous powers of suffering 
for the cause. Evidently Mr. Tilak gave a deathblow 
to all conceptions of easy-going arm-chair leadership. 
He no longer basked in official sunshine. He was now 
no longer '* Honourable " — Rajamanya. He, however, 
became, what was infinitely greater, the " Lokamanya *' 
— the Honoured of the people. 

The gravest feature of this prosecution was Mr. 
Strachey's wholly untenable definition of ' sedition.* 
According to him ' disaffection ' did not mean any posi- 
tive feeling of hatred etc. towards the Government. It 
simply meant * want of affection.* Regarding this 
and another aspect of the case, the Daily Chronicle 
said : — 

*' Wildness, discontent, mischievous rubbish there 
may be in plenty. But we have got on with it and we 
shall get on with it again. Prove real sedition — above 
all, conclusively connect it with crime — and we should 
all favour sharp, stern punishment. But when it comes 
to overhauling poems and constructing elaborated in- 



100 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

nuendoes from eulogies of picturesque and popular 
bandits (?)... one feels that the Government are on. 
perilous path. 

" There is one aspect of the " sedition " trials in 
India which must not be lost sight of. And that is, the 
new definition of ' disaffection ' enunciated by Mr. 
Justice Strachey * * * According to him * disaffection* 
may be seditious even though it be simply strong dis- 
approval of some omission on the part of Government. 
We feel confident that such an interpretation of the law 
would not be tolerated in England and if not speedily 
over-ruled, may produce grave mischief in India." 

This was the considered opinion of an English news- 
paper and it amounts to a declaration that Mr. Tilak 
was unjustly convicted by an incorrect, arbitrary and 
novel interpretation of Sec. 124-A of the Penal Code. 
Far from over-ruling this interpretation, the Imperial 
Legislative Council gave legal status to it by amending 
on i8th February 1898 the notorious section in the 
teeth of Indian opposition. 

In the chorus of sympathy that rang the air, the 
scene at the National Congress is most significant. 
When the favourite orator of India said in thundering 
accents : — 

" I declare on my behalf and on behalf of the entire 
Native Press that in our heart of hearts we believe Mr. 
Tilak to be innocent of the charge brought against him. 
The ends of technical justice may have been satisfied 
but substantial justice has grievously failed. 
My sympathy goes forth towards Mr. Tilak in 
his prison home for whom the Nation is in tears — ". 
The whole assembly rose to their feet and expressed. 



THE LOKAMANYA lOI 

its feelings by cheering Mr. Tilak vociferously for seve- 
ral minutes, " It was a unique and unprecedented de- 
-anonstration which ushered the advent of a new force in 
Indian Politics. 

Mr. Tilak was a guest of Her Majesty's gaol at 
Yeravda till 6th September 1898, when he was released, 
nearly six months prior to the termination of the pres- 
cribed period of eighteen months. This belated grace 
was accelerated by the influentially signed petition pre- 
sented by the late Prof. Max Muller to H. M. the Queen 
Victoria. Prof. Max MuUer knew Mr. Tilak as the 
author of the ' Orion ' and it was largely due to his 
-efforts that the sense of justice of Lord Sandhurst was 
at last awakend. There was still a display of petty- 
mindedness in insisting upon an application for cle- 
mency from Mr. Tilak himself. But Mr. Tilak, who 
had manfully rejected such a humiliating offer before 
-he was convicted, was not the man to yield now. 

Prof. Max Muller's interest in Mr. Tilak enabled the 
latter to spend much of his enforced leisure profitably. 
Mr. Tilak was allowed the use of candles for a couple 
of hours at night and he utilized this opportunity to 
push on his researches into Vedic antiquities. The goal- 
diet reduced his weight from I35lbs. to 104. A slight 
improvement in his food again increased it to ii3lbs. 
This diet was also responsible for diabetes which he 
soon contracted and which more or less tormented him 
to the end of his life. He was required to do hard work 
indoors. It is really sad to contemplate the author of 
the " Arctic Home in the Vedas " caning chairs and 
painting waUs. To Mr. Tilak, aU work was equally in- 
teresting and he is said to have surprised the gaoler by 



102 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

his improvements in the mixing up of several colours^ 
The dull monotony of prison-life would have broken a*, 
less ardent spirit. But like a Yogi, Mr. Tilak had with- 
drawn all thoughts from the living present and had; 
concentrated them on the vicissitudes of the ancient 
Aryans. His happiest moments were those when ob- 
scure Vedic passages yielded their meaning to his 
searching intellect, and when he could correctly inter- 
pret the verse commencing with *Taneedahani hahulafi'* 
yasan in the Rig Veda (VII, 76, 3) he could not sleep 
for joy. Mr. Tilak's prison-life shows that he was pos- 
sessed not only of the qualities of the soldier and the 
scholar but also those of the sage, who has transcended^ 
pleasure and plain, happiness and misery and looks at 
the petty struggles of the world from the sublime 
heights of his controlled mind. 

The sudden and unexpected release of Mr. Tilak sent 
a thrill of joy throughout the country. He came out 
of the gaol a broken man — broken physically, 
never mentall3^ or morally. Old age put its inefface- 
able marks upon his face. His first duty, therefore;., 
was to recoup his health. He spent a few months at. 
his favourite sanitorium, the Sinhgad, hallowed by the 
exploits of Shivaji. Then he attended the Congress- 
(Dec. 1898) at Madras ; thence he went to Ceylon and) 
returned Poona in February 1899. During his tours in 
Ceylon, he pushed on his study of the Buddhistic cul-- 
ture and philisophy, commenced as early as 1890. 

Though the excitement of the Anglo-Indian mind 
had much to do with the troubles of Mr, Tilak, stil! 
when the case was going on, the Advocate-General had 

* Vide P. 8^ {The Arctic Home in the Vedas). 



THE LOKAMANYA I03 

distinctly admitted that the charge against Mr. Tilak 
had nothing to do with the Poona murders. In spite 
of this clear admission, the notorious Globe had the 
effrontery to remark that " Tilak " — mark the omission 
of Mr. — had directed, if not organised, the campaign 
of murder and that the Western Presidency had been 
permeated by seditious conspiracies of a most 
dangerous character with the arch-plotter Tilak as the 
head. The Times of India published these remarks ; 
but when hauled up before the Magistrate for defama- 
tion, made suitable amends by tendering a graceful 
apology which was as gracefully accepted. A suit 
was filed against the Globe in England, and the paper 
which had reviled this Poona Brahmin to eat its own 
words and tender an unreserved apology. 

It was reserved for Sir Valentine Chirol to hold Mr. 
Tilak morally responsible for the Poona murders ; and 
though Mr. Tilak failed in his attempts to legally dis- 
prove the subtle accusation, still all India holds him 
morally innocent of the charge. Directly or indirectly 
morally or actually, Mr. Tilak had nothing to do with 
murders ; and the only murder he ever talked about was 
that of Afzulkhan, in connection with the Shivaji Festi- 
val. Mr. Tilak's life was an open book, on which the 
word * patriotism ' was writ large ; and if the courts of 
justice made the mistake of confounding patriotism 
with sedition — well, he was prepared to pay the price. 
As for murder — political or otherwise — it was absolu- 
tely foreign to his nature.

Let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal mind 

In the hollow lotus-land to live and lie reclined. 

Surely surely slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore 

Than labour in the deep mid ocean, wind and wave and oar ; 

Oh, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wonder more. 

Tennyson. 

"T^ HILE the Social Reformers were remarrying widows 
and breaking castes with the ultimate object of 
making the people fit for political rights, Mr. Tilak was 
labouriouly striving to infuse vigour into the public mind 
by his passionate appeals to the great traditions of our 
History, Religion and Society. He inaugurated the 
Ganapati and the Shivaji festivals, which in spite of the 
bitter attacks of Moderates and the hostile attitude of 
the Government have now come to form a permanent 
feature of the social life of Maharashtra. These festivals 
deserve to be recorded as Mr. Tilak 's memorable contri- 
butions to our public life. 

The Ganapati festival, started in 1893 appealed to 
the religious instincts of the masses and to the religious 
and patriotic instincts of the educated people in Maha- 
rashtra. It has now taken a permanent place in the 
social life of the people and affords annually a common 
platform to the masses and the classes. It supplies 
healthy intellectual food to the ignorant masses. It 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION Ir^y 

trains up the youth of the country in organisation, 
public work and pubUc spirit. Lectures, processions, 
singing parties are the invariable accompaniments of 
the festival and they not only afford an outlet to the 
religious zeal of the people but help in fostering the 
national sentiment also and in creating an interest in the 
-outstanding questions of the day. The Reformers and 
Moderates have stood aloof from the festival and have 
misunderstood its aims and objects and its place in the 
work of the national uplift. But their opposition has 
no more arrested the popularity of the -festival than the 
howlings of the Anglo-Indian press ; nor have they 
succeeded in establishing its connection with Anti- 
Mahomedan spirit. Mr. Tilak has come and gone. 
But the bent he has given to a religious festival, 
converting it into a social and national force, 
.abides and will forever testify to his organizing genius. 
Our District and Provincial Conferences have not 
yet won a place in the life of the people and have 
been held only at odd places and have been attended 
only by the so called " educated " people. But the 
Ganapati festival is celebrated in every city, town and 
village and has more powerfully moulded the life of 
the people than any Congress organisation. 

From out the heroes who moulded Maratha History 
stands out one personality in bold relief. Brahmins 
adore him ; non-Brahmins claim him as their own. 
Mr. Ranade the great apostle of Moderation has sung 
his praises in a work that still abides. The Indian states 
which are scattered over Maharashtra owe their exis- 
tence to his efforts. Mr. Tilak therefore thought that 
round the personality of Shivaji, he could gather all the 



JO LOKAMANYA TILAK 

patriotic and national forces. The inspiration which 
western democratic teachings gave to us Was rather weak 
and essentially outlandish. But the worship of Shivaji 
was such as even the ignorant villager could understand. 
The name of Shivaji was a symbol of unity, courage^ 
sacrifice. It connoted the highest patriotic fervour. 
It stood for complete political emancipation. Shivaji 
and Swaraj were synonymous words. By starting the 
Shivaji festival in 1895, Mr. Tilak stimulated the Na- 
tional instincts of the people. He gave to a m.essage 
to the people freed from the puzzling verbiage of west- 
em democracy and which being simple and direct 
went straight to their hearts. 

The first pubHc meeting that was held in connection 
with the Shivaji memorial was organised by Mr. Tilak 
and was attended by the leading Chiefs of Maratha 
States as also by the leading Jahagirdars and the 
Inamdars of the Deccan. It was attended or blessed 
by the leading Reformers of the day. The Spiritual 
Descendant of Saint Ramdas honoured with it with 
his presence. Some Mahomedans also attended in 
true fraternal spirit. High and low, rich and poor, 
persons of every caste and creed flocked to do 
homage to the memory of the hero. 

But this unity of sentiment was short-lived. Such 
a rallying point evidently scared the Bureaucrats. 
In 1897 Mr. Tilak was convicted for having pub- 
lished * a few verses (descriptive of an imaginery 
message of Shivaji) and a report of his speech 
at the Shivaji festival. Since that time a large 
portion of those people whose happiness and posi- 
tion in life depended upon Bureaucratic goodwill^ 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION IO7 

have thought it prudent to remain aloof from the festi- 
val. The Moderates too, were afraid to co-operate 
with Mr. Tilak. In spite of these circumstances, the 
Shivaji festival has become a permanent feature of the 
pubHc life of Maharashtra ; at times it has been cele- 
brated even beyond the bounds of the Bombay Presi- 
dency, — in Bengal and in Japan. It will ever remain a 
permanent source of inspiration to the people. 

Up to 1893, inspite of acute Social Reform contro- 
versies, there was no split among the Congressmen. 
But the outbtrcak of the Hindu-Mahomedan riots 
created an unfortunate breach. Mr. Tilak was the first 
to assert that the riots were the direct outcome of the 
divide-and-rule policy, which a section of the officials 
had inaugurated. Anxious to fasten the responsibility 
on others, the Anglo-Indians and some of the officials 
threw the blame on the movement of cow-protection^ 
with which they had persuaded themselves that Mr. 
Tilak was associated. With the possible exception of Sir 
Pherozeshah Mehta and the Hon. Mr. RahimtuUa. 
Sayani, most of the Bombay politicians, later known 
by the unenviable title of Moderates, meekly gulped' 
down this pill. They chafed at Mr. Tilak for having 
blurted out the truth. They had not the courage 
even of refuting the connection which was sedulously 
sought to be established between the riots and the cow- 
protection Societies, though, a few months later, even 
the Government of Bombay ' hesitated to accept ' the 
view. The unpleasantness engendered in the course 
of these controversies, was aggravated by the Congress 
controversies at Poona (1895). To top this aU came 
the dissensions in the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, where 



lOB LOKAMANYA TILAK 

^anade had established his supremacy in i88g. 
As so often happens in India, aSairs in the 
Sabha had degenerated into cHquism. In 1895, 
however, Mr. Tilak secured a majority among 
the members. This incensed the rulers of the 
Sabha. They were long accustomed to have 
things in their own way and had no desire to 
Vbe ruled by Mr. Tilak. They, therefore, set up 
the " bewitching cry " of " compromise, as if there was 
anything to compromise at all." Prof. Gokhale under- 
took the mission of the Peacemaker. But he made 
the initial mistake of dictating terms to the victorious 
party. Knowing that his partisans were in utter 
minority, Mr. Gokhale should have proposed terms at 
least as favourable to Mr. Tilak's party as to his own. 
But he went a step further. He proposed three terms : 
(i) The Managing Committee of the Sabha should be 
composed of equal members from both the parties (2) 
The Chairman should continue to be same (that is a 
Moderate) and (3) There should be three Secretaries 
instead of the usual number of two and of these three 
only one should represent the majority. This attempt 
to hoodwink Mr. Tilak failed ; and the chafing Mode- 
rates wrecked their venegeance by practically ousting 
Mr. Tilak from the Secretaryship of the Poona Con- 
gress. But even this did not satisfy them. Unaccus- 
tomed to play the second part, they resolved rather 
to secede from the Sarvajanik Sabha than co- 
operate with Mr. Tilak. They pressed Ranade to 
allow them to start a new Political Association ; and 
after prolonged hesitation and against his better 
judgment Ranade at last sanctioned the formation of 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION I09» 

the Deccan Sabha (Nov. 1895) and thus perpetuated 
the split. 

We are prepared to concede that a frank and friendly 
secession is far better than surface-unity and so wide is 
the room for work in this country that even a hundred 
associations are welcome. To start a new association, 
however, is one thing ; and to do so after making dis- 
ingenuous insinuations against an established one is 
quite another ; and this is what the importunities of 
his whining followers led the great Ranade to do. 
Mr. Tilak severely criticised this conduct. He said : — 

" We have been accustomed to the terms, Moderates 
and Extremists in Social Reform controversies. But we 
refuse to accept these artificial differences in Politics. 
Is Mr. Tilak going to destroy the British Government ? 
Are Mr. Ranade and Prof. Gokhale going to be its 
saviours ? To plume oneself as a Moderate and to say 
that others are running after the impossible and insinuate 
that they are actuated by seditious motives shows the 
height of imprudence. If ever the Sabha has " run 
after the impossible " and has shown " extremist lean- 
ings " it was in Prof. Gokhale's regime. It had to make 
amends by tendering an apology. Mr. Ranade ought 
to know that the Sabha incurred suspicion of disloyalty 
when he himself was guiding its policy. All of us 
know how he had to move heaven and earth to remove 
the blot. Should he, knowing all this, now come for- 
ward and because he cannot command a majority in the 
body, throw aspersions at the Sabha ?" 

This then was the formal birth of the Moderate 
party. It was this disunity between the " Moderates " 
and the " Extremists " that emboldened the Bureau- 



110 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

cracy to take advantage of the psychological moment 
offered by the Poona murderers (1897) and launch on 
a policy of widespread repression in the Presidency. 
Immediately after resuming (4th July 1899) the editor- 
ship of the Kesari, after his one year's incarceration, 
Mr. Tilak made a powerful appeal to the ' Moderates ': — 
" When, two years back, the political school of Mode- 
ration sprang into existence, we had presaged as much. 
Some of our critics had blamed us for our pessimism, but 
our prophesy was fully borne out .... However, let 
bygones be bygones. Let us turn over a new leaf now. 
We find that owing to the disorders due to the plague 
and to the angry attitude of the Government, all our 
movements have come to a standstill. If we mean to 
revive them, our first duty is to close up our ranks. 
Like the crows of the fable, we, each of us, call our- 
selves peacocks. Only our opponents are crows ! But 
there is the eagle of the Bureaucracy in the sky, bent 
on confounding us, crows, peacocks and all. Should 
not the experience of the last two years make us wiser? 
There are some papers who pride themselves on their 
moderation, because they have not been prosecuted 
in 1897. ^^* i^ ^^ necessary for us to say why and how 
they escaped scot-free ? They should at least look to 
the Gile's circular before satisfying themselves of their 
innocence. Both the political parties are agreed as to 
the rights we want to get from the rulers. Both are 
agreed as to the need of demanding these rights from 
the Government and of educating the people to make 
such demands. If this is so, where is the room for 
"' Moderation " and " Extremism "? None of us ever 
dreams of breaking or transgressing the laws of the 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION III 

land while demanding our rights. What then is the 
difference ? ... Already the Government has restrict- 
ed our liberty of speech. It is suicidal, therefore, to 
•emphasise our political differences. . . . Let us not 
keep aloof from each other by creating false doubts and 
differences .... (Kesari July 4th 1899). 

Apparently the appeal fell on deaf ears : for nine 
years later, we find history repeating itself ! An open 
rupture, a bomb outrage and a policy of terrible repres- 
sion ! Shall India never learn the evils of disunion ? 

At a metting organised at Poona to do honour to 
Mr. (now Hon. Mr. ) R, P. Paranjpye on his return from 
Cambridge, poor Mr. Tilak was not even invited ! The 
organisers of the meeting were more anxious to obtain 
the recognition and patronage of the Government ! 

This, however, was only a straw, though indicative 
of the direction, in which the wind was blowing. Vari- 
ous such instances can be quoted. When Lord San- 
dhurst was about to retire (1900 Feb.), the usual ques- 
tion of a public address and a pubhc memorial was dis- 
cussed. Dr. Bhalchandra and Mr. (Dr. Sir) Chandavar- 
kar led the movement. Mr. (Sir) Dinshaw Wacha and 
Mr. (Hon. Sir) Chimanlal Setalwad were strongly 
against it, but seeing the attitude of their master, the 
Lion of Bombay, they had to yield. Ranade was 
diplomatic. He took no part in the controversy. He 
pleased himself and Lord Sandhurst by a garden- 
party. This demoralisation in the public life of the 
Presidency intensely pained Mr. Tilak. Nothing sur- 
prised him more than the attitude of Sir (then Mr.) 
Pherozeshah who had strongly opposed such a move- 
ment when Sir Richard Temple and Lord Harris were 



112 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

about to retire. Evidently the Lion was fast becoming- 
domesticated. 

The effect of this demoraUsed Bombay public atmos- 
phere on Indian politics was indeed unfortunate. The 
leaders of other Provinces had the greatest respect for 
Ranade and Mehta and implicitly followed them ; and 
when Mehta himself was losing his old fire, need we 
wonder that a change for the worse came over the 
Congress Party ? 

This weakening of spirit came precisely when the 
Bureaucracy and the Nation had just begun their 
struggle. Ever since 1896 Mr. Tilak had been trying 
hard to induce the Congress to change its time-honoured 
methods and show a little more grit. While the nu- 
cleus of the New Party in the Congress was being formed 
the patriarches of the Congress showed unmistakable 
signs of a reactionary spirit ; so much so that when at 
the Lucknow Congress (1899) Mr. Tilak wanted to 
move a resolution condemning the regime of Lord 
Sandhurst, a storm of opposition was raised. Mr. 
Tilak challenged a single delegate of the Congress ta- 
prove that His Lordship's tenure of office had not been 
ruinous to the people of the Bombay Presidency. None 
dared take up the challenge. He quoted the misdeeds 
of the Bureaucracy one by one and asked his opponents 
to say where he was exaggerating our grievances, and 
yet Mr. R. C. Dutt, the President and many other dele- 
gates were violently against Mr. Tilak's proposition. 
One clever person hinted that the subject was one of 
the Provincial interest only, and so the Congress could 
not be expected to take it up. Mr. Tilak quoted a 
number of cases where provincial matters had occupied 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION. Xl^ 

the attention of the National body. Nonplussed, the 
Congress leaders resorted to their usual tactics. The 
President threatened to resign the presidential post if 
Mr. Tilak persisted in the matter. Not liking to bring 
matters to a head, Mr. Tilak withdrew his proposition. 
At the Satara Provincial Conference, (May 1900) Mr. 
Tilak again sought to move the following resolution : — 

" That this Conference desires to place on record its 
deep sense of regret that during the last few years, the 
Government of Bombay should have been pleased to 
adopt a retrograde policy of repression and distrust, as 
evidenced by Press prosecutions, arrests and imprison- 
ments of persons without trial, widening of the powers 
of the Police . . . and it earnestly prays for a speedy 
return to the Policy of Progress . . . which had 
characterised the best traditions of British Rule in 
India." 

Here, too, the President, Mr. Gokuldas K. Parekh, per- 
haps remembering how most of the leaders of Bombay 
had been associated with the Sandhurst Memorial 
movement sought to suppress the Resolution by 
threatening to resign his post. The opposition at last 
was reconciled on one condition. The resolution, though 
not formally moved, was recorded in the proceedings 
of the Conference. This was surely creditable to 
Mr. Tilak whose party commanded an overwhelming 
majority. Out of 180 delegates, as many as 
124 had sided with Mr. Tilak and had signed the re- 
quisition sent to the President of the Conference. 

It will thus be seen that self-interest, timidity 
" policy " induced most of the Congress leaders to 
forget their duties and responsibilities to the people 
8 



XI4 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

For such contemptible opportunism, they tried to 
temper the tone of the Congress which they had nur- 
tured with true paternal tenderness and solicitude. 
arhe Congress thus lost its prestige and shattered its 
own popularity and became a " mutual admiration 
society." Its resolutions instead of being the echoes 
of the national sentiment, were the decrees of a coterie, 
none too active or progressive. Its Presidents came to 
be selected with a view to secure Government recogni- 
tion. Mr. Chandavarkar, who had kept himself 
aloof from the Congress ever since 1890, was called 
upon (1900) to discharge the duties of the Congress 
President. Official emoluments came to be the stan- 
dard of Congress recognition ; and official wrath and 
persecutions, the mark of neglect by the Congress 
authorities. Mr. Chandavarkar, in spite of his ten 
years' desertion of the Congress, could become its Pre- 
sident (1900) because he was high in Government favour 
and was likely to be appointed Acting High Court Judge, 
Mr. Tilak, in spite of his 20 years' record of courageous 
and self-sacrificing public services, had his claims for 
the honour set aside, because the Bureaucracy had 
chosen to dislike him. 

This v/as a period of violent political reaction. Hardly 
had the discontent due to famine, plague and press- 
prosecutions begun to grow less acute when the re- 
gime of Lord Curzon which, in its beginnings, had 
raised great expectations, commenced to create a sense 
of resentment, to which there is no parallel in the 
earlier history of our public life. People, who were 
dazzled by Lord Curzon's personality, energy, and 
eloquence, found it to their cost, that these noble qua- 



THE SCHOOI. OF MODERATION 115 

lities were accompanied by an utter lack of sympathy 
and imagination and by a mistaken consciousness that his 
Lordship was specially sent on earth to consolidate the 
British Empire. To Lord Curzon's imagination, India 
appeared a mere pawn in the bigger game of extending 
England's sphere of influence over Asia and in the 
bUndness of his imperialistic ego, he failed to realise the 
growing awakening in the country. His attempts to 
win popularity with the ryols by huge expenditures on 
agriculture and irrigation and by reduction of salt-taa 
and the Income-Tax and by his ostentatious solicitude 
for equitable justice between the black man and his 
white master, were completely unsuccessful. His cal- 
lous neglect of the industrial regeneration of the country, 
his anxiety to control University education, his cynical 
reference to the PoUtical Movement of the day, his 
curt refusal to encourage Indians in higher ser- 
vice, his audacious interpretation of the Queen's Pro- 
clamation, his uncalled-for interference in Local self- 
Govemment, his reckless expenditure in the unneces- 
sary Durbar at Delhi, his rude refusal to receive the 
Congress-Deputation headed by Sir Henry Cotton, 
and to top all, the memorable Partition of Bengal — 
these and many other events of Lord Curzon's 
Viceroyalty created a delicate situation which, the 
Moderates were unable to cope with. Public disap- 
pointment was at its height. Even the late Mr. 
Hume, Father of the Congress felt it his duty to 
awaken the ' leaders ' from their inglorious apathy. 
Said he : — 

" It is by consistent and persistent importunity both 
in India and England that sooner or later, wearied out 



Il6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

by your incessant appeals, the Government will be driven. 
to concede what are clearly your rights. 

*' You meet in Congress ; you glow with a momen- 
tary enthusiasm ; you speak much and eloquently. 
But the Congress closes and every man of you goes off 
straightv/ay on his private business ! Years ago, I 
called on you to be up and doing ; years ago, I warned 
you that * Nations by themselves are made ' and have 
you heeded these counsels ? You have, indeed, ever 
eagerly clamoured for and vainly clutched at the Crown 
but how many of you will touch the cross even with 
your finger-tips ?" 

And what was the response Sir Pherozeshah gave to 
the above passionate appeal ? Speaking as the Chair- 
man of the Reception Committee of the 20th National 
Congress at Bombay, he said : — 

" To those who decry the money spent upon the 
Congress as moneys wasted on a show and a tamasha, I 
would say, they are not men of real insight and true 

imagination If you realise it clearly and fully, 

there is no purpose more important, no mission more 
sacred than the one that the Congress fulfils in the 

three short days to which it confines its session 

We, delegates, representatives of this country, meet 
together, at the end of the year, to give voice to the 
pubhc opinion. 

*' But we are told that we have done this for long and 
we have done this in vain. I absolutely dispute both 
these propositions. ... To estimate the position 
rightly, let me lay before you (my) confession of Faith. 
I am an inveterate, and a robust optimist. . . I accept 
British rule, as Ranade did, as a dispensation so won- 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION II7 

derful. . . . that it would be folly not to accept it as a 
declaration of God's will. . . . We cordially confess that, 
in the main, England has chosen wisely and well.'* 

This attitude of self-satisfaction was strongly resented 
by Mr. Tilak. '* What hope is there " said he " when 
the rulers of the National Body frankly confess that 
the object of the Congress is nothing more than to 
focus the public opinion of the year 7" We can, how- 
ever, understand the difficulties of the Moderate leaders. 
It was a time of transition. The time-honoured 
methods of political life required to be replaced by a 
more militant form of agitation. That called for a 
type of courage, an amount of energy and activity, a 
degree of self-sacrifice, clearly wanting in the Moderate 
leaders. Altogether a new type of leadership was in 
requisition. But in the language of Napoleon : " the 
pear " was " not yet ripe." The psychological moment 
for Mr. Tilak to lead a frontal attack both against the 
Moderates as well as the Bureaucracy had not yet 
arrived. As Lord Curzon marched from one autocra- 
tic act to another, it slowly came nearer and nearer. 

Between 1899, when Mr. Tilak resumed his editorship 
of the Kesari and 1905, when the Partition of Bengal, 
carried out in haste and repented at leisure, put the 
final seal to the bitterness and helplessness that pre- 
vailed, Mr. Tilak's contribution to the public life was 
not what it could have been ; for from the middle of 
1901 to the close of 1904 he was involved in the earlier 
stages of the well-known Tai Maharaj case. He had 
to prepare the cases in the several suits, civil and crimi- 
nal, brought by or against him and had to examine 
witnesses on commission for months together at 



Tl8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Aurangabad, Amraoti and Kolhapur. The crimi*^ 
nal case alone engaged his attention for about tea 
months. 

Up to 1904, Mt. Tilak was only a Provincial leadeto 
The Partition of Bengal ushered into existence an agi- 
tation which gave birth to an All-India Party and by 
universal consent of friend and foe, Mr. Tilak cam©- 
to be the unquestioned leader of this party.

nnHAT, for nearly eighteen years of his life, Mr. Tilcik 
was involved in a private litigation, arising out of 
an unnatural alliance between an inexperienced young 
widow, a number of unscrupulous persons inimical 
to him and the mighty Bureaucracy hopelessly preju- 
diced against him, is known to all. The Tai Maharaj 
Case was really a flank movement on the public career 
of Mr. Tilak and was intended to drive him out 
of public life by judicially proving his dishonesty. 
Fortunately Mr. Tilak did ultimately triumph. 
But before the final victory came, he suffered two 
reverses which were fully exploited by his political 
enemies. The judgment of Mr. Justice Chandavarkar 
(1910) with its unwarranted aspersions on Mr. Tilak's 
character, was of invaluable aid to Sir Valentine 
Chirol in villifying him. Apart from the capital made 
out of it by the allies of the Bureaucracy, the 
Tai Maharaj case, in its winding courses, threatened 
to ruin Mr. Tilak in every possible way. It put him 



120 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to an expenditure of thousands of rupees and pro- 
mised to crush him financially. It took huge slices 
from his leisure ; in fact, during some of the stages of 
this never-ending case, the task of vindicating his cha- 
racter was his principle business and politics or 
literature was the work of leisure. A careful calcula- 
tion of the actual time spent by him in fighting out the 
case from its commencement to the conclusion shows 
that it took away six precious years of his time. Nor 
was the loss of time and money his only misfortune. 
The dread uncertainty of it all threw a shadow on his 
cheerfulness. Mr. Tilak's life during the better part of 
this period can be compared to the course of a ship 
which every minute stands in danger of being blown 
over by a stray mine or a torpedo. In the end, truth 
triumphed over falsehood, justice over m justice, and 
Mr. Tilak's character was completely vindicated, first 
by the judgment of the Bombay High Court (1904) and 
then by that of the Privy Council in 1915. 

Mr. Tilak was never a fatalist ; but his experiences in 
the Tai Maharaj case must have shown him what a 
great part, seeming accidents play in men's lives ! When 
on August 5th, 1897, Mr. Tilak was released on bail by 
Mr. Justice Badruddin Tyabji, he must have felt extre- 
mely thankful. But, had the High Court not released 
him on bail on August 5th, Mr. Tilak would not have 
been able to attend (Aug. 7th) the death-bed of his 
friend Baba Maharaj ; and had Mr. Tilak not met Baba 
Maharaj on that mournful day, he would not have been, 
in all probability, required to undertake the thankless 
duties of a Trustee. When Mr. Tilak saw that his friend 
was on the point of death ,he asked him to make a will ; 



THa FIERY CROSS 121 

for he knew that his friend was to leave behind him a 
widow of fifteen and an estate, burdened with debts. 
Baba Maharaj readily agreed and requested Mr. Tilak 
to draft a will. Mr. Tilak did so, in consultation with 
the dying man, and unwilling to take upon himself the 
onerous duties of a trustee, he put in the names of two 
of the neighbours of Baba Maharaj as Trustees. But 
Baba Maharaj knew that his estate would be better 
taken care of by Mr. Tilak than by anyone else 
so he struck off the names suggested by Mr. Tilak 
and put in those of Mr. Tilak, Rao Saheb Kirtikar, 
(Hon.) Mr. Khaparde and of Messrs. Kumbhojkar, and 
Nagpurkar— two clerks in his employ. Mr. Kirtikar 
having refused to do the work the main responsibility na- 
turally fell upon Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde. During 
the period of Mr. Tilak's incarceration Mr. Khaparde 
arranged for the Probate, made inventories and did 
the rest of the initial work. 

The will of Baba Maharaj contained the following 
important paragraph regarding succession and adop- 
tion : 

** My wife is now pregnant. If she does not give 
birth to a son, or if the son after birth is short-lived, 
then, for the purpose of continuing the name of my 
family, with the Vichara of the trustees a boy should be 
given, as often as may be necessary, in adoption, on the 
lap of my wife, in accordance with the Shastras, and the 
Punch should, on behalf of that son, carry on the 
management of the immoveable and moveable estates 
till he attains majority." 

On January iSth, 1S98, the widow gave birth to a 
son but he died within two months. 



122 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

When Mr. Tilak came out of jail (Sep. 1898),) he 
commenced looking after the affairs of Tai Maharaj, 
widow of his deceased friend. The estate was heavily 
burdened with debt and Mr. Tilak found that retrench- 
ment was the only way of saving it. But this 
" could not be agreeable to the young vvridow, who 
fancied herself to be the equitable owner of the estate 
and regarded her possible divestment by an adopted 
boy as a legitimate grievance. There were also harpies 
who fed on her, had made themselves more or less dear 
to her as the objects of idle amusement in her widowed 
leisure and who gradually and slyly nestled into her con- 
fidence as counsellors that whispered agreeable words 
and made pleasant suggestions." What these evil 
counsellors did, will be seen later. 

For nearly three years, Mr. Tilak in consultation with 
Tai Maharaj and other trustees made frequent enquiries 
and numerous efforts towards the securing of a suitable 
boy for adoption. The circle of relations was conside- 
rable, but a suitable adoptee could not be found in the 
Kolhapur or Pcona branches of the family of the de- 
ceased. As we now know some secret efforts were, about 
this time, being made to induce Tai Maharaj to adopt 
Bala Maharaj, brother of Pandit Maharaj of Kolhapur. 

A meeting of the trustees was held on June i8th 
190 1. The records of this meeting show that there were 
no boys available (for adoption) in the Kolhapur branch 
of the family. There were some in the Poona brancho 
but of them none was approved of. The trustees, there- 
fore, decided in consultation with Tai Maharaj, to se© 
if one was availabe in the Babre* branc h of the family.

tained and kept under observations. Certain astrolo- 
gers cast the horoscopes of the children. These proved 
favourable to (the appellant) Jagannath ; and her per- 
sonal likings appeared to point in the same direction. 
All this course of conduct pointed to the entire acquies- 
cence on the part of the widow in the Testators' wishes 
and directions, and so far there is no substantial sugges- 
tion to the contrary. On June 27th (therefore) a meet- 
ing of the Sbastris and of other persons in Aurangabad 
was summoned. The father of the boy being present, 
it was announced by the trustees that the boy was 
selected. The father was taken to the widow ; she 
asked him to give her his boy in adoption and he agreed. 
The fact was announced to the assembled guests and 
there and then, the duplicate deeds of adoption were 
drawn up, both intended to be signed and attested by 
the widow. (Another) document was a letter from the 
widow, addressed to the father and agreeing to take the 
boy in adoption. So far as giving and receiving of the 
child, these documents were prepared for and pointed to 
actual adoption in fact. 

" The preparation of the documents, however, occu- 
pied time and the hour being late, the proceedings were 
stopped but were resumed early next morning. A 
gathering was accordingly again held early on the 
28th. The deeds of adoption and the letter were 
duly executed, the boy was given in fact by his

natural father to his adoptive mother, he was re- 
ceived in fact by her on her lap in performance 
of the requisite essential of adoption, and — all being 
done — the formal ceremonies and festivals were post- 
poned to take place afterwards at Poona." 

Under ordinary circumstances, nothing further would 
have been heard of the adoption. But this simple 
transaction was destined to create a v/orld of worry 
and involve Mr. Tilak into troubles from which God's 
Grace and his resourcefulness alone saved him. Re- 
ferring to the origin of the Tai Maharaj case, Mr. Tilak 
wrote in the following strain (Kesari March 8th 1904): — 

** Every flock has its black sheep "says the proverb ; 
the City of Poona too, far famed as a centre of culture, 
has its set of scheming persons, who in the language of 
the poetj'hate for the sake of hatred.' These 'philan- 
thropic ' persons are not necessarily confined to one 
party or to one set of professions ; orthodox or hetero- 
dox, moderates or extremists, lawyers and bankers, 
cultured and uncultured — they join together for their 
own selfish ends and revel in pulling down any good 
person or thing. As long as Mr. Nagpurkar (one of the 
Trustees) had not lost his head, he tried his best to keep 
Tai Maharaj safe from the machinations of these un- 
scrupulous persons. But a time came v/hen he himself 
went over to these persons and set himself to betray the 
interests of his deceased master. 

"It is these people whom Mr. Lucas, the Sessions 
Judge, in his judgment, refers to as Mr. Tilak's deadly 
enemies. These people however knew that they were 
not sufficiently strong to ruin Mr. Tilak. They, there- 
fore, plotted to bring to their aid a powerful ally, viz. 



THE FIERY CROSS 125- 

the Government. They knew that Mr. Tilak's person 
was most distasteful to the Government. They, there- 
fore, induced Tai Maharaj to see Mr. Aston (Agent to 
the Sardars of the Deccan and District Judge) at his 
bungalow and seek his protection against the ' tyranny ' 
of Mr. Tilak. They would surely have failed in this 
diabolical intrigue had Mr. Aston been less impulsive 
or more fair-minded. But Mr. Tilak was to Mr. Aston 
what a red rag is to the bull. It was impossible in the 
very nature of things that Mr. Aston, who once had 
sentenced a poor editor to tranportation for life 
for simply writing against the Government, to -lose this 
golden opportunity of distinguishing himself and 
earning the gratitude of Government. When more- 
over he saw that some respectable (?) persons 
in the town supported Tai Maharaj, his fury knew no 
bounds. His fury incapacitated him from making 
inquiries regarding the truth or otherwise of the 
allegations. The earnest appeal of a young widow for 
protection, the strong support she had of a number of 
respectable-looking men, and the golden opportunity 
of crushing an individual odious to the Government — 
all this was too much for Mr. Aston, who promised 
protection to Tai Maharaj in his double capacity 
as District Judge and Agent to the Deccan Sardars. 
As regards the Bombay Government, their relations 
with Mr. Tilak are well-known, and their implicit faith 
in the conduct of and procedure followed by Mr. Aston 
was apparently perfectly natural." 

On July 29th, 190 1, Tai Maharaj applied for revoca- 
tion of the Probate granted to Mr. Tilak and other 
trustees. Mr. Aston, before whom the proceedings 



126 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

went on, should have really confined himself to the ques- 
tion viz. whether the grant of Probate to Mr. Tilak and 
others had become inoperative owing to the birth (and 
death) of a son to Tai Maharaj. He had no business to 
decide the question of the Aurangabad adoption. But 
in spite of Mr. Tilak 's protests, Mr. Aston allowed the 
Plaintiff to put in evidence regarding the adoption. Mr. 
Tilak was cross-examined for full 14 days. The Judge's 
opinion of Mr. Tilak as a witness is worth recording 
''Fencing, prevaricating, quibbling witness ; demeanour 
distinctly untruthful. A great deal of time was wasted 
by ambiguous replies to plain questions, which were 
repeated over and over again. Witness was repeatedly 
cautioned about fencing." Mr. Aston revoked the 
Probate, held the Aurangabad adoption disproved and 
committed Mr. Tilak under Sec. 476 (C. P. Code) to the 
City Magistrate " to be dealt with according to law." 
Seven charges were formulated against him. They 
were : — 

(i) Mr. Tilak had made false complaint for breach 
of trust against Mr. Nagpurkar, one of the 
trustees. 

(2) Mr. Tilak had fabricated false evidence for use 

by making alterations and interpolations in 
the accounts of the Aurangabad trip. 

(3) Forgery in connection with (2) . . 

(4) Mr. Tilak had corruptly used or attempted to 

use as genuine evidence known to be 
false. 

(5) Mr. Tilak had corruptly used as genuine the 

adoption deed. 



THE FIERY CROSS 12/ 

(6) Mr. Tilak had fraudulently used as genuine the 

adoption deed containing his interpolation 
over Tai Maharaj 's signature. 

(7) Mr. Tilak had given false evidence intentionally. 
Regarding none of these irrelevant charges had 

Mr. Tilak put in even a scrap of paper as evidence. 
Still the learned Judge committed Mr. Tilak to the 
City Magistrate. 

*' The Commitment was made on the 4th of April 
1902 which may be taken, as perhaps, the darkest day, 
that ever dawned upon Mr. Tilak. Just conceive a man 
of Mr. Tilak's position standing before the world which 
already contained a large number of prejudiced 
critics, a fair number of active and bitter opponents, — 
conceive a man in this condition, judicially denounced, 
as an obstinate, high-handed unchivalrous and un- 
scrupulous character, whose hand did not stop even at 
perjuries against a young, weak, and defenceless girl in 
a high family ! Here was a man who had been already 
convicted for sedition, an offence of a purely public 
character. But now was his turn come, for the bottom 
becoming knocked out of him and for his being exposed 
to the world as a character as unworthy in private as it 
had been proved to be in public life. The world won- 
dered and stared and then blinked and stood aghast. 
To a man of Mr. Tilak's education and position, the hour 
must have indeed proved the darkest ! But the lamp 
of faith was burning bright within him and those alone, 
who knew the kind of faith he had in him, could discern 
the distant silver lining with which even the heavy and 
the black clouds ranging over his head were relieved "*

128 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

While the proceedings in connection with the Pro- 
bate apphcation were going on, Mr. Tilak had approach- 
ed the High Court for a transfer of the case from Mr. 
Aston, who having granted several interviews to Tai 
Maharaj and having advised Tai Maharaj — according 
to her own admission — on certain points, had refused 
even to see the Trustees and had thus betrayed his pre- 
judice against Mr. Tilak. But the High Court did not 
grant Mr. Tilak's request for a transfer of the case, 
though when a regular appeal was made against Mr. 
Aston's judgment, the High Court reversed the Probate 
Decision. So Mr. Tilak and his colleagues were once 
more restored to their powers as trustees and executors. 

A special Magistrate was appointed to go into the 
seven big charges against Mr. Tilak. The proceedings 
commenced on September 15th, 1902. The alleged 
false complaint made against Mr. Nagpurkar by Mr. 
Tilak was first taken up for hearing. Mr. Justice 
Beaman, while finally disposing of this question declared, 
that there was nothing wrong or illegal about Mr. Tilak's 
complaint against Mr. Nagpurkar, a " salaried servant 
and agent for the estate and as such a responsible cus- 
todian of the valuable jewllery entrusted to him." It 
was his clear duty, said the learned Judge, " to allow 
inspection of the ornaments when demanded by a ma- 
jority of the trustees, on pain of dismissal for suspected 
dishonesty and criminal misappropriation." Indeed, 
the Prosecution counsel himself, had to admit, that 
there was not a single untrue statement in the com- 
plaint ! Mr. Justice Beaman further said : " Mr. Tilak 
said to the Magistrate exactly what he had said to Nag- 
purkar himself. He said ' Nagpurkar has been in posses- 



THE FIERY CROSS 1 29 

sion of a great deal of valuable jewellery belonging to 
the estate ; we have now dismissed him ; we have called 
upon him to surrender the property and account for it ; 
he declines ; from his conduct and these circumstances 
I have strong reason to suspect that he had criminally 
misappropriated some of it and I invoke your assist- 
ance as Magistrate to make him answer, to make him 
give an account of himself and his property '. I believe 
99 out of 100 persons would have done exactly what 
Tilak did." And yet Mr. Tilak had to fight fuU 8 
months before he could extract this clear judicial 
statement on such a simple question. 

But this was only the first charge. Mr. Tilak, no 
doubt was successful here; but six remained. The 
next in order related to forgery and fabrication of false 
evidence. But these were triable by a Sessions Court 
with the aid of a jury while the last and the mildest of 
all charges did not require the aid of a jury. Apparently 
the Prosecution had not the courage to take the case to 
a jury. Mr. Tilak formally applied to the Magistrate 
requesting him to take up the more serious charges first. 
But the challenge — for so it was — was not accepted. 
Mr. Tilak was tried for perjury by Mr. Clements, the 
Special Magistrate and on 24th August 1903 was con- 
victed and sentenced to 18 month's rigorous imprison- 
ment to which a fine of Rs. 1,000 was added. 

" Mr. Clements had kept ready a warrant for the Police 
and he refused to interfere in their discretion which 
was evidently to result in Mr. Tilak 's removal to jail 
without being allowed a sufficient time to give instruc- 
tions for lodging the appeal by his pleaders on the spot. 
All this, however, was anticipated, so that the appeal* 
9 



130 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

memo was drawn almost completely at home, by Mr.^ 
Tilak himself and his pleaders who knew what to expect 
in that day's judgment. Mr. Tilak was removed to jail 
immediately after the pronouncement of sentence on 
him, even to the surprise of the Sessions Judge himself 
who, while admitting the appeal and ordering bis re- 
lease on bail, almost without any arguments from Mr. 
Khare (Mr. Tilak's counsel), openly expressed his sur- 
prise at and disapproval of the indecent haste shown in 
the execution of the Jail Warrant."* 

Mr. Lucas, the Sessions Judge, reduced the sentence 
but confirmed the conviction. Mr. Tilak was hand- 
cuffed and taken to the Yeravda jail (Jan. 4th 1904) 
whence he was released on January 8th by an order of 
the High Court. The handcuffing of Mr. Tilak aroused 
Intense public indignation. Said a Calcutta Daily : — 

" We were not by any means prepared for the start- 
ling and shameful tidings which reached us yesterday ; 
the news of a distinguished gentleman of Bombay 
having been, in the Court and in the presence of the 
District Judge of Poona, manacled as a common 
felon. We say at once, and we say with the 
strongest feelings, shame upon the perpetratojrs of this 
foul and disgraceful act ! ! Whence the necessity for 
handcuffing Mr. Tilak ? Was it through fear of his 
escaping ? Nothing of the kind. It was, as some 
might say, to gratify the spite of a few Government 
Jiinderlings, who experienced the delight which the 
cowards always feel by treading on the fallen man. 
* * * * Our only wonder is and we wonder much in- 
deed, why the Governor of Bombay stands by, with hi s

hands in his pockets, when in his Presidency such a 
shameful act takes place ** 

Proceedings in the re visional appeal in the High 
Court commenced on February 24th, 1904. On the 
third of March, judgment was delivered. It was worthy 
of the judicial independence of that legal luminary, Sir 
Lawrence Jenkins. Mr. Tilak's conviction was quash- 
ed and the fine was ordered to be refunded. The Advo- 
cate-General wisely withdrew the remaining five 
charges. 

After the criminal case was thus disposed of, the 
civil case for the declaration of adoption, filed on Sep- 
tember 23rd 1 90 1 and adjourned, pending the criminal 
trial, was again taken up by the ist Class Subordinate 
Judge in June 1904. In this case, also, evidence had 
to be taken on commission at Aurangabad, Amraoti and 
Kolhapur. This work occupied several months. The 
First Class Subordinate Judge decided (July 31st 1906) 
the case in Mr. Tilak's favour. The opposite party 
(that of Bala Maharaj)* appealed to the High Court 
(Octo. 3rd 1906). About two years were taken in trans- 
lating the records. The Bombay High Court eventual- 
ly decided (1910) against Mr. Tilak. Leave was ob- 
tained (1911) to appeal to the Privy Council and the 
translated exhibits were printed and sent to England 
in April 1914. On March 26, 1915, the Privy Council 
quashed the decree of the High Court and restored that 
of the Sub- Judge. In spite of this clear decision, the 

* Tai Maharaj died in September 1903 ; and then her work 
was continued by Bala Maharaj who claimed to have been 
adopted son by her. Thus, it was a fight between Bala Maha- 
raj and Jagannath Maharaj. 



132 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Bombay Government delayed the execution of the de- 
cree on executive grounds and the estate was received 
by Jagannath Maharaj from the Court of Wards as late 
as Feb. 1917. 

We have already seen, how Mr. Aston, by his obsti- 
nate persistence in importing irrelevant matter in the 
hearing of Tai Maharaj 's application for revocation of the 
Probate, had succeeded in inflicting an amount of men- 
tal torture upon Mr. Tilak and in prolonging unneces- 
sarily the proceedings by a few years. Had Mr. Aston 
resisted the temptation of going into the question of 
adoption and trying to find matter for which Mr. Tilak 
could be criminally taken to task, the case would not 
have assumed these disproportionate dimensions. It 
would seem that the lesson of Mr. Aston was lost upon 
Mr. Justice Chandavarkar, who imported into his 
judgment the criminal proceedings against Mr. Tilak. 
The rebuke of the Privy Council on this point is severe: — 

" Their Lordships have viewed with surprise the 
charge which is made not only against the trustees but 
against the whole body of the Plaintiff's witnesses. Mr. 
Justice Chandavarkar in his judgment states * we are 
driven to believe that a considerable number of men of 
good position have conspired together to give false 
evidence.' The conclusion thus is of the most serious 
character amounting to a plain judicial finding of con- 
spiracy and perjury. Thei? Lordships {however) do not 
think that one ivord of it is justified by the evidence in the 
case'^. Referring to Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, Mr, 
Justice Chandavarkar observes that : ' They were men 
of mature years, of exceptional education and mental 

* The italics are ours. 



THE FIERY CROSS t^S 

equalities, lawyers and men of affairs of great repute 
-and good standing and both men of dominating perso- 
;iiality/ Some of the witnesses who gave evidence for 
the Plaintiff are also persons of considerable standing. 
It is difficult to understand how these men, with no 
object to gain and no interest to serve, could be sup- 
posed to have entered into the conspiracy and com- 
mitted the perjury which the High Court judgment 
"found. The conclusion come to by the learned Jtidges {is) 
■entirely unwarranted on the facts'^. 

*' Large masses of irrelevant matter (have been intro- 
duced in the Judgment of the High Court Judges). In 
July 1903 proceedings were begun to revoke the pro- 
bate granted to the trustees and subsequently criminal 
proceedings were instituted in respect of perjury. Their 
Lordships regret to observe that not only are the cir- 
cumstances with regard to the criminal proceedings 
referred to in the present litigation by the parties but 
that the depositions therein-, become matter apparently 
of materiality in the judgment of the learned judges of 
the High Court. 

" This was an irregularity of a somewhat serious charac- 
ter*. Particularly the depositions in the Criminal Case 
•seem to have been imported in bulk into the present. 
There is a risk, by such procedure, of justice being prevent- 
ed*. A civil cause must be conducted in the ordinary 
way and judged of by the evidence led therein. The 
depositions could not have been used to support the 
evidence of the Plaintiff. There (is) no warrant for 
using them for the purpose of either contradicting or 
•^discounting the evidence. It was stated to their Lord-

134 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ships that the prosecution for perjury had in the encP 
completely failed. Successful or unsuccessful, the in- 
troduction of the criminal proceedings in this civiP 
action (was) illegitimate. 

** A further mischance in point of procedure must 
now be mentioned. As already stated, the testimony of 
the Plaintiff's witnesses is not contradicted orally, and 
is internally a consistent body of evidence. But vari- 
ous minutes and documents are the subject of minute 
analysis, observation and comment by the learned 
Judges with a view to rebutting it. Their Lordships 
think it right to observe that, in view of the serious 
nature of the verdict of the High Court, they have con- 
sidered it within their province themselves to peruse 
the documents. Having done so, they are of the opi- 
nion that, taken together, they comipletely confirm the 
case made in the witness box and that there is no ground' 
for the conclusion that they either contradict the testi* 
mony or cast reasonable doubt upon it." 

The part, the Government played during the course 
of this case, decidedly lowered the people's respect for 
them. It is certainly an unconscious tribute they paid 
to Mr. Tilak. During the last hundred years, India has 
produced a number of patriots whose distinguished abi- 
lities and remarkable services to the cause of India's 
freedom will forever lie recorded in our History. If, 
out of these many persons. Government singled out Mr. 
Tilak for their kind attentions, what does the fact show? 
It was not by mere accident that Mr. Tilak was thus 
persecuted for well nigh two decades. It was because 
the Government dreaded the personality and the prestige 
of this Poona Brahmin that they went out of their way 



THE FIERY CROSS 135 

in using the Tai Maharaj case for their political ven- 
detta. There were, and there are leaders whose record 
of political service might be longer than that of Mr. 
Tilak. But they have not disdained to bask in the Sun- 
shine of Government favour. In spite of their brave 
fights, they have more delighted in co-operating with 
Government. Their efforts in the cause of the Nation 
were made in the leisure of business or profession. 
They devoted their attention only to the intelligent few 
and never cared to approach the masses. In these and 
several other respects Mr. Tilak's career bears a striking 
contrast to theirs and it was this new ideal of leadership 
which Mr. Tilak placed before himself and the country 
that frightened the Bureaucracy. It was Mr. Tilak's 
virile methods of political agitation that were responsi- 
ble for the implicable hostility with which he was pur- 
sued. Mr. Tilak never made complaints, he never 
sought reUef. He knew that such persecutions were 
the necessary price he had to pay. But we may now 
ask " What did the Government gain by all this ?'* 
They could neither bend nor crush Mr. Tilak. They 
only succeeded in getting deserved odium for having 
unduly harassed a righteous man. 

The apathy with which Mr. Tilak's political oppon- 
ents in the Presidency could behold the conspiracy 
that well-nigh threatened to engulf him, is no less re- 
prehensible. They had undoubted influence with the 
Government; they had very frequent occasions of meet- 
ing very high officers of the Government. Did they 
ever utter a word of protest regarding the Government's 
attitude in respect of this case ? Did they do their duty 
by Mr. Tilak ? Nobody ever thinks of holding the 



136 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Moderate leaders responsible for Mr. Tilak's troubles in 
the Tai Maharaj case. But their indifference to Mr. 
Tilak's fate is certainly culpable. We have yet to learn 
how to shield or protect our brethren even though they 
belonged to the opposite school. The Moderates might 
freely quarrel with the Extremists but while 
facing the Government, we all must present a united 
front. 

This long struggle was not without its benefits to Mr. 
Tilak. No doubt, it left him very little leisure, espe- 
cially in the earlier stages of the case. It did not enable 
him to take part in public activities with his character- 
istic ardour. Once he had to absent himself from the 
Congress ; on another occasion he was too busy with 
the case to find time to give evidence before the Police 
Commission. He had to cancel so many public enga- 
gements ; he had to restrict his activities to the narrow- 
est possible limits. We do not deplore all this undoubt- 
ed loss for the reason that this period (1901-1904) 
synchronised with that of the political reaction of which 
Lord Curzon was the most distinguished author. Until 
the reaction had reached its height, the movement of 
Regeneration could not start. 

When, with the Partition of Bengal, the movement 
of Regeneration started, Mr. Tilak had come unscathed 
out of this fiery ordeal. The glory of martyrdom with 
which he started work was not the most important 
benefit he had derived from the Tai Maharaj case. Mr. 
Tilak himself was changed. The Tai Maharaj case 
aimed at knocking the bottom off his character; the 
course of its first stage (i 901- 1904) tested and strength- 
ened his character. The vast conspiracy aimed at 



THE FIERY CROSS 137 

proving him to be nothing better than a perjurer utterly 
collapsed and Mr. Tilak could not, out of the gratitude 
of his heart, but recognize the Divine Hand that saved 
him from the machinations of the tremendous odds 
against him. The realisation, of this Divine favour creat- 
ed a revolution in his mentality. With all his great 
and heroic qualities of the heart — his sterling self-sacri- 
fice, his magnificent courage, his genuine humanity and 
his inborn purity, it must be admitted that Mr. Tilak 
was more of a Dnyanin than of a Bhakta. The immense 
intellectual and other powers lavishly bestowed upon 
him by an all-wise Providence were somewhat inconsis- 
tent with that tenderness, pathos and humility which 
are the essential characteristics of a Bhakta.. But the 
the excruciating mental tortures of the Tai Maharaj 
case — we are talking of the earlier stages — convinced 
him, how weak, how little man after all is, in spite of 
his intellectual and moral powers, and how in the last 
resort we have to depend upon dispensations from 
Above. When his enemies had gathered thick about 
him and had well nigh caught him in their toils, Mr. 
Tilak's spirit conferred with the Divine and strong in. 
the consciousness of Divine support, hurled defiance at 
those mortal enemies. From this period Mr. Tilak's 
speeches and writings shine with the fire of a prophet. 
To him the national struggle ceased to be merely intel- 
lectual. It was now no longer a fight of arguments. 
His politics was now spiritualised. It was this spiri- 
tual fire that enabled him to tide over reverses yet in 
store for him and bring his country within the sight of 
the Promised Land. 



## THE NEW PARTY 

Bal Gangadhar Tilak is a Maratha Brahmin, thinker an(f 
fighter in one. His is the brain that conceived, his is the pen 
that expressed, his is the force that has directed the extra-ordi- 
nary movement against which the bureaucracy is now calling 
up all its resources. 

The Morning Leader in 1908. 

rPHE year 1905 forms a land-mark in Indian History. 
In that year was carried out the fatal Partition of 
Bengal. The whole Province was thrown into a fer- 
ment. The Bengalis heartily disliked the odius measure. 
Appeals were made, monster petitions were sent to the 
Parliament. Then came the Bycott. It encouraged 
Swadeshism. The Swadeshi movement quickly out- 
grew its economic or political nature and became a 
movement for National Regeneration. The Nation 
called for Swadeshism in dress, in diet, in habits, in life, 
in arts, in literature, in science, in religion and philoso- 
phy. Swadeshism thus became an all-pervading spiri- 
ritual movement directed against the Western Civilisa- 
tion which the British Government represented and 
symboHzed. The Boycott bade fair to develop into a 
movement of Passive Resistance. Young men enrolled 
themselves as National Volunteers for peaceful partici- 
pation in public Hfe. The Government retaliated with 
the Risley Circular and the Carlyle Circular. The- 



THE NEW PARTY 13^ 

Nation demanded a National Course of Education, 
Money flowed in like water ; the National University of 
Bengal was established. These activities provoked the 
official world. Repression, the favourite weapon of 
despots, was resorted to. The leaders of the movement 
were publicity humiliated ; meetings were dispersed 
with regulation lathis. The path of repression is gene- 
rally perilous and slippery, and it is no wonder that 
** the Bureaucracy marched from one repression to 
another." The armoury of repressive measures was 
replenished. The Deportation Act of 1818 was hunted 
out and Lala Lajpat Rai and Sirdar A jit Singh were spi- 
rited away to Burma (1907). Mr. Tilak was tried for 
sedition (1908) and transported. The NationaHst Party 
was routed. Babu Ashvini Kumar and eight other 
popular leaders were deported. A few crumbs of re- 
forms, niggardly given and avidly accepted, were the 
reward of the surviving Party of Moderates who had 
shown their loyalty by rallying round the Bureaucratic 
banner. Eventually the Partition of Bengal was modi- 
fied in 1911. 

The Partition of Bengal, hateful as it was, consoli= 
dated that sense of Indian Nationality which common 
serfdom, wesstern education and the National Congress 
had done so much to foster. It is, however, remark- 
able that outside Bengal, those of the English-educated 
Indians who had hitherto too much paraded their " All 
India view " did the least to show in a practical way 
their sympathy with Bengal. Mr. Tilak, on the con- 
trary, who owing to his Shivaji and Ganapati festivals, 
was regarded to have encouraged a spirit of particula- 
rism, was to the forefront, anxious to do his "little bit**^ 



1140 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ior lacerated Bengal. He had nothing but contempt 
for those wise-acres, who were ready with their statis- 
tics and free-trade theories to throw cold water on popu- 
lar enthusiasm, who harped on the eternal theme of 
our weakness and our want of organization and who 
were afraid of the plentiful resources of the Government. 
Mr. Tilak, while admitting the force of all reasonable 
objections, declared that even an ineffectual struggle 
in the face of tremendous odds was itself no mean 
achievement. He could never subscribe to the theory 
of " learning to swim on land." 

With the commencement of the anti-Partition agita- 
tion, Mr. Tilak emerges from his life of Provincial 
Leadership and becomes the leader of the " Newborn ** 
Nationalist Party in India. Till IQ05, our public life 
could hardly be said to have been National. The Press 
did indeed keep us from relapsing into our provincial 
ruts, but even the Press or the Congress had not visibly 
created that fellow-feeling with delights in mutual help, 
support and encouragement. Most of the leaders in 
the country were known only in their provinces. A bril- 
liant member of the Imperial Legislative Council, a 
dominating leader in the National Congress or an un- 
bending fighter with the despotic bureaucracy did 
indeed get a recognition which was something more 
than provincial. But that free, swift interchange of 
thought and that inter-dependence of policies and actions 
which an organised National Life presupposes was 
totally absent. The cruel wrong done to Bengal, the 
solid agitation which the Bengalis started, together 
•with the widespread discontent caused by the reaction- 
;ary policy of Lord Curzon, afforded Mr. Tilak the long- 



THE NEW PARTY I4r 

coveted opportunity of consolidating our feeling of 
Indian Nationality by leading an All-India Movement 
for the double purpose of righting the wrong and awa- 
kening and organizing the country. 

This was a task for which he was pre-eminently quali- 
fied. In his own province, his immense popularity, due 
to twenty-five years of courageous, self-sacrificing and 
single-minded work enabled him to carry the message 
of Swadeshi and Swaraj down to the most distant ham- 
lets. He had trained up a number of people in the 
work of organization and agitation. Hundreds of his 
students, scattered over the Presidency had received 
incentive to public activities from his personal contact 
and his weekly writings in the Kesari. His frequent 
tours in Maharashtra had enabled him to organize his 
province for National work and so successful was his 
organization that no sooner did he sound the slogan of 
Swadeshi and Boycott than the note was echoed and 
re-echoed throughout the length and breadth of Western 
India. Not a village in the province but had its 
Swadeshi meetings ; not a town but had its swadeshi 
shops. 

But this was not the only work Mr. Tilak had to do 
now. There is no work more difficult than of directing, 
organizing and controlling movements in such distant 
places as Bengal, the Punjab and Madras. The difii- 
culty lies in the fact that while the initiative in several 
matters must be left to the leaders on the spot, the 
whole movement must present a single idea and a single 
purpose manifested in consistent and uniform activities. 
The leader of the whole movement must needs be a man 
who will command respect and obedience and whose 



142 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

instructions would be carried out in spirit. He must 
act both as a stimulant and a sedative ; he must use 
spurs or draw reins according to necessity. From all 
the great NationaHst leaders — Messrs. Bepin Chunder 
Pal, Arabindo Ghose, Lajpat Rai, G. S. Khaparde, G. 
Subramanya Ayer — Mr. Tilak received that homage to 
which his genius, sacrifices and long uninterrupted ser- 
vices of the country fully entitled him. The organiza- 
tion of the Nationalist Party also involved the work of 
fighting with the Moderates both in and out of the 
Congress. This was no easy thing ; for the Moderate 
Party, moribund though it was, controlled most of the 
National organisations of the day ; its leaders, with 
their long record of public service, were capable beyond 
question, learned beyond compare, resourceful and do- 
mineering. They were the last persons to allow them- 
selves to be swept away. It required all Mr. Tilak's 
genius, aided of course by the powerful ability of his 
political colleagues, to give a rub to the Moderates. In 
the Congress he was the only man who could beard the 
Bombay Lion ; and his consumate mastery of ail wea- 
pons of intellectual warfare enabled him to measure 
swords with Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. 

Mr. Tilak once said that every such movement ought 
to be judged by a triple standard (i) The actual work 
it does (2) the moral force it awakens and (3) by the in- 
tellectual revolution it brings about. The anti-Parti- 
tion movement soon lost its provincial character and 
became a movement for National Regeneration and the 
attainment of Swaraj. The swadeshi spirit stimulated 
the establishment of several industries hitherto starving. 
Swadeshi shops were opened everywhere ; Swadeshi 



THE NEW PARTY I43 

exhibitions were held to popularize the work of the new 
industries. The Paisa fund, originally started by a 
Mr. Kale, became under Mr. Tilak's guidance the most 
popular means of collecting funds for starting suitable 
industries. Spinning and weaving industries began to 
thrive. Education and Temperance received a great 
impetus. In short, the movement was on the right 
lines and promised brilliant results. 

But it is the misfortune of every infant democracy to 
be called upon to do constructive work with one hand 
while with the other it is engaged in a life-and-death 
struggle with the powers that be. 

|>f.The moral force which the movement roused was 
simply astonishing . We have seen, how under the re- 
actionary regime of Lord Curzon, disappointment and 
a sense of humiliation hung like a pall over the country. 
The swadeshi-hoycott movement dispelled all these 
clouds. It created hope and enthusiasm in the minds 
of Indians. *' Self-reliance, no mendicancy " became 
the watchword of the people. The National self- 
respect was fully awakened. People refused to take 
insults lying down. They refused to allow the foreign 
Bureaucrats to be arbiters of our destinies. They were 
willing to suffer for their convictions. They came 
forward in their hundreds to go to gaol. Young men 
worked as pickets or volunteers and received sound 
elementary training in public life. A hopelessly dis- 
organized nation seriously began to organise itself. The 
land of disunity was slowly closing up its ranks. Even 
the " depressed " classes joined, heart and soul, the 
movement and on two occassions, Mr. Tilak was the 
recipient of their pan-supari. A spirit of unity and 



144 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

equality was abroad. Mr. Tilak was everywhere praised' 
for declaring, in a public lecture, that all castes are 
equal and that graduation of castes is foreign to Hindu 
religion and is unsupported by Vedic texts. Meetings 
were held not in thousands but in hundreds of thousands. 
Poets sang of patriotism. A truly National Literature 
was born. The great revival promised to sweep away 
all barriers and deluge the country. 

The intellectual revolution produced by the move- 
ment was more remarkable still. When Lord Curzon 
cut Bengal in twain with a stroke of pen, the centre of 
gravity of all our activities changed from the Govern- 
ment to the people. It was Ranade who once said that 
our petitions, though mainly drawn out for Government 
were also intended to awaken the people. The Nation- 
alist party went a few steps further and declared that all 
our writings and speeches were intended for the people ; 
Government might, if they wanted, take note of them. 

The boycott movement gave a deathblow to all the^ 
free- trade theories in which the generation represented 
by the majority of the then leaders was trained up. 
People clearly came to realize how England had stran- 
gled Indian Industries and they were determined, in 
the absence of any protective tariff in the interest of 
Indian manufactures, to boycott British goods. 

But the greatest contribution made by the movement 
to the political life of the country was the fixing of the 
goal of aU our endeavours. Ours is perhaps the first in- 
stance in the history of the vv^orld, where for a couple of 
generations, the children of the soil did believe their con- 
querors to be their deliverers. Mr. Tilak was the first 
to give a rub to this easy-going faith. His Shivaji 



THE NEW PARTY 145 

festival, with its inevitable suggestion of the ideal of 
Swaraj was an eye-sore not only to the Anglo-Indians 
but to the Moderates as well. The former openly called 
it sedition, the latter probably thought pretty much in 
the same way and refused to take part in it. It was re- 
served for the anti-partition agitation to place before 
the country a definite ideal, freed from the confusing 
verbiage that characterised our thought tiU 1905. Mr. 
Tilak's ideal thus became the ideal of the country and it 
was ** imposed " upon the National Congress by no less 
a personage than Dadabhai Naoroji. Neither Mr. Tilak 
nor Mr. Naoroji preached anything beyond the colonial 
form of self-government. But the bitter disappoint- 
ment caused by the Partition of Bengal, together with 
the utter loss of faith of the people in the sincerity of the 
rulers carried the ideal of self-government to the logical 
length. If Mr. Tilak has on a few occasions defended 
absolute autonomy as being a perfectly * legal ' ideal, 
we should not forget that even Lord Morley has nothing 
to say against it and that the Hon'ble Mr. Gokhale has 
in his Allahabad speech (1907) declared that he would 
not put any limit to the aspirations of the people. 

It was not so much the difference of opinion regarding 
the ultimate ideal that gave birth to the two schools 
of thought, — ' Moderate and Extremist '. Ideals do 
not so much affect every day work as ways and means. 
In a word, the two parties were divided on * Boycott *, 
The attitude of the Moderates was determined by three 
things (i) They had not utterly lost their faith in the 
British Government or the Indian bureaucracy. (2) 
They had not the courage to go to the logical length of 
propositions conceded by them. (3) They were oppressed 

10 



146 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

with an undue sense of the power of the Government 
and an inordinate consciousness of India's weakness. 
Hr. Tilak thought otherwise. He said : — 

" We do not beUeve in philanthrophy in PoHtics. 
There is no instance in history where a foreign nation 
has ruled another without any expectations of profit. 
We beHeve in Lord Morley and in the genuineness of his 
professions as a philosopher. The old school thinks 
that politics could be governed by the dictates of philo- 
sophy ; we hold that these are quite different things and 
ought not to be mixed up together. The old school 
thinks that concessions could be secured by logical per- 
suation. 

" Mr. Gokhale believe in sacrifice. He calls upon 
the people to be up and doing. He accepts even pas- 
sive resistance as a constitutional weapon. He admits 
that the Bureaucracy here is callous and the Democracy 
at ' Home ' is indifferent. He allows that our efforts 
have not yet borne sufficient fruit. He declares that 
the situation is critical. In all this he is at one with 
the New Party. But when it comes to action he will 
say ' My friends, let us still wait a little. No use 
flouting the Government. They will suppress us.' It, 
therefore, comes to this. Mr. Gokhale belongs in theory 
to the New Party, and in practice to the old one." 

One of the greatest defects of the Moderate leaders 
has been their habit of clinging to unmeaning words and 
phrases. One such was " Constitutional agitation." 
Mr. Tilak called upon the Moderate leaders to explain if 
India had got any constitution. " Can we prevent the 
violation even of those common rights we have ? Can 
,"we punish these violations by holding the executive 



IHE NEW PARTY I47 

Government responsible ? The only ' constitution ' we 
have is the Penal Code !" Mr. Gokhale in his Allahabad 
lecture admitted in one breath that every form of agita- 
tion from the non-payment of taxes down to the sending 
of petitions is constitutional ; and in another he declar- 
ed that "constitutional agitation is an agitation to bring 
about changes in the administration through the consti' 
tuted authorities !" This novel interpretation of a well- 
known phrase in constitutional law excludes such severe 
forms of agitation as the non-payment of taxes ! 

Mr. Tilak held that though our agitation would be 
law-abiding in the ordinary sense of the term, still it 
all rested with the Government whether to make it 
legal or illegal. A movement which was perfectly legal 
to-day could by a fiat of the Bureaucracy be made 
illegal to-morrow. We would certainly refrain from 
rebellion, murder, arson, and the like. But barring this 
well-understood limit, there was none other which we 
could put to our endeavours. Our agitation could not be 
constitutional because we have had no constitution worth 
the name. It could not be exactly legal as the power of 
making laws rested with those whose interests clashed 
with ours. Therefore, said Mr. Tilak, justice, morality 
and history must be our only guides. 

En passant we may note that when last year the 
question of changing the creed of the Congress came 
before the chosen leaders of the people, Mahatma Gandhi 
with his unerring sagacity, rejected both the words 
** constitutional " and " legal " and in their place put 
in ** peaceful and legitimate methods," an unconscious 
paraphrase of the triple limitations of justice, morality 
and history put by Mr. Tilak, 



148 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Many an admirer of Mr. Tilak has deplored his lack 
of the gift of the gab. Persons are not wanting who 
say " Had Mr. Tilak been an orator, he would have 
vanquished the Moderate party long before he actually 
did.". .Though not an eloquent speaker, Mr. Tilak was 
always an effective one. Even so fastidious a critic as 
the Hon'ble Mr. Chintamani has recorded his praise of 
Mr. Tilak's speech (at the Calcutta Congress of 1896) on 
Quinquinnial Provincial Contracts. Another Congress 
speech of Mr. Tilak was pronounced, by a high authority 
to have had " a genuine Maratha ring about it." Mr. 
Tilak's platform speeches, English or Marathi, always 
produced profound impression on his hearers ; for, as 
Lord Morley says *' Political oratory is action not words; 
action, character, will, conviction, purpose and person- 
ality." Mr. Tilak, deficient in words, had enough of 
character and personality. These made him quite 
irresistible. 

The Indian Patriot describes Mr. Tilak's political 
oratory in the following judicious words : — 

• Of all political thinkers in India, Mr. Tilak has the 
invaluable gift of shedding dry light on the subject of- 
his discourse, without converting his address into an 
appeal to our emotions merely. Nor does he desire to 
re*iterate commonplace observations and stale and super- 
ficial sentiments. On the other hand, it has been his> 
aim whenever he comes forward to make a public pro- 
nouncement, to convince the intellect of his hearers, to 
overcome the doubts and difficulties of his audience, 
and to take up the strongest position of his opponents^ 
and establish his own, in the light of reason and logic> 
as the more sustainable ground. ... He does not give 



THE NEW PARTY 14^ 

'I3ie impression of one who has been hustled to take up 
an attitude or who desires to hustle others into an opi- 
nion which he has ready for them. He argues out the 
position logically and unflinchingly and leaves it to 
others to judge whether his conclusions deserve their 
assent or not. . .He dissects the position, as a biologist 
would dissect an organism, and with cold conviction 
explains the bearing of each dissected part to the rest 
and is content if he is able to be plainly and unerringly 
understood." 

Another critic (The Indian People) is no less eulogis- 
tic : — "As a speaker, Mr. Tilak has nothing of 
the demagogue or the impassioned platform orator 
about him. There are no high-sounding phrases, no 
flights of rhetoric. His manner is subdued and free 
from gesticulation. The sentences are terse ; the 

language is simple and direct He appealed 

to the intelligence of his audience and not to 
their sentiment. The real power lay in the matter 
of his speech and not in the manner. There were 
no generalisations, no enunciation of abstract prin- 
ciples in flowery language. Every statement was clear 
• and every point was driven home with a readiness 
of illustration and power of antithesis that showed the 
power of the speaker and the subtlety of his intellect. 
Every issue was put plainly and uncompromisingly. 
But there was no violence of language or denunciation, 
not a trace of passion either in word or gesture. After 
hearing him it was not difficult to understand that he 
is the most powerful and the most influential leader of 
the New Party, a party by no means confined to Ben- 
.gal." 



150 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

It is quite natural that when the Nation had, with 
grim determination, undertaken to find its own salva- 
tion, the powers that be should try to put us down by 
every means at their disposal. The Bureaucrats deter- 
mined to separate the Mahomedans from the Hindus,, 
and the Moderates from the Extremists ; they resolved. 
to replenish their armoury of repressive laws, to crush 
the Extremists and break that solidarity which was 
growing in various provinces. The Bureaucracy knew 
that to placate Lord Morley they would have to give 
their consent to the inauguration of a few political re- 
forms here and there ; so they practically entered into 
a compact with the Liberal but too philosophical Secre- 
tary of State by means of which ' honest John * was to 
acquiesce in their repression and they agreed to tole- 
rate political concessions. England had just concluded 
an alliance with Japan ; our rulers had therefore noth- 
ing to fear from any complications abroad. They had 
thus greater facilities to repress us than their succes- 
sors in 1914 and 1920, and so with ruthless severity 
they tried the axe of repression on the tender plant of; 
the National Movement. 

The Swadeshi movement, with its watchwords of 
self-help and self-government, powerfully affected the 
imagination of the Indian student world. Students 
became the greatest bulwark of the National agitation. 
There were well-meaning persons who held that stu- 
dents ought to stand aloof from the public life of 
the country. Even Mr. Gokhale, though willing to 
allow students " to take interests in what was going; 
on around " them was not in favour of allowing them to- 
take an active part even in the elementary work which. 



THE NEW PARTY 



151,3 



neither breeds nor " leads to dissension and disintegra- 
tion. '' Mr. Tilak, on the contrary emphatically held 
that the " students of to-day are the citizens of to- 
morrow "and that it was their duty not only to study 
public questions but to devote part of their leisure in 
such work as was allotted to them by the trusted lea- 
ders of the country. Mr. Tilak said that though it was 
convenient for the Bureaucracy to forget the part which 
the youth of England played in the public life of 
England, India must never neglect to train up her 
youth in pubHc spirit. If the Risley Circular was to 
prevent free expression of thought in youth, if the Gov- 
ernment Servants' Rules were to prohibit u? from 
participating in public activities in manhood, and if the 
Pensioners' Code was to guide our actions in old-age^ 
when, indeed was a man independent ? Mr. Tilak 
emphatically condemned the actions of those who, be- 
cause a particular student attended a swadeshi meeting, 
fined him in the name of discipline ! If, he said, a severe 
enforcement of false discipline be the price of our ac- 
ceptance of Government Grant or of the affiliation 
with the University, why, in the name of patrio- 
tism and self-sacrifice should we not break off these 
chains and declare our educational independence ? 
He accepted the right of elders to guide the students. 
But he refused to accept the right of any parent, much 
less teacher, to cut off the light of knowledge and patri- 
otism from the school and college-going children ; and 
when such a prohibition was made only because the 
parent or teacher had not the courage to assert himself 
before an unjustifiable fiat of the Bureaucracy, the stu- 
dents were, Mr. Tilak said, fully entitled to disobay. 



j02 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

The Students' movement of 1905 was quite different 
from the educational boycott of the Non-Co-operation 
Propaganda of to-day. The Non-co-operator would 
like to empty school and colleges, to mark his protest 
against the ruinous system of administration. The 
stimulus which the movement for National Education 
received in the Anti-Partition days lay entirely in re- 
pression. In Bengal, where the student world was 
harassed and persecuted, the movement of National 
Education spread like wild fire, and within less than an 
year since the movement was inaugurated, nearly 
10,000 students enrolled their names in the National 
Schools and colleges, directed by leaders of the Mode- 
rate Party like the late Dr. Rash Behari Ghose and the 
late Sir Gurudas Banerjea. In Maharashtra, on the con- 
trary, repression being comparatively mild (1905-07), 
there was less opportunity for National Education to 
grow. The Samartha Vidyalaya established by Prof. 
Bijapurkar and patronized by Mr. Tilak was a model 
institution of its kind and would have shown very good 
results had not the Government with one stroke of the 
pen suppressed it (1910). 

Mr. Tilak was immensely proud of the Mahomedans. 
He was convinced that the community with its Impe- 
rialistic traditions had a great future before it. He was 
certain that a combination of the Hindu intellect and 
the Muslim valour (together with the Parsi enterprise) 
would be irresistible and was bound to bring about the 
downfall of the Bureaucracy. He was more afraid of 
the Moslem inertia than of Moslem opposition. When, 
therefore, Nabob Salli-Mulla Khan held (December 
1906) an " Educational Conference " at Dacca and con- 



THE NEW PARTY 153 

verted it, at the eleventh hour into a PoHtical League 
to protest against the Boycott and Swadeshi move- 
ments, to uphold the Bengal Partition and to praise Sir 
B. Fuller to the skies, Mr. Tilak was rather delighted 
than vexed. He foretold that once the great Muslim 
Community was aroused, it would outstrip the Hindus 
in political demands. Of course, he severely con- 
demned the attitude of the Mahomedans on the occa- 
sion of the disturbances at Comilla and Jamalpur. 
He fully approved of the Manifesto of fifteen Bengali 
leaders including (the Hon'ble Sir) Surendranath Ban- 
erjea which described how *' Hindu shops have been 
looted ; Hindu temples have been desecrated ; the 
images of Hindu deities have been defiled ; the Cutche^ 
eries of Hindu Zemindars ransacked ; Hindu women 
have been outraged "; he condemned in scathing terms 
officers and Mahomedans alike who were responsible for 
this lawlessness. But he knew that a day would come 
when the " favourite wife of Sir B. Fuller " would be 
awakened to a full sense of her duty and would no 
longer allow the Bureaucrats to " Divide and Rule ' 
us. 

With the growing awakening in the Nation, the tide 
of Repression began to rise. Lord Morley, from his 
philosophical seat in the India Office was unable to 
arrest either the one or the other. From his Presi- 
dential chair at Benares, Mr. Gokhale had told the 
world how he "felt towards Mr. Morley as towards a 
Master " and how his heart leapt " with hope and fear " 
at the appointment of the Biographer of Gladstone to 
India Office. Mr. Morley, so trusted and revered, did 
SkOt hesitate in his budget Speech (June 1907) * reluc. 



154 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

/ tantly to call the Educated Indians as enemies. Tlic 
student of Mill and Bright repeatedly declared " so 
long as my imagination could reach, India for a long 
time to come, must continue to be the theatre of abso- 
lute and personal rule ;" and yet the Moderates were 
ready, nay, eager to welcome his reforms as being 
" generous and just !" 

This policy of " hearty repression and halting conces- 
sions '* created an acute situation, straining almost to 
the breaking point the already delicate relations be- 
tween the Moderates and the Extremists. In the next 
chapter, we shall see how these relations culminated- 
into the unfortunate split at Surat. 


## TILAK AND THE CONGRESS— II 

The days of absolute leadership are gone, never to return 
back. 

N. G. Chandavarkar 

Tj^LSEWHERE we have traced Mr. Tilak's connection 
with the Congress from 1889 down to the early 
years of the present century. We have seen, how, 
in the period of poUtical re-action, beginning 'with 
1897, the Congress leaders showed their ** states- 
manship," by scrupulously following a policy of 
Moderation, which, very often meant inaction, timi- 
dity or indifference to the National good. 
Ever since his return (1899) ^^ public life after 
one year's incarceration,Mr. Tilak had been fighting with 
these tendencies in and out of the National Congress. 
but what with his pre-occupations in the Tai Maharaj 
Case, and what with the small following he had in the 
Congress, he could not effectually raise his voice against 
the policy of inertia and negation, which Sir Pheroze- 
shah later came to glory in. From 1905, however all 
this was changed. The wave of awakening in the coun- 
try strengthened the nascent New Party and Mr. Tilak 
could get that amount of following in the Congress 
which was required to put up a fair fight. This tended 
to enUven the proceedings of the Congress and increase - 



156 # LOKAMANYA TILAK 

its popularity. Mr. Tilak determined that the Congress 
should no longer retain its moribund character. He 
resolved that (i) the Congress tradition of seeking 
official favour, or at least official recognition must 
be broken ; (2) the National sentiments must be 
more faithfully echoed in the Congress resolutions ; 
(3) The Congress must no longer remain a holiday 
gathering, but must work continuously and lead the 
National agitations. This was a war between auto- 
cracy and democracy, oldage and youth, apathy and 
enthusiasm, between timidity and courage. The old 
generation tried to win the officials ; Mr. Tilak 
sought to inspire and organize the people of the country. 
At the Benares Congress (1905) Mr. Tilak got much, 
though not all, that he wanted. Sir Pherozeshah, " the 
Autocrat of the Congress " was absent ; and the Presi- 
dent, Mr. Gokhale, had enthusiastically championed the 
Bengalees' cause in England and had justified the in- 
aguration of the Swadeshi Boycott movement in 
speeches which came as a surprise to many of his fol- 
lowers. In his Presidential address, he severely criti- 
cized the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon, compared it with 
the odious reign of Aurangzeb and spoke in favour of 
Swadeshi and Boycott. Mr. Tilak wanted separate re- 
solutions on Swadeshi and Boycott. The resolution, 
justifying the Boycott of British goods, as perhaps the 
only constitutional and effective means left to the 
Bengalees, was huddled up with the condemnation of 
the repressive Policy of the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak 
would have liked an independent resolution on the sub- 
ject. He wanted the Boycott resolution to go one 
step further and call upon the various Provinces of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II ^ 157 

India to prove their sympathy for the Bengalees by 
adopting Boycott, but evidently, the Moderates were 
not yet prepared to recommend Boycott for aU the 
provinces. Mr. Tilak, however, was not discouraged* 
The Congress, he said, had broken its tradition by sup- 
porting the Boycott and he looked up to the next Con- 
gress at Calcutta, to vigourously continue the work so 
substantially begun at Benares. 

In June igo6, Mr. Tilak paid a visit to Calcutta on 
the occassion of the Shivaji festival. Soon after, Babu 
Bipin Chander Pal made the proposal that Mr. Tilak 
should preside over the Calcutta Congress. This was 
the first time in the history of the Congress when Mr. 
Tilak 's nam.e was seriously proposed for the highest 
honour at the disposal of the Nation. Mr. Pal was not 
content merely with proposing Mr. Tilak's name. He 
carried on a regular campaign. The Moderates were 
afraid. Sir Pherozeshah set racking his brains to avert 
the " catastrophe." Babu Surendranath, evidently 
smarting under the misrepresentations of the " crown- 
ing " incident promised every possible help to the Lion 
of Bombay. At last a master stroke was delivered A 
cable was sent to Dadabhai Nooroji, the G. O. M. of 
India ; it said that the Congress was in danger ; would 
Dadabhai return to India and preside over the Congress? 
The Cable was despatched by Babu Bhupendra Natb 
Basu, the right-hand man of Babu Surendranath. 
Without consulting his colleagues, without consulting 
the Reception Committee, he took this step, relying 
upon Dababhai's innocence and fidelity. Dadabhai 
was the last man to shirk help when the Congress was 
reported to be in danger. At once he cabled back aa 



158 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

affirmative and the Moderates were delighted at having 
out-witted the Extremists ; for it was clear that none 
would like to contest the honour of the Congress Pre- 
sidentship with Dadabhai Nooroji. 

But though the question of the Presidentship of the 
Congress was thus settled to the satisfaction of the Mode- 
rates, the larger question still remained. " Should the 
Policy of the Congress be changed ? " (The Hon.) Mr. 
Khaparde, after full consultation with Mr. Tilak sent 
a Circular letter to leading Congressmen as early as July 
(1906) wherein he showed how a radical change had 
been necessitated in the programme of the Congress. 
The letter attracted considerable attention, specially 
in Anglo-Indian quarters. It was feared that the 
Congress would go out of the hands of the Moderates 
and so Anglo-Indian journals who had abused even 
Sir Henry Cotton and Mr. Gokhale as late as 1904 and 
1905 respectively, in a sudden burst of overflowing love, 
appealed to these very Congressmen not to play into 
the hands of the Extremists. Some of the Moderates 
themselves were scared away by Mr. Khaparde's letters. 
Regarding the main point suggested by the letter, Mr. 
Tilak said : — [Kesari nth December 1906). 

*' We are sometimes told not to be dis-heartened. If 
the Moderates think that we are easily disappointed and 
lack grim determination, they are entirely mistaken. 
We have lost faith, not in the ultimate result, but in 
the dilatory activities of the Congress. To us, the hold- 
ing of the Congress for three days in the year, the tepid 
work of the British Congress Committee and the 
occasional sending of a deputation to England-— 
seems quite an insufficient work. • Not that we 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 159 

liave no faith in ' Constitutional agitation/ We do 
not want to over-throw the Enghsh Government. 
Political rights will have to be fought for. The 
Moderates think that these can be won by 
persuasion. We think they can only be got by strong 
pressure. Will the Congress exert itself to apply this 
pressure ? That is the point ; and if such a pressure is 
to be applied, the Congress must leave this holiday cha- 
racter and develop into an organisation working con- 
tinuously and energetically." 

All India anxiously awaited to see how the Calcutta 
Congress would give its decision on this point. Anglo- 
India wanted also to see whether the differences of opi- 
nion between the Old and the New Parties would lead 
to open and permanent rupture. They wanted the 
Extremists to be driven out of the Congress. But this 
was an impossibility. In the first place, the Presiden- 
tial Chair was occupied by the Angel of Peace. Besides, 
Bengal was a strong-hold of the * Extremists ' and in 
the Congress session the New Party commanded a 
majority. The Presidential address was devoted to the 
theme of Swaraj. It, therefore, disappointed the 
Englishman vv^hich blamed Dadabhai who " being called 
upon to quench the flames of hatred towards the British 
Rule in India, had only used kerosine for that purpose." 
Mr. Tilak aided by Babu Bepin Chander Pal organised 
a private meeting of the Delegates of the New Party to 
discuss the subjects that the Congress should deal with ; 
and at this meeting it was decided to get the Congress 
adopt three distinct resolutions on (i) Swadeshi, (2) 
Boycott (3) and National Education. Of these, the last 
was passed by the Subjects' Committee without any 



l6o LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ado. The storm of discussion — hot and acrimonious — -- 
centred round the Boycott and the Swadeshi resolu- 
tions. At the Benares Congress, Boycott was accepted 
as a political weapon but only incidentally, in the reso- 
lution on the repressive policy of the Government. 
This was merely a flank movement. Mr. Tilak was not 
content with it. He wanted to make a frontal attack 
and after a prolonged controversy and frequent passa- 
ges at arms with Moderate leaders like Sir P. M. Mehta^ 
he wrung out the words " the Boycott movement was 
and is legitimate." At the Benares Congress it was 
only the " Boycott of British goods " that had received 
the seal of the Congress. Now, at Calcutta it was not 
merely *' economic Boycott " but something more. 
Boycott Political. At Benares no general reasons 
were given for the acceptance of Boycott. But 
at Calcutta, the mistake was rectified ; and the 
preamble to the resolution specifically referred 
to the fact that Indians had no share in the 
administration and that their representations to Go- 
vernment went unheeded. There was only one thing 
wanting in the resolution. The resolution approved of 
the Boycott Movement as started in Bengal ; it did not 
urge other provinces to follow suit. But Mr. Tilak 
pointed out that neither did the resolution clearly state 
that the Boycott was to be confined to Bengal alone. 

It is strange but true that in the draft resolution on 
Swadeshi, discussed in the Subjects' Committee, people 
were not called upon to purchase Swadeshi goods even at 
a sflcri^ce; stranger still that when Mr. Tilak brought the 
amendment, it was hastily pronounced to have been 
defeated. Mr. Tilak demanded a poll, which was re- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II l6r 

fused. As a protest, he had to leave the Subjects' 
Committee accompanied, by nearly sixty members in- 
cluding distinguished Nationalists like Mr. Pal and 
Babu Ashwini Kumar Dutt. Mr. Tilak wanted to move 
his amendment in the open Congress. Accordingly he 
sent notice thereof to the President, who, at last reali- 
sing the strength of Mr. Tilak's party accepted the 
amendment and bodily inserted it into the main propo- 
sition. Discord was thus timely averted and Mr.Tilakj 
speaking to the resolution declared that he was pleased 
to state that some ideas he favoured had been incorpo- 
rated in the resolution ; he further said that he was 
glad they had come to such a solution because the 
Anglo-Indians had predicted that the 22nd Congress 
would probably be the last ; he expressed his satisfac- 
tion that all differences had been squared, and that 
both the parties had approached the question in a spirit 
of conciliation and had met half way. 

Summarising the work of the Calcutta Congress, Mr. 
Tilak said : — 

" The Congress has now in effect laid down that 
Swaraj or Self-Govemment is the goal to be ultimately 
and gradually attained by the Nation and that, while 
the Nation may pray and petition to the Government 
as part of the constitutional agitation and seek the 
redress of grievances or the fruition of political aspira- 
tions, the Nation will mainly rely on its owti endeavours 
to accomplish the object. Swadeshi, Boycott, and 
National Education are the three most potent weapons 
given into our hands by the National Congress, and 
with these we must establish Swaraj." 

At Calcutta, Lala La j pat Rai had invited the Congress 
11 



l62 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to Lahore. But imagining that Napgur was a safer 
place, SirP; M. Mehta got the venue of the next Congress 
fixed at Nagpur. It is said that when the Moderate 
leaders left Calcutta, it was already arranged that Dr. 
Rash Behari Ghose was to be made President at Nagpur. 
In the various Provincial Conferences held in the first 
few months of 1907, attempts were made to go back 
upon the Calcutta Resolutions and thus prepare the 
ground for a retrograde step in December. In Bengal, 
happily there was no such attempt, as both the parties 
were suijiciently advanced and knew the value of unity. 
But in the Provincial Conference at Surat, Sir Pheroze- 
shah, taking advantage of Mr. Tilak's absence, tried to 
overawe the " Extremists '* and succeded in dropping 
the Resolutions on Boycott and National Education. 
In the Provincial Conference at Raipur (Berar), there 
was a serious dispute over the singing of such an inno- 
cent song, as the *' Bande Mataram "; and it was only 
the presence of Mr. Khaparde that compelled the 
Moderate leaders to give in. At Allahabad, Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya, who in the Calcutta Congress 
had declared that his province would not accept Boy- 
cott, refused admittance to about 200 Delegates to the 
Conference. He put forth the strange plea of inconve- 
nience but presumably he wanted to boycott the sup- 
porters of Boycott. All these signs showed how the 
Moderates were smarting under their " discomfiture " 
at Calcutta. At Nagpur, a Conference was held on 
January'' 27th, 1907, to appoint the Provincial Commit- 
tee which in its turn met on February 22nd to consti^ 
tute the Reception Committee. The new constitution 
of the Congress had practically delegated the work of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 163 

nominating the President of the forthcoming Congress 
to the Reception Commitee which by a majority of | 
had to select the President. It was, therefore, natural 
that the Moderates and the NationaUsts should try to 
secure greater representation for their Parties on the 
Reception Committee. Each party tried its level best 
to secure a majority and on September ist, it was found 
that while the Moderates had secured 800 Members, the 
Nationalists had got about 1800. Finding that Mr. 
Tilak could not be elected President, the Nationalist 
gave in only 26 names with-holding the long list of 1800 
together with the money (Rs. 45,000) collected at the 
rate of Rs. 25 per voter. The Moderates demanded this 
money and on the Nationalists refusing to give it, they 
proceeded to eject the Nationalist Members from the 
Executive Committee. This they had no right to do as 
the Executive Committee was already constituted 
months back. The Hon. Mr. Chitnavis called a meeting 
of the Reception Committee without consulting the 
Executive Committee or Dr. Munje, the joint General 
Secretary. The meeting (September 22nd, 1907) was a 
fiasco and the Hon. convener was the object of a hostile 
demonstration on the part of an angry mob. A compro- 
mise was attempted. Dr. Gour, himself a Moderate, 
proposed that the work of the Congress should begin 
with Rs. 20,000 collected by the Moderates from the 
800 enlisted members of the Reception Committee 
together with a loan of Rs. 5,000 from each party. 
The ; Moderates were obstinate. They were unwilling 
to allow the NationaUsts single-handed to hold the 
Congress Session at Nagpur ; they were unable or afraid 
to hold it themselves ; they, therefore, did the easiest 



164 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and most inglorious thing ; they reported to the All- 
India Congress Committee their inability to hold the 
Sessions of the Congress at Nagpur. A meeting of the 
All-India Congress Committee was held at Bombay on 
November loth, and there, in spite of the protests of 
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, in spite of the willingness 
of the Nagpur Nationalists to accept any compromise 
for the sake of the reputation of their City and Province, 
the venue of the Congress was changed to Surat, one of 
the strongholds of the Moderates. 

Alerady the people were in an angry mood. Repres- 
sion was at work in several part of India. Bombay was 
comparatively quiet. Far in the South, Rajmahendri, 
Cocoanada were seething with discontent. More im- 
portant still were the events in the Punjab, where the 
mistaken and short-sighted policy of the Bureaucracy 
in trying to pass into Acts two Bills — the Colonisation 
Bill and the Land Alienation Act Amendment Bill — - 
endangered the rights of the people over their lands 
and made the discontent acute. The abnormal increase 
of Land Revenue in the Rawalpindi District, the in- 
crease of the Canal rates on the Bari-Doab Canal, touch- 
ed the pockets of even the poorest cultivators and thus 
created a grave situation. The Editor and the Pro- 
prietor of the Punjabee were prosecuted and in May 
1907 Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar Ajit Singh were de- 
ported. This deportation created a storm of indigna- 
tion and convinced the country of its helplessness in 
defending its birth-rights. In Bengal, the Editor of 
Yugantar was sent to goil. The Editor of the 
Sandhya refused to conduct his defence because " he 
did not think that in carrying on the God-appointed 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 165 

^anission of Swaraj he was in any way responsible to the 
aUen rulers." Babu Arabindo Ghosh was arrested on 
a charge of sedition, and on November ist, 1907 the 
Seditious Meetings Act was passed, despite the opposi- 
tion of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale and of the Hon, Mr. Rash 
Behari Ghosh, and it was rumoured that the liberty of 
Press was also on the point of being taken away. 

On November nth, 1907, Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar 
Ajit Singh were released. This news, welcome in each 
respect, tended to make the Congress " confusion worse 
confounded." At once, as if by instict, the cry went 
round that Lajpat Rai was the fittest man to preside. 
At Surat on November 21st, the Reception Committee 
was formed and the office bearers of the Congress were 
appointed. To prevent many of the Congress-men in 
Maharashtra from attending the meeting, it was an- 
nounced that the Presidential Election would be made 

•on November 24th. Though thus out-manoeuvred, the 
young Nationalists of Surat and adjoining places 
stoutly suggested the name of Lala Lajpat Rai for the 
Presidential post. Mr. Gokhale argued, coaxed, ap- 
pealed ; and when every device proved unavailing, he 
removed the velvet glove from off his mailed list, and 
challenged the younger Nationalists to secure Lala 
Lajpat Rai's election in the face of the packed majority 
of the Moderates. The Nationalists were in a fix. 
They could not allow the Hero of the hour to be humi- 
liated by the unworthy tactics of the Moderates. Silent- 
ly and sullenly they allowed Dr. Rash Behari Ghose to 
be ' unaniomously ' elected President. 

The selection of Dr. Ghose for the Presidential chair 
-was only part of a wider plan of going back upon the 



l66 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

position accepted at Calcutta and of permanentlj?? 
shutting out the ' Extremists ' from all future sessions- 
of the Congress. The Indu Prakash and the Indian: 
Social Reformer clearly hinted this purpose and the 
whole conduct of the Moderate leaders all over India 
in the eventful months of 1907 clearly strengthens this 
belief. It was the duty of the Moderates and especial- 
ly that of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale who was entrusted 
with the work of drafting the resolutions to publicly 
declare if this belief was incorrect and unfounded.* 
A list of the headings of the subjects likely to be 
taken up for discussion by the Surat Congress 
was of&cicially published a week or ten days 
before the date of the Congress Sessions. This list did 
not include the subjects of Self-Go vemment, Boycottp 
National Education on all of which distinct and sepa- 
rate resolutions were passed at Calcutta in 1906. This- 
omission naturally strengthened the suspicion that the. 
Bombay Moderates really intended to go back from the 
position taken up by the Calcutta Congress in these 
matters. The Press strongly commented upon this 
omission and Mr. Tilak, who reached Surat on the morn- 
ing of the 23rd December, denounced such retrogres- 
sion as suicidal in the interests of the countrj^ more, 
especially at the present juncture, and appealed to the 
Surat public to help the Nationalists in their endeavours. 
to maintain at least the status quo in these matters. 
The next day, a Conference of about five hundred 
Nationalist Delegates was held at Surat under the 
Chairmanship of Shrijut Arabindo Ghose, where it was. 

* We are indebted for the bulk of the contents of the next 
8 Pages to the closely-reasoned document published by th©- 
Nationalist Leaders soon after the break-up of the Congress. 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 167 

decided that the NationaUsts should prevent the at- 
tempted retrogression of the Congress by all Constitu- 
tional means even by opposing the election of the Pre- 
sident, if necessary ; and a letter was written to the 
Congress Secretaries requesting them to make arrange- 
ments for dividing the house, if need be, on every con- 
tested proposition, including that of election of the 
President. 

In the meanwhile, a press-note was issued by the Re- 
ception Committee to the effect that the statement that 
certain resolutions adopted in 1906 were omitted from 
the Congress Programme prepared by the Surat Recep- 
tion Committee was wholly unfounded ; but the draft 
resolutions themselves were still with-held from the 
public ; on the morning of the 25th December, Mr. 
Tilak happened to get a copy of the draft of the propos- 
ed Constitution of the Congress prepared by the Hon. 
Mr. Gokhale. In this draft, the object of the Congress 
was thus stated : " The Indian National Congress 
has for its ultimate goal, the attainment by India 
of Self-Government similar to that enjoyed by the 
other members of the British Empire. Mr. Tilak, 
addressing a meeting of the Delegates the same morn- 
ing, at the Congress Camp, explained how this Consti- 
tution was devised to exclude the Nationalists from the 
Congress by making the acceptance of this new creed 
an indispensable condition of the Congress membership. 
Mr. Tilak further stated in plain terms, that if they 
were assured that no sliding back of the Congress would 
be attempted, the opposition to the election of the Pre- 
sident would be withdrawn. The Delegates at the 
meeting were asked to sign a letter to Dr. Ghose re- 



l68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

questing him to take up the four old resolutions for re- 
affirmation. 

Lala Lajpat Rai who arrived at Surat on the morn- 
ing of 25th, saw Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde in the 
afternoon and intimated to them his intention to ar- 
range for a Committee of a few leading Delegates from 
each side to settle the question in dispute. Messrs. 
Tilak and Khaparde having agreed, he went to Mr. 
Gokhale to arrange for the Committee if possible ; and 
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde returned to the Nationa- 
list Conference which was held that evening. At this 
Conference, a Nationalist Committee consisting of one 
Nationalist Delegate from each Province was appointed 
to earry on the negotiations with the other side ; and it 
was decided that if the Nationalist Committee failed 
to obtain any assurance from the responsible Congress 
Officials about status quo being maintained, the Nationa- 
lists should begin their opposition from the election of 
the President. For the retrogression of the Congress 
was a serious step, not to be decided upon by a bare 
accidental majority of any party either in the Subjects' 
Committee or in the whole Congress as then constitu- 
ted, and the usual acceptance of the President would 
have under such circumstances greatly weakened the 
point and force of the opposition. No kind of intima- 
tion was received from Lala Lajpat Rai on the night 
of the 25th, or the morning of the 26th December re- 
garding the proposal of a joint Committee of reconcili- 
ation proposed by him, nor was a copy of the draft reso- 
lutions supplied to Mr. Tilak or any delegates to enable 
them to judge if sHding back from the old position was 
really intended. 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 169 

On the morning of the 26th December, Mr. Tilak and 
the other NationaHst leaders went to Babu Surendra- 
Nath Banerjea at his residence, and informed him that 
the NationaHst opposition to the election of the Presi- 
dent would be withdrawn if (i) the Nationalist Party 
were assured that the Status quo would not be disturbed, 
and (2) if some graceful allusion was made by any one 
of the speakers on the resolution about the election of 
the President, to the desire of the public to have Lala 
Lajpat Rai in the chair. Mr. Bannerjea agreed to the 
latter proposal as he said he was himself to second the 
resolution ; while as regards the first, though he gave 
an assurance foi himself and Bengal, he asked Mr. 
Tilak to see Mr. Gokhale or Mr. Malvi, the Chairman of 
the Reception Committee. A volunteer was accord- 
ingly sent in a carriage to invite Mr. Malvi to Mr. Ban- 
erjea's residence, but the volunteer brought a reply 
that Mr. Malvi had no time to come as he was engaged 
in religious practices. Mr. Tilak then returned to his 
Camp to take his meals as it was already about 11 a.m.; 
but on returning to the Congress Pandal one hour later, 
he made persistent attempts to get access to Mr. Malvi 
but could not find him anywhere. A little before 
2-30 P.M., a word was brought to Mr. Tilak that Mr. 
Malvi was in the President's tent, and Mr. Tilak sent a 
message to him from an adjoining tent asking for a 
short interview. Mr. Malvi replied that he could not 
see Mr. Tilak as the Presidential procession was being 
formed. 

These facts will explain the position of the two par- 
lies, when the Congress commenced its proceedings on 
Thursday the 26th December, at 2-30 P.M. No assur- 



170 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ance from any responsible official of the Congress about 
the maintenance of the Status quo being obtained, Mr^ 
Tilak sent a slip to Babu Surendranath,initimatingthat 
he should not make the proposed allusion to Lala 
Lajpat Rai in his speech. He also requested Mr. Malvi 
to supply him with a copy of the draft resolutions, if 
ready, and about 3. p.m. he got it, though the reporter 
of the Advocate of India got it on the previous day. 

The Congress opened with the address of Mr. Malvi, 
the Chairman of the Reception Committee. After the 
address was over, Dewan Bahadur Ambalal Sakarlal 
proposed Dr. Ghose to the Chair in a speech, which, 
though evoking occasional cries of dissent, was heard' 
to the end. The declaration by the Dewan Bahadur 
as well as by Mr. Malvi that the proposing and second- 
ing of the resolution to elect the President was only a 
formal matter, led many to believe that it was not im- 
probable that the usual procedure of taking votes on 
the proposition might be dispensed with. And when 
Babu Surendranath, whose rising on the platform 
seems to have reminded many of the Midnapur Con- 
ference where he was instrumental in getting the Na- 
tionalist party headed by Srij. Arabindo Ghose practi- 
cally ejected with Police aid, commenced his speech, 
there was persistent shouting and he was asked to sit 
down. In spite of his numerous efforts, he could not 
go on and so the Session had to be suspended for the 
day. It is unjust to suggest that this hostile demons- 
tration was pre-arranged by the Nationalists as what 
they had decided to do was silently and solidly to vote 
against the election. 

At about 8 P.M., the late Mr. Chunilal Saraya, Mana- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 17I 

ger of the Indian Specie Bank and Vice-Chairman of the 
Surat Reception Committee, accompanied by two other 
gentlemen, went in his un-ofhcial Capacity and on his 
own account, to Mr. Tilak and proposed that he intended' 
to arrange for a meeting that night between Mr. Tilak 
and Mr. Gokhale at the residence of a leading Con- 
gressman to settle the diSerences. Mr. Tilak agreed 
and requested Mr. Chunilal if an interview could be 
arranged, to fix the time in consultation with Mr. Gokhale 
adding that he (Mr. Tilak) would be glad to be present 
at the place of the interview at any hour of the night. 
Thereupon, Mr. Chunilal left Mr. Tilak, but no word 
from him was received by the latter that night. 

On the morning of Friday the 27th, (iia.m.) Mr. 
Chunilal Saraya again saw Mr. Tilak and requested him 
to go in company with Mr. Khaparde to Prof. Gaj jar's 
bungalow near the Congress pandal where, by appoint- 
ment, they were to meet Dr. Rutherford, M.P., who 
was trying for a reconciliation. Messrs. Tilak and 
Khaparde went to Prof. Gaj jar's, but Dr. Rutherford 
could not come there owing to other engagements. 
Mr. Tilak then decided, as no settlement was arrived 
at privately owing to every leading Congressman 
being unwilling to take am^ responsibility in the 
matter upon himself, to propose that the business of the 
election of the President should be adjourned and a 
Committee of one leading Moderate and one leading 
Nationalist from each Congress Province wdth Dr. 
Rutherford's name added, be appointed to consider and 
settle the differences existing between the two parties, 
both of which should accept the Committee's decision 
as final and then proceed to the unanimous election of 



172 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the President. Prof. Gajjar and Mr. Chunilal under- 
took to convey the proposal to Sir P. M. Mehta or Dr. 
Rutherford in the Congress Camp ; after half an hour 
they returned and told Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde 
that nothing could be done in the matter. 

It was about 12-30 at this time and on the receipt of 
the above reply, Mr. Tilak wrote the following note to 
Mr Malvi, Chairman of the Reception Committee : — 

Sir, — I wish to address the delegates on the proposal 
of the election of the President after it is seconded. I 
wish to move an adjournment with a constructive 
proposal. Please announce me. 

Yours Sincerely, 
B. G. TILAK. 
Deccan Delegate {Poona). 
The proceedings of the day commenced at i P.M., 
when Babu Surendranath was called upon to resume 
Ms speech seconding the election of the President. 
Babu Surendranath was calmly heard by all and he 
duly finished his speech. As Mr. Tilak got no reply to 
his note, he sent a reminder. Still Mr. Malvi was 
silent. Mr. Tilak, therefore, proceeded to go up the 
platform immediately after Babu Surendranath. But 
he was held back by a Volunteer. Mr. Tilak, however, 
asserted his right to go up and succeeded in getting 
to the platform just when Dr. Ghose was moving to 
take the President's chair. It is not true that " by 
the time Mr. Tilak came upon the platform and 
stood in front of the President, the motion of the 
election of Dr. Ghose had been passed." As Mr. Tilak 
stood up on the platform he was greeted with shouts of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II I73 

disapproval from the members of the Reception Com- 
mittee on the platform and the cry was taken up by 
other Moderates. Mr. Tilak repeatedly insisted upon 
his right of addressing the delegates and told Dr. Ghose 
when he attempted to interfere that he was not pro- 
perly elected. Mr. Malvi said that he had ruled Mr. 
Tilak'samendmentoutof order, to which Mr. Tilak replied 
that the ruling, if any, was wrong and that he had a 
right to appeal to the delegates on the same. By this 
time, there was a general uproar in the Pandal, the 
Moderates shouting at Mr. Tilak and asking him to 
sit down, and the Nationalists demanding that he 
should be heard. At this stage, Dr. Ghose and Mr. 
Malvi said that Mr. Tilak should be removed from the 
platform ; and a young gentleman holding the impor- 
tant office of a Secretary to the Reception Committee 
touched Mr. Tilak 's person with a view to carry out 
the Chairman's order. Mr. Tilak pushed the gentle- 
man aside and again asserted his right of being heard, 
declaring that he would not leave the platform, unless 
bodil}' removed. At this stage, Mr. Gokliale asked the 
above-mentioned gentleman not to touch Mr. Tilak's 
person. But there were others who were seen threat- 
ening an assault on his person, though he was calmly 
standing on the platform facing the delegates with his 
arms folded over his chest. 

It was during this confusion that a shoe, hurled on 
to the platform hit Sir P. M. Mehta on the side of his 
face after touching Babu Surendranath Banerjea, both 
of whom were sitting within a yard of Mr. Tilak on the 
other side of the table. Chairs were now seen being 
lifted to be thrown at Mr. Tilak by persons on and 



174 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

below the platform and some of the Nationalists, there- 
fore, rushed on to the platform to his rescue. Dr. 
Ghose in the meanwhile twice attempted to read his 
address but was stopped by cries of * No, No ' from all 
sides in the Pandal and the confusion became still 
worse. It was now found impossible to arrest the pro- 
gress of disorder and the proceedings were then suspen- 
ded sine die. 

Dr. Ghose's speech, though undelivered in the Con- 
gress Pandal, had been by this time published in the 
Calcutta papers and telegrams from Calcutta, received 
in the evening, showed that in the speech he had made 
an offensive attack on the Nationalist Party. This 
added to the sensation in the Nationalist Camp that 
evening but the situation was not such as to preclude 
all hope of reconciliation. Shrijut Motilal Ghose, Mr. A. 
C. Mitra, Mr. B. C. Chatterjee and Lala Harkisen Lai 
tried their best to bring about a compromise and if 
possible to have the Congress Session revived the next 
day. They went to Mr. Tilak on the night of the 27th 
and the morning of the 28th to ascertain the views of 
his party and to each of them Mr. Tilak gave the fol- 
lowing assurance in writing : — 

SuRAT, 2Sth December, 1907. 

Dear Sir ; — With reference to our conversation and 
principally in the best interests of the Congress, I and 
my party are prepared to waive our opposition to the 
election of Dr. Rash Behari as President of the 
23rd Indian National Congress, and we are prepared 
to act in the spirit of forget and forgive provided, firstly 
the last year's resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott 
and National Education are adhered to and each ex- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II I75 

pressly re-afi&rmed, and secondly such passages, if any, 
in Dr. Ghose's speech as may be offensive to the 
Nationalist Party, are omitted." 

Your's etc., 

B. G. TILAK. 

This letter was taken by the gentleman to whom it 
was addressed to the Moderate leaders but no compro- 
mise was arrived at, as the Moderates were all along 
bent upon the retrogression of the Congress at any cost. 
A Convention of the Moderates was, therefore, held, in 
the Pandal, the next day, where the Nationalists were 
not allowed to go, even when some of them were ready 
and offered to sign the declaration required. On the 
other hand, those, who did not wish to go back 
from the position taken up at the Calcutta Congress and 
honestly desired to work further on the same lines, met 
in a separate place the same evening to consider what 
steps might be taken to continue the work of the 
Congress in future. Thus ended the proceedings 
of the 23rd Indian National Congress amidst 
confusion and in bitterness, leaving the parties 
more estranged than ever, thus making easy the 
task of those who were unfriendly to the cause of 
Indian freedom. 

Let us now examine a little minutely Mr. Tilak's 
contention, that the Congress autocrats were bent upon 
a retrograde step by tampering with the four Calcutta 
resolutions, on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott and National 
Education. These resolutions had been unanimously 
accepted at Calcutta after a long and heated discussion 
between the leaders of both the parties. Resolutions 



176 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

like these passed as a compromise between two parties 
could not be altered even in the drafts by any one only 
because that gentleman has been entrusted with the 
work of drafting the Congress Resolutions. At the 
Calcutta Congress (1906) it was resolved that the sys- 
tem of Government obtaining in the Self-Governing 
British Colonies should be extended to India ; at Surat 
though this resolution was almost repeated still this was 
set up as the ultimate goal, evidently meaning that it 
was to be considered as out of the pale of practical 
politics. What offended the Nationalists still more 
was the draft constitution of the Congress in which the 
goal of the Congress was defined as follows : — 

'* The Indian National Congress has for its ultimate 
goal the attainment by India of self-government 
similar to that enjoyed by other members of the 
British Empire * * *. It seeks to advance towards- 
this goal b}^ strictly constitutional means, by 
bringing about a steady reform of the existing 
system of administration * * *." 
So then, the reform of the existing system of adminis- 
tration and not its gradual replacement by a popular 
system v<^as to be the immediate object of the Congress. 
The sting of this seemingly innocent constitution lay 
in the fact that it sought to convert the National Con- 
gress into a party organisation. As the acceptance of 
this creed was the condition of the membership of the 
Congress, the Bengal ' Extremists ' who had repudiated 
the ideal of Colonial Self-Government were to be shut 
out of the Congress. When the goal of the Bengal 
* Extremists * viz, " Independence (absolute autonomy) 
by peaceful means" was declared perfectly legal not 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II V]f 

only by the Law Courts* of Bengal but also by Lord 
Morley, what right had the Moderates to shut out an 
important and law-abiding section of Indian poli- 
ticians from the Congress ? Mr. Tilak has been 
often blamed for " coquetting with the views 
of the Bengal School of Extremist politicians " — 
these are Mr. Gokhale's words — but though four 
or five times at the most, in 1907-08 he has defended 
the ideal of his Bengal colleagues and followers y 
still he has consistently preached the ideal set up by 
Dadabhai Naoroji. If this is to be called inconsistency, 
what shaU we say of those who at Calcutta accepted 
without demur the National Education Resolution, and 
who at the very next Provincial Conference at Surat 
declared that they did not understand what National 
Education meant ? 

The draft resolution about the ' Swadeshi movement * 
did not contain the words * even at a sacrifice.' Mr. 
Gokhale later explained that this omission was * unin- 
tentional ' and we readily accept his word but the effect 
of this omission was that the very soul of the resolution 
was taken out. 

Mr. Gokhale has admitted that the changes made by 
him in the Boycott resolution were intentional. He 

* As late as 1909, Mr. Beachcroft, the Judge who tried Srj. 
Arabindo Ghose and the Maniktola conspirators in the Ahpore 
Bomb Case wrote in his judgment " Independence is an ideal 
with which no true Englishman would quarrel." This judicial 
pronouncement was specially significant in view of the fact that 
Srj. C. R. Das, Counsel for Srj . Arabindo Ghose had repeatedly 
declared on behalf of his client that if preaching independence 
was a crime, Srj. Ghose was willing to suffer any punishment 
that might be awarded to him.

declared that they were rendered necessasy by the 
unfair and unjustifiable attempt made by Bapu Bepin 
Chunder Pal from the Congress platform in 1906 and 
by Mr. Tilak and others in the Press throughout 
1907, to construe the phraseology employed in the 
Calcutta resolution as approving Boycott of all forms 
of association with the Government. Now, what 
is the exact wording of the Calcutta resolution ? 
After recounting the reasons, the Congress declared 
that " the Boycott movement inaugurated in Bengal 
was and is justifiable." Mr. Gokhale in his draft 
resolution changed the wording from *' Boycott 
movement " to the " Boycott of foreign (British) 
goods." As Babu Bepin Chunder Pal said " We in 
Eastern Bengal and Assam have not only tried to 
boycott British goods , but all honorary offices and 
association with Government " and the words' 1" Boy- 
cott Movement" were comprehensive enough to include 
these phases of Boycott while the wording adopted by 
Mr, Gokhale was evidently narrow. 

Regarding the last resolution, the Calcutta Congress 
said " the time has arrived for the people earnestly to 
take up the question of National Education * * and to 
organise a system of education * * on National lines 
and under National control." Mr. Gokhale's draft 
concluded with the words " organize an indepen(^ent 
system of education," thus leaving the very vital words 
" on National lines and under National control." Mr. 
Gokhale might have thought that verbal changes were 
made here and there to remove ambiguity or to improve 
the phraseology. Is it not, however, wiser to retain a 
phraseology, however defective from the literary stand-

point than endanger the peace and harmony of the 
Congress ? But if these changes were really vital — as 
has been clearly shown — is it not proper to put the 
whole responsibility of the Surat episode on the heads 
of those Congress autocrats who, for the sake of a petty 
scheme of administrative reforms were willing to dis» 
card the friendship of their political colleagues and 
create a situation which made it easy for the Bureau* 
cracy to " make short work of the Extremists "?

question is " whose conduct was unconstitutional and 
un-Parliamentary ?" 

Mr. Tilak sends to the Chairman of the Congress 
Reception Committee a notice of adjournment with a 
constructive proposal. Writers on constitutional law 
hold that " a motion for adjourning the debate may be 
offered at any period of the discussion. Dr. Smith,* 
the great English authority on the subject remarks that 
on such occasions " the Chairman will feel bound to

put it (i.e. the motion of adjournment) to the vote." 
Mr. Malvi merely * thinks ' it to be * irregular and out 
of order '. Mr. Tilak asserts his right to speak. He is 
not allowed to proceed. The Chairman is anxious to 
gag him. TheTresident is impatient to read his address. 
Confusion drowns the rest. 

Regarding the diplomatic hurry shown by the Con- 
gress authorities in declaring Dr. Ghose duly elected, 
we may note that such incidents are by no means rare. 
Let Dr. Smith speak : — 

" Sometimes, especially at meetings, where the Chair- 
man and the party appointing him are anxious to have 
a certain resolution carried and wish to remove every 
opportunity for opposition to it, the Chairman will in- 
sist upon putting it to the vote, the moment it is moved 
and seconded ; and although some member claims to be 
heard before the votes are completely taken, the Chair- 
man goes on taking the votes and then tells the member 
that the question is now decided and he cannot speak 
to it because it is not before the meeting. In such a 
• case, the member should of course endeavour to attract 
the Chairman's attention in a way which the latter can- 
not ignore, and may then proceed to speak in spite of 
the Chairman." 

Mr. Tilak's views on the relations between the 
Moderates and the Nationalists are sound and refresh- 
ing. He says* : — 

" Both the Moderates and the Nationahsts must 
remember that persons belonging to both the parties 
are actuated by a sincere desire to promote the welfare 
-of he country; and that none is deliberately working to 

♦The Kesari, 



tSz LOKAMANYA TDLAK 

bring about the ruin of the country. If both parties start 
mth this assumption, if both are wilhng to accept the 
existence of difference of opinions as inevitable, and as 
constituting a healthy sign in the body poUtic, there 
would be less room for misunderstandings. Both the 
parties should realise that only in Unity there is safety 
and that this unity they have to keep in spite of acute 
differences of opinion. Neither should try to stamp 
out the other and both should, while exerting their 
utmost to get the upper hand in the National assemblies 
conducted by the united efforts of the Moderates and 
the Nationalists, never abuse their supremacy by try- 
ing to crush or cripple their opponents in the other 
party. The Moderates should remember that it 
is because the New Party has come into existence 
that the Bureaucracy condescends to " rally " themo 
The Nationahsts must understand that though the 
caution and hesitation of the Moderates is often galling 
to them, still their influence and prestige is not to be 
despised. If these are the advantages, which one gets 
from the other, there are some inevitable disadvantages 
also. The Nationahsts have generally to bear the 
brunt of poUtical fight, but the rewards of the poUtical 
warfare go invariably to the Moderates. By their asso- 
ciation with the Nationalists, the Moderates do sometime 
receive official taunts and frowns. When taken to taskp 
the Moderates must however poiut-black tell the autho- 
rities that though they differ in many important res- 
pects from the * Extremists *, still, so long as the latter 
are willing to co-operate with them, they would not 
part company. True, some of the Nationahsts have 
set up " Independence " as the ultimate goal of theht 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 183 

ambition ; but even Lord Morley does not find any- 
thing illegal in such " faiths and aspirations." True, 
also that some of the Nationalists preach boycott which 
is more than a boycott of British goods, still there is 
nothing wrong in the Moderates co-operating to the 
point both the parties are agreed. If these points are 
kept in mind, the unity between the two parties will be 
ever-lasting" . 

In contrast with these statesman-like utterances.lread 
the following petulant and short-sighted remarks of 
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose : — 

" The Extremist Party is an ominous shadow, which 
has projected itself over the future fortunes of the 

country It has no place in the pale of the 

Congress. Secession, therefore, is the only course 
open to it. (Turning to his brother Extremists, Dr. 
Ghose said) you may deny it, but I fear, you are in 
danger, slowly but surely of drifting into 
treason. "•!■ 

Immediately on his return to Poona from Surat, Mr. 
Tilak commenced collecting funds for starting a Nation- 
alist Daily (Marathi). The Paper — Rashtra-Mat — came 
out in June (1908) and in its very short career, justified 
its existence by bravely fighting for the National cause. 
About the end of February (1908) Mr. Tilak started on, 
what he intended to make, a long tour throughout aU 

"^ Undelivered Presidential Address. Since the above lines 
were written. Dr. Ghose, alas, has passed away. He lived to 
nnderstand and appreciate the Nationalists and to recognise 
their place in the National Movement. Indeed, it may be con- 
fidently said that latterly, Dr. Ghose's agreed more with the 
views of Mr, Tilak than with those of his own " friend and 
master" the Hon. Sir Surendranath Banerjea. 



184 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Marathi-speaking districts of the Presidency in order 
to collect about five lakhs of rupees to put the Samartha 
Vidyalaya, the well-known National School on a sound 
basis. He went first to Sholapur and then to Barsi. 
He was extremely well-received and he collected a sum 
of Rs. 50,000. He had, however, to return to Bombay 
to give evidence (9th March) before the Royal Com- 
mission of Decentrahsation. The work of the Poona 
District Conference (20th, 21st, and 22nd March) 
then claimed his attention. Then came the work 
of organising the picketing at the liquor shops. 
This movement lasted for about a month. Then he 
attended the Provincial Conference at Dhulia. To top 
all, came the bomb (30th April), changing the poHtical 
atmosphere in its entirety. It threw the shadow of 
misfortune and failure over every public activity. The 
Samartha-Vidyalaya was subsequently suppressed by 
the Government (1910). 

Mr, Tilak's pithy and closely-reasoned evidence before 
the Decentralization Commission concluded thus : — 

" The mere shifting of the centre of power and autho- 
rity from one official to another is not, in my opinion 
calculated to restore the feelings of cordiality between 
the officers and the people, prevailing in earlier days. 
English Education has created new aspirations and 
ideals amongst the people and so long as these national 
aspirations remain unsatisfied, it is useless to expect 
that the hiatus between the officers and the people 
could be removed by any scheme of official Decentraliz- 
ation. In is no remedy — not even a palliative against the 
evil complained of, nor was it put forward by the people 
or their leaders. The fluctuating wave of Decentralize 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 185 

-mtion may infuse more or less life in the individual 
members of the Bureaucracy, but it cannot remove the 
growing estrangement between the rulers and the 
ruled, unless and until the people are allowed more and 
more effective voice in the management of their own 
affairs in an ever expansive spirit of wise liberalism and 
wide sympathy, aiming at raising India to the level of 
Self-Go verning countries." 

The Poona District Conference, which met on 20th, 
2 1st and 22nd March, 1908 bespeaks the resource- 
fulness, patience, tact and the organizing power of Mr. 
Tilak. Immediately on his return from Surat, while 
the dust of controversy still darkened all quarters, he 
sent round his lieutenants all over the district and 
established Taluka Associations. Two months of pro- 
poganda work left nothing to be desired either in the 
thoroughness of the preparations or in the representa- 
tive character of the delegates who attended the Con- 
ference from different parts of the district. But that 
the Moderates should have, so soon after the breach at 
Surat stood on the same political platform with Mr. 
Tilak is as great a compliment to their good sense as 
to Mr. Tilak's tact in managing men. Perhaps the 
Moderates felt it their duty to accept what they might 
have thought to be Mr. Tilak's challenge and so they 
mustered strong. They must, however, have been 
surprised to find the intellectual tenacity and political 
zeal of the delegates hailing from the nooks and corners 
of the district. The late Rao Bahadur Joshi, the famous 
Statistician, was the President. Fourteen Resolutions 
were passed. One of them appealed to the leaders of 
the various parties to sink, differences and restore 



l86 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

unity in the National Congress. Another resolution 
advocated the Swadeshi and Boycott movement ; an 
attempt was made to substitute the words " boycott of 
foreign goods ** for the words ** the Boycott movement" 
but it met with a miserable failure. A resolution on 
National Education was also passed and a strong Com- 
mittee was appointed to work it out. Most of the re- 
solutions were mandates to the people and not appeals 
to the Government. " Self-reliance, no mendicancy ** 
was the watch- word of this Conference. It was resol- 
ved to take steps to encourage sugar mdustry in Poona;. 
to make an industrial survey of the district, to start at 
least 25 primary schools during the course of one year, 
to encourage arbitration and discourage liquor. Alto- 
gether a nice programme of work, unluckily required to 
be totally shelved by the coming of the bomb. 

It was a nice and most inspiring speech that Mr. Tilak 
delivered in the District Conference on the " Evils of 
Drink." He ridiculed the idea of carrying on "a 
Temperance propaganda " by means of magic lantern 
performances and like otlier methods. These methods 
according to him, were «!dl right in countries having the 
hereditary poison of drink in their blood. But where^ 
as in India, morality, religion, social opinion, instinct 
and heredity were strongly against the use of 
liquor, picketing was the only way to rouse indivi- 
dual, social as well as the Abkari conscience. ^ He 
wound up his speech with an impassioned appeal to the 
young men sitting opposite in the gallery. The effect 
was electric. A band of youths formed themselves 
into a Volunteer corps and spontaneously started peaceful 
picketing before the principle liquor-shops of Poona. It 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 187 

would be a mistake to suppose, that this movement 
was merely impulsive. Years since, it had been in ex- 
istence ; the Swadeshi movement, which in its wider 
significance was a movement for the reconstruction of 
the National Life, made it powerful. EspeciaUy in 
Thana, Belgaum and Ahmednagar, systematic efforts 
had been made to check the evil of drink. It was, 
however, reserved, for the picketng movement to make 
*' Temperance " which in Indian Vernaculars always 
means total abstinence, a hve issue. Within less than 
a fortnight, it was estimated that the sale of liquor in 
Poona City was aU but stopped. It was impossible 
that the keepers of the liquor shops would take this 
agitation lying down. They tried their best to put 
obstacles in the way of the Volunteers. But cautious, 
tactful and well-disciplined that the volunteers were, 
they worked in spite of rebufifs, insults and provoca- 
tions. The experiences of the Swadeshi picketing at 
Calcutta had taught them not to court any coUision 
with the Police ; and in their well-meant efforts, they 
could rely upon the support and advice of three differ- 
ent sections of people, the Nationalists, the Moderates 
and Loyahsts of the type of Dr. Mann and the Rev. Mr. 
MacNickel the purity of whose motives at least was sO 
far as the Bureaucrats were concerned beyond question. 
The Volunteers worked under the direct supervision of 
the Poona Temperance Society, whose members, be- 
sides framing stringent rules for the observance of the 
Volunteers took special care to see that those rules were 
scrupulously observed. The Volunteers were selected 
after careful inquiry ; the work they were set to do was 
<:arefully apportioned. They were strictly directed to 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 



preach peacef^lly and modestly to persons entering the 
liquor shops. On no account were they to use intimi- 
dation or force. A deputation consisting of the Hon. Mr. 
Gokhale, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and others 
waited on the then Collector of Poona to discuss the 
rules and it is said that in accordance with some of his 
suggestions, certain changes were introduced therein ; 
and still as ill-luck would have it, in spite of every care, 
caution and foresight exercised, more than 40 Volun- 
teers out of about 150 working in the City were hauled 
up before the Magistrate and convicted and fined for 
having disobeyed orders of the Police. Technically 
they were offenders ; for the Police had ordered them 
to stop picketing, which they had refused to do. 
Undoubtedly, the Policeman has got the power to 
order any person to quit a place where he is standing 
on a public street. But where such an order is given 
tDnly to disallow a peaceful citizen from doing a peaceful 
legitimate and philanthrophic duty, conscientious per- 
sons will feel bound to dis-obey such orders. In this con- 
nection, it should be remembered that in Europe and 
America, pickets are allowed even to enter liquor-shops 
and there do their work. 

The movement spread like-fire in the whole of Maha- 
rashtra and in the enthusiasm .that it awakened, even 
Swadeshi and Boycott were for a time forgotten. But 
the custodians of law and order, afraid that it would 
lead to disorder, took early steps to " suppress picket- 
ing." At Lonavla (near Poona) the District Magistrate 
issued an order (nth April 1908) under Section 144 of 
the Criminal Procedure Code, enjoining people not to 

congregate and loiter daily in the vicinity of the coun* 



.'(( 



TOWARDS REPRESSION iSg. 

try liquor shops at Karla and Lonavla with the purpose 
of preventing customers from entering the shops." The 
Magistrate wanted to save " persons lawfully resorting" 
to the liquor-shops from annoyance. On or about 
April 17th, instructions were issued to the Poona 
Police to suppress the movement. 

On April 23rd, a huge meeting of about 12,000 persons 
was held, under the Presidency of Dr. Bhandarkar to 
protest against the high-handedness of the District 
Magistrate and to devise means of continuing the work 
thus interrupted. A deputation consisting of Dr. 
Bhandarkar, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and 
others was appointed to meet the Governor who received 
members of the Deputation (In the mean-while Mr. 
Tilak was arrested on June 24th, 1908) on July 6th, 
1908. After expressing his general sympathy with the 
Temperance Movement, His Excellency Sir George Clarke 
(Now Lord Sydenham) explained the Government's 
policy with regard to the sale of liquor, took exception 
to certain statements made by the members of the 
Deputation and concluded by saying that though the 
rules made by the Association were unexceptionable, 
still it was impossible owing to the difference in indivi- 
dual temperaments to expect uniform and consistent 
observance of them. He reminded the deputation, 
how, even at Poona, the rules failed to keep order and 
how therefore, their universal application was fraught 
with evil consequences. He concluded " Picketing is 
an interference with liberty which in Poona, certainly 
would have the appearance of class legislation, that it 
would in many places inevitably lead to breaches of 
peace and to police prosecutions which we all wish to 



IQO LOKAMANYA TELAK 

avoid, that it cannot permanently promote the object 
you have in view and that it may help to defeat that 
object. I sincerely hope, you will not regard this as 
an arbitrary decision of an alien Government which 
does not sympathise with your valuable Association.*'. . 

A sadder commentary on the incapacity of the Bureau- 
cracy to understand the Indian view-point and a 
stronger argument for the immediate establishment of 
Swaraj can hardly be imagined. 

While engaged in these and other activities Mr. Tilak 
had not forgotten the question of the Congress-compro- 
mise. The first time that this problem was tackled 
since the Surat solit w£is at the Provincial Conference 
of United Bengal held in February 1908 at Pabna under 
the Presidency of Srj. (Dr.) Rabindranath Tagore. In 
this Conference, both the parties were strongly repre- 
sented and after full and mature consideration, the 
Calcutta Resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott 
and National Education were passed. The resolution 
on the Boycott did not speak merely of the Boycott of 
British goods but referred to the Boycott Movement — 
words Mr, Gokhale had taken strong objection to at 
Surat — and it is remarkable that though in the Swaraj 
resolution, demand was made only for Colonial Self- 
Govemment still, the Nationalists were allowed to bring 
in a formal amendment expressive of their longing for ab- 
solute Independence. The harmony that prevailed bet- 
ween the Bengal Moderates and the Bengal Nation- 
alists on such heated subjects as Boycott and Self- 
Government was of happy augury and Mr. Tilak expect- 
ed the same reasonable attitude from both the parties in 
the Bombay Provincial Conference that was to be held 



TOWARDS REPRESSION I9I 

at Dhulia, under the Presidentship of the late Mr. Daji 
Abaji Khare. The Convention Committee appointed 
by the Moderates at Surat was to meet at Allahabad in 
the Easter Holidays ; and it was the earnest wish of 
many that the Bombay Conference should be held 
before the Easter. But to suit the convenience of the 
President, it was decided to be held after the Easter. 
At the eleventh hour, however, Mr. Khare refused to 
preside, and his place was filled by the late Hon. 
Mr. G. V. Joshi. Before, however, the Conference 
could meet, the Convention Committee held its 
sittings at Allahabad and passed certain rules and re- 
gulations which were not likely to commend themselves 
to the Nationalists. The work of Congress compro- 
mise thus became more difficult than ever, but with 
his usual optimism, Mr. Tilak refused to be discouraged. 
The Dhulia conference commenced its sittings on April 
17th. Resolutions on Swadeshi, Boycott, and National 
Education were passed. To the last two Resolutions 
there was in the Conference a slight opposition. The 
resolution appointing a Committee to bring about Con- 
gress Compromise was moved by Mr. Tilak ; speaking to 
this resolution he declared how suicidal it would be to 
leave out of the Congress any party pledged to peaceful 
and "constitutional" methods, only because that party 
preached independence. 

It is not impossible that the Congress Compromise 
on which Mr. Tilak had set his heart, would have been 
an accomplished fact long ago, had not the whole poli- 
tical atmosphere been suddenly changed for the worse 
by the unexpected appearance of the bomb. On April 
30th, a bomb intended for Mr. Kingsford, Sessions 



192 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Judge at Mozufferpore struck Mrs. and Miss Kennedy 
leaving them killed on the spot. This incident created 
a panic, intensified by the rapid arrests of a number of 
Bengali youths. The fury of the Anglo-Indian Com- 
munity knew no bounds and some fanatics like the 
Pioneer and the Asian began to cry for blood. The 
Moderates and the Loyalists were terrified and lost all 
sense of proportion. The Government was panic-stri- 
ken. The delicate duty of warning the Government of 
the dangers of repression, the Terrorists of the utter 
futility of their doings and the Moderates of the neces- 
sity of keeping their heads cool, fell upon the " Extre- 
mists " and this duty Mr. Tilak discharged with his 
usual candour. He did not " speak of murders with 
approval " nor did he " hail the advent of the bomb in 
India as if something had come to India for its good." 
He did not, like Mathew Arnold, refuse to call a man 
murderer who "for some great public cause, without 
love or hate, austerely raised his arm against a power 
exempt from common checks." On the contrary he 
considered it to be " the country's misfortune " that the 
bomb had come ; and he called upon the Government, 
with all the fervour at his command to uproot this 
' poisonous tree ' by giving larger political rights to the 
people. He clearly saw through the attempts made to 
fasten the responsibility of such events upon the much- 
disliked agitator. But really speaking " the ultimate 
cause of terrism in Bengal must be sought in the utterly 
selfish, high-handed and tyrannical policy of the Govern- 
ment and in the contemptuous and insulting manner 
in which most official and non-official Anglo-Indians 
have spoken of and treated the Bengalees. They have 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 1 95 

ridden rough-shod over the feelings of the Bengalees and 
turned a deaf ear to their strongest and most reasonable 
representations, supported by facts and figures. The 
Russianization of the administration in spirit and me- 
thods has led to the conversion of a small section of the 
people to the methods of Russian teiroism. It is sim- 
ply a question of action and re-action, ' Stimulus * and 
* response '." 

Mr. Tilak had nothing but contempt for those who 
in their hurry to save their skin and position were osten- 
tatiously profuse in their condemnation of the Terro- 
rists. His views may be summed up in the following 
words of the talented editor of the Modern Review.^ 
** It may be easy for arm-chair critics who are incapa- 
ble of risking or sacrificing anything for humanity, to 
inveigh in unmeasurable terms against persons who 
have made terrible mistakes, but who nevertheless were 
prepared to lose all that men hold dear, for their race 
and country ; — persons whose fall has been great, be- 
cause perhaps, equally great was their capacity for 
rising to the heights of being ; but for ourselves, we 
pause awe-struck in the presence of this m-ystericus 
tragedy of mingled crime and stern devotion. Deplore 
as we do the death of the two European women, and 
strongly condemn the murderous deed, we scorn to 
associate ourselves in our condolence and condemnation 
with those Anglo-Indian editors and others who have 
not even a word of regret to express, when brutal Anglo- 
Indians kill inoffensive and defenceless Indians or assault 
helpless Indian women. Whatever feelirgs we express, 
we must do independently and in measured terms."

On May 22nd, the following statement was issued over 
the signatures of Mr. Tilak and 24 leading Nationalists 
of Maharashtra : — 

" We view with deep regret the recent acts of violence 
on the part of certain young men in Bengal, resulting 
i» lamentable deaths. 

" We firmly believe that these regrettable occurances 
are the result of prolonged and persistent disregard of 
public opinion and a continued pohcy of repression 
on the part of the Government, and not as alleged in 
some quarters of any speeches or writings. 

" We are convinced, that the true remedy for the 
present state of things, lies, not in the adoption of any 
measures of repression and coercion, which must prove 
futile, but in the prompt redress of popular grievances 
and in making liberal concessions to the legitimate 
demands and aspirations of the people in a spirit of 
large-minded sympathy and far-sighted statesmanship. 

" We hold that such a pohcy of concihation will be 
in harmony with the best traditions of British Rule in 
India." 

But just as Mr. Tilak and others were convinced 
that the real cause of these fanatical outbursts lay in the 
■unsympathetic rule of a Bureaucracy, irresponsible to 
the people of this country, so was the Bureaucracy con- 
vinced that it was the agitators whose pernicious wri- 
tings and speeches had created such a tense situation. 
They, therefore, set themselves to stamp out the bomb 
by making penal the mere possession of chemicals re- 
quired for preparing bombs, by a stringent Press Act 
and a vigorous hunting of * sedition.* A Press Act was 
contemplated, but it saw the light of the day a couple

of years later. Newspaper prosecutions commenced 
right earnestly. Early in June as many as four editors 
were arrested in the Bombay Presidency, om charges of 
sedition. When the smaller fry was thus being disposed 
of, Mr. TUak could not be ignored, and when on 
June 20th, 1908, the (then) Governor of Bombay re- 
marked that certain persons possessing influence over 
the people were exciting hatred and contempt against 
the Government and that they were playing with fire 
it was clearly understood that the remarks were specifi- 
cally meant for Mr. Tilak, who, four days later, was 
arrested (June 24th, 1908.)

ff^HE arrest of Mr. Tilak, though it caused widespread 
grief and resentment did not surprise anybody. What 
however extremely surprised all was that such a mild and 
innocent article as that of May 12th, 1908 had been 
selected for prosecuting Mr. Tilak under Sections 124 A 
and 153 A of the Indian Penal Code. The Government 
of Bombay seem to have realised the risk of getting 
conviction on the article of May 12th and so, another 
sanction to prosecute Mr. Tilak for publishing the lead- 
ing article in the Kesari of June 9th entitled " These 
remedies are not lasting " was given, a fresh warrant 
was issued and executed on Mr. Tilak in jail ; and by 
two separate orders was Mr. Tilak committed to the 
Criminal Sessions of the Bombay High Court on June 
29th, 1908. 

Mr. Tilak's misfortunes did not end here. On July 
2nd, an application for bail, made on his behalf by Mr, 
Jinnah before Mr. Justice Davar was rejected and this 
was the more curious, as eleven years back, Mr. Davar 



THE country's MISFORTUNE I97 

^then a barrister, had strongly pleaded in favour of Mr. 
Tilak before the late Mr. Justice Tyabji on this very 
point. Mr. Davar the Barrister had argued that " the 
'Only ground on which this application could be opposed 
would be an apprehension that the accused might not be 
forthcoming for his trial." Mr. Davar, the Judge, 
however declared " I am not in accord with the state- 
ment, broadly made that the only consideration which 
ought to guide the Court in deciding whether bail 
should or should not be granted, was the consideration 
that the accused would appear to take his trial." 

Mr. Tilak's next misfortune was the successful appli- 
cation of the Crown to the Court for directing that 
a Special Jury should be empanelled to try him. Mr. 
Baptista, appearing for Mr. Tilak conclusively proved 
how, if a Special Jury was empanelled it would consist 
of a majority of Europeans, who, besides being ignorant 
of Marathi would not be the best Judges of articles 
** exciting disaffection against the Government." Mr. 
Tilak was moreover charged with exciting the feelings 
of Indians against Europeans. The result would be, 
said Mr. Baptista, that on the charge under 124 A, the 
rulers would sit in judgment upon a subject for his alle- 
ged rebellious spirit and under Section 153 A, the 
accusers would sit in judgment upon the accused for 
exciting hostility against themselves. A Common Jury 
would, on the other hand, cons st of a majority of 
Non-Europeans. Mr. Baptista's prayer, however, was 
not granted and a Special Jury was ordered to be 
empanelled. 

On Monday, July 13th, when the hearing of the cases 
commenced, the Advocate General proposed (Sec. 234 



198 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

C. P. Code) to put Up the accused on both the charges at' 
the same trial ; and to avoid a technical difficulty of 
law, he proposed to put the accused up on two charges- 
under Section 124 A and one charge under Section. 
153 A, staying for a time proceedings under 153 A with 
respect to the article of 12th May. This procedure was 
prejudicial to Mr. Tilak's interests but in spite of his 
protests, the joinder of charges was allowed. The result 
of this was, as the detailed reports of the proceedings 
clearly show% that practically "one single article of June 
9th was made the ground of three convictions and 
sentences on three different charges." 

The * objectionable ' passages on which the prosecu- 
tion relied were not specified. Mr. Tilak drew the 
attention of the learned Judge to this difficulty. He 
was however told that the whole lot of the words was 
objected to and with His Lordship's permission, the 
charges were amended by putting in the whole articles- 
into the charge. This was, of course very convenient 
to the Prosecution, but it increased Mr. Tilak's burden 
and compelled him to explain each and every sentence 
while conducting his defence. 

The only prosecution witness seriously cross-exami- 
ned by Mr. Tilak, who conducted his own defence, was- 
the late Mr. B. V. Joshi, First Assistant to the Oriental 
Translator, Bombay. The cross-examination is a model. 
of skill and resourcefulness. It reveals Mr. Tilak's 
command over the Marathi as also his proficiency in all. 
the arts of an Advocate. Mr. Tilak completely suc- 
ceeded in proving that the transaltions were perverted* 
Words likely to be unfavourable to him were grossly 
though unintentionally mistranslated ; while expres- 



THE country's MISFORTUNE igg 

sions, which were favourable to him were made consi- 
derably milder. 

When Mr. Tilak's house was searched, a post-card 
containing the names of two books " Hand-book on 
Modern Explosives " and " Nitro-explosives " was 
found. It was quite natural and proper for the editor 
of a newspaper to purchase books on explosives whea 
the Government was contemplating legislation on the 
subject. *' A book is not a bomb, much less the name ot 
It." The Post-card, however, received undue promi- 
nence and it was put in, as one of the Exhibits by the 
Prosecution. To explain the Post-Card, Mr. Tilak had 
to put a bundle of sundry papers, by which he lost 
his right of reply. Finding that this right, so precious- 
to an accused, especially in a trial by Jury, was thus 
taken away, Mr. Tilak put in 71 cutting from different 
papers, to show how his own articles formed part of a 
poUtical controversy. 

In his written Statement, Mr. Tilak accepted full res- 
ponsibility for the incriminating articles, gave his own 
English renderings for some of the Marathi words oc- 
curring in the articles, quoted his views on Political 
Reform from his statement before the Decentralization 
Commission and concluded by saying that the Charge- 
Articles formed part of a controversy, in which he had 
endeavoured to maintain and defend those views. He 
also successfully explained the post-card. He commen- 
ced his speech on "Wednesday, July 15th, at about 4 P.M. 
the speech occupied full 21 hours and 10 minutes, 
WTiile it was being delivered, * " The Judge, Jury an(i 

• From the Modern Review. 



200 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the Prosecuting Counsel shrank into insignificance be- 
fore the towering personahty of Mr. Tilak." It was a 
nice discourse on the law of sedition both Indian and 
English ; and though Mr. Tilak did not succeed in 
convincing the Judge and the majority of the Jurors, 
still " on his countrymen at large, the speech produced 
an elevating effect.'* After reading out Section 124 A, 
under which two charges were framed against him, Mr. 
Tilak said, " This Section is divided into two parts. 
The first part refers to actually bringing into hatred or 
contempt His Majesty etc. But as there is no evidence 
before the Court that any excitement has been caused 
by the articles in question, so it seems to me that the 
Prosecution does not mean to proceed under that part 
of the section. The second part of the Section deals 
with ' attempts to excite disaffection '. The Section 
does not simply refer to the publication of anything 
likely to create disaffection. * An attempt is an inten- 
tional premeditated action, which if it fails in its objects, 
fails through circumstances independent of the person, 
who seeks its accomplishment.' Attempt is actually 
an offence, minus the final act of crime. The mere fact 
that a certain article is published will not make it an 
attempt. There must be a criminal mind, a culpable 
indifference to consequences. In the present case, there 
has been no evidence to prove that the attempt failed 
because, the Government interfered or because the 
people refused to listen. Attempt includes both mo- 
tives and intention. To take a common illustration, I 
intend to go the Bori Bunder Station and my end in 
view is to go to Poona. In deciding intention, it is 
not safe to follow the maxim of the Civil Law * every 



THE country's MISFORTUNE 201 

man must be presumed to intend the natural conse- 
quences of his acts.' My contention is supported by 
the caseofRex z;s.Baru3,Hyndmanaai^Or3 which was 
tried by Justice Cave who in his charge to the Jury 
said : 

' I am unable to agree entirely with the Attorney- 
General when he says that the real charge is that 
though these men did not incite or contemplate disorder 
yet as it was the natural consequence of the words they 
used, they are responsible for it. In order to make out 
the offence of speaking seditious words, there must be a 
criminal intent upon the part of the accused ; there must 
be words, spoken with a seditious intent ; and although 
it is a good working rule to say that a man must be 
taken to intend the natural consequences of his acts, 
yet if it is shown from other circumstances that he did 
not actually intend them, I do not see how you can ask 
a Jury to act upon what has become a legal fic- 
tion. * * * * j]^Q maxim that a man intends the 
natural consequences of his acts is usually true, but it 
may be used as a way of saying that, because reckless 
indifference to probable consequences is morally as bad 
as an intention to produce these consequences, the two 
things ought to be called by the same name and this is 
at least an approach to legal fiction. It is one thing 
to write with a distinct intention to produce disturbance 
and another to write, violently and recklessly, matter 
likely to produce disturbances.' 

Criminal intention cannot be presumed but must be 
positively proved by the evidence of surrounding cir- 
cumstances. The motive of an act must not be con- 
■" ^ »

202 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

founded with the intention ; but is always one of the 
surest indications in an inquiry as to intention. If the- 
writer's motives are good, if he is trying to secure 
constitutional rights for the people, trying in a 
fair way and persevering manner, he is entitled 
to express his views fully and fearlessly. Intention 
may be inferred from the legal fiction that a 
man intends the natural consequences of his acts. 
But if there are circumstances to show that the- 
motive of a man is different, then the mere fact 
that the views of the writer are not correct, or are even 
absurd, or that he has expressed them in violent lan- 
guage, would not make him seditious. It is not a 
question of the correctness and acceptability of views^ 
or of the stylef in which they have been expressed. 
The incriminating articles form part of a controversy 
between the Pro-Bureaucratic party and the Pro- 
Congress party. There was a bomb outrage at Mozuf- 
ferpore. There was no difference of opinion as to the 
character of the deplorable event ; but the question was 
* what is the cause of it ?' The Pro-Bureaucratic 
Party laid the blame at the doors of the Congress or of 
the NationaHst Party and called upon Government to 
put us down. I have taken the other side. My wri- 
tings are (i) a reply to the Anglo-Indian criticism (2) 
a suggestion to Government and addressed to Govern- 
ment (3) a discussion of the situation (4) a warning to 
both parties which, it is my duty as a journalist to give 
(5) a criticism of the contemplated measures by the 
Government. I will read extracts from a few Anglo- 
Indian writings. The Pioneer of May 7th recommends- 
a whole-sale arrest of the acknowledged Terrorists in a 



THE COUNTRY S MISFORTUNE 20^ 

city or District, coupled with an intimation that on the- 
repetition of the offence, ten of them would be shot for 
every life sacrificed. It tries to establish a logical con-^ 
nection between members of the Council and Bomb- 
throwers in Bengal. The Asian recommends to Mr. 
Kingsford's notice a Mauser pistol and hopes he would 
secure a big * bag ', adding that he will be more than 
justified in letting day-light into every strange native 
approaching his house or person. A correspondent of 
the Englishman suggests that * a few of these worthy 
agitators should be flogged in public by the town-sweep- 
ers.' Now, we honestly believed that these writings- 
were mischievous, particularly the insinuations of those 
writers and they had to be counteracted. My reply 
to the Anglo-Indian Press is written on an occasiou 
of provocation. It does not intend to excite dis-affection. 
For every sentence in my writings, I can point out a 
parallel passage from the literature of our party. Pro- 
Congress Newspapers, completely hostile to the Kesariy 
take the same view of the matter. I am charged spe- 
cifically with attempting to cause excitement, not 
through-out India, but among the Marathi-speaking 
population. I do not stand alone in my views. Papers 
of aU parties in the Marathi-speaking community have 
taken the same view of the matter. This absolves me 
from any evil intention. If there is no personal preju- 
dice against me, these articles will show that I was not 
prompted by my personal prejudices. The arguments 
have not been invented by me. In charging me with 
sedition, this must be borne in mind * what impressions 
will my writings produce on the Marathi speaking 
public ?' All they say is, ' well, the reply has been- 



204 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

well given/ I have been writing nothing which I have 
not written for 28 years ; and the view expressed in my 
article has been already expressed by some leaders of 
our party. Taking all these points into consideration, 
the construction put upon the words of the articles by 
the Prosecution is unjustifiable. Moreover, in my own 
interest, and in the interest of the cause I represent I 
am bound to question the translations, which are com- 
pletely distorted. It is simply intolerable that con- 
viction for sedition should be based upon such trans- 
lations. If I succeeded in showing that the wording of 
these translations is not correct, that in itself is enough 
to ensure my acquittal. The words on which the Pro- 
secution is likely to rely are found to be distorted 
images of the original words. Marathi terminology in 
the discussion of Political subjects not being settled, I 
have been required to labour under a very great dis- 
advantage, especially as, frequently we have to write 
on the spur of the moment ; and the translator has made 
an attempt to translate the Marathi language of 1908 
with the aid of a dictionary published full fifty years 
ago, not realizing that old fortifications cannot stand 
before new guns. I gave Mr. Joshi this sentence to 
translate " A despotic Government need not necessarily 
be tyrannical," and the translator himself found it diffi- 
cult to express the two shades of meaning in Marathi. 
The charge is based not upon the original Marathi but 
upon the translations. Therefore the Prosecution 
must stand or fall by the correctness or incorrectness 
of the translations. It is likely to be urged ' take away 
the Bureaucracy and what hope is left ?' But I submit, 
the Bureaucracy is not the Government. The Bomb- 



THE country's MISFORTUNE 205- 

outrages were quickly condemned in my papers, as 
the Anglo-Indian papers. But in condemning them^ 
we say that we must also condemn the repres- 
sive measures of Government. Both parties are 
taking advantage of the presence of the bomb. The 
Bureaucratic Party are taking advantage of it to 
suppress political agitation, and the other party is 
taking advantage of it to claim some reforms. It is 
the same question which was fought out by Erskine 
in the case of the Dean of St. Asaph. I can trace a 
great struggle between the people on the one hand^ 
and a mighty Bureaucracy on the other ; and I ask 
you to help us, not me personally, but the whole of 
India. I am now on the wrong side of life and for 
me it can only be a matter of a few years, but future 
generations will look to your verdict and see whether 
you have judged right or not. If at least one of yoa 
would come forward and say that I was right, it will 
be a matter of satisfaction to me ; for I know, that if 
the Jury are not unanimous in England, another trial 
takes place. It is not so here, but it would be a 
moral support upon which I would rely with great satis- 
faction. I appeal to you, not for myself, but in the 
interest of the cause which I have the honour to re- 
present. It is the cause that is sacred and I doubt 
not, gentlemen, that He, before whom all of us will 
have to stand one day and render an account of our 
actions will inspire you with the courage of 3'our con- 
victions and help you in arriving at a right decision on 
the issue involved in this case." 

It is impossible to adequately summarize the whole 
of Mr. Tilak's masterly address within the limits at our 



206 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

disposal. His disquisitions on Section 153A, and his 
running commentary on the incriminating articles 
must be completely dropped. What has been at- 
tempted above is a bare outline of some of the princi- 
ple points which he pressed in his favour. He finish- 
ed his address at about 12-30 p.m., on the eighth and 
last date of the trial (Wednesday, 22nd July 1908). 
The reply of the Advocate-General was severely satiri- 
cal and extremely offensive. He himself seems to 
have been conscious that he had exceeded the bounds 
of decorum and in conclusion declared himself to be 
ready to stand by any rebuke, which His Lordship 
might offer to him. Some of the gems in his speech 
are worth recording : — 

" You have been told, that you are guardians of 
the Press. Fiddlesticks ! You are guardians 
of the Penal Code and the Penal Code protects 
the Press." 
" He (Mr. Tilak) has been trying his best to 
throw all the dust he could collect, even in the 
monsoon weather, into j^our eyes on this point. 
It is not what he now says he meant, but what 
he meant when he wrote them (the articles) 

that matters He cannot be allowed 

' to say now ' of course I wrote sedition and 
' ^ meant affection.' 

" Can you conceive anybody with the faintest 
knowledge of law putting forward such a sug- 
gestion seriously, that he was entitled to write 
these articles in self-defence ? This is the 
right that Mr. Tilak put forward in his defence 
yesterday. I think the accused must have 



THE country's MISFORTUNE 20/ 

laughed, when he left the Court, after having 
put forward that defence, to think that it was 
received in silence instead of Homeric laugh- 
ter." 
" I had intended to avoid the language of passion. 
But having the misfortune to sit through 
these ravings from morning to morning etc." 
Strong exception could have been taken to such 
"" ravings " and Mr. Tilak was nothing, if not extre- 
mely jealous of his rights. But he disdained to cri- 
ticise the satirical language which Mr. Branson used 
in his speech, which lasted for four hours. The 
Judge thought it desirable to finish the case that day 
- — or rather that night ; and so, perhaps the Advocate- 
General brought his remarks to a hurried close. The 
Summing-up of the Judge followed — in lamp light, — 
and it was an adverse charge to the Jury. The Jury 
retired for consideration at about 8 p.m., and returned 
at 9-20 P.M. During the dismal silence of more than 
one hour in the dim gas-light, every friendly heart 
quailed. The finger on the wall was but too clear; 
Mr. Tilak, however, was always peculiarly 
heroic in such moments and in a whisper gave expres- 
sion to his feelings in the noble words of Lord Krishna 

"If you are defeated, you rule heaven ; if you 
win, the world is at your feet." At last, the suspense 
was over. The Jurors came out and announced the 
majority verdict of guilty on all charges. They were 
divided by 7 to 2 ; the Judge agreed with their ver- 
dict and before passing any sentence, asked the accused 
whether he wished to say anything before sentence 



208 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

was passed. Here was an opportunity for Mr. Tilak 
to withdraw his remarks or express regret for hi& 
conduct and attitude. But his spirit was unbending ; 
his cause was sacred and invincible. " In a solemn 
and piercing tone " he uttered the following words 
which deserve to be written in letters of gold : — 
*' All I wish to say is that in spite of the verdict 
of the Jury, I maintain that I am innocent. 
There are higher Powers that rule the desti- 
nies of things ; and it may be the will of the 
Providence that the cause which I represent 
may prosper more by my sufferings than by 
my remaining free." 
Let us compare these words with those of the 
Judge, when he sentenced the accused to six years* 
Transportation (three years on each charge of sedition) 
to which a fine of Rs. i,ooo (on the third charge) was 
added: — "It is my painful duty to pass sentence upon 
you. I cannot tell you how painful it is to me to see you 
in this position. You are a man of undoubted talents 
and great power and influence. Those talents and 
that influence, if used for the good of your country, 
would have been instrumental in bringing about a 
great deal of happiness for those very people whose 
cause you espouse. Ten years ago you were con- 
victed and the Court dealt most leniently with you 
and the Crown dealt still more kindly with you. 
* * * It seems to me that it must be a diseased 
mind, a most perverted intellect, that could say that 
the articles, which you have written are legitimate 
weapons in political agitation. They are seething 
with sedition, they preach violence ; they speak ol 



THE country's MISFORTUNE 209 

murders with approval ; and the cowardly and atro- 
cious act of committing murders with bombs not only 
seems to meet with your approval, but you hail the 
advent of the bomb in India as if something has 
come to India for its good. As I said it can be only 
a diseased and perverted mind that can think that 
bombs are legitimate instruments in political agita- 
tions. And it must be a diseased mind that could 
ever have thought that the articles you wrote were 
articles that could have been legitimately written. 
Your hatred of the Ruling Class has not disappeared 
during these ten years. And in these articles, delibe- 
rately and defiantly written week by week, not as 
you say, on the spur of the moment, but a fortnight 
after that cruel and cowardly outrage had been com- 
mitted upon two innocent English women, you wrote 
about bombs as if they were legitimate instruments 
in political agitations. Such journalism is a curse 
to the country. I feel much sorrow in sentencing 
you. I have considered most anxiously in the case 
of a verdict being returned against you, what sen- 
tence I should pass upon you. * * * Having re- 
gard to your age and circumstances, I think it is 
most desirable, in the interest of peace and order and 
in the interest of the country which you profess to 
love, that you should be out of it for some time." 

When on the morrow, July 23rd, Mr. Tilak's 53rd 
birthday, the news of his conviction spread like wild 
fire, most impressive demonstrations were witnessed. 
The bazars were spontaneously closed ; schools and 
colleges were deserted. The Mill-hands of Bombay 
struck work for six days in honour of Mr. Tilak. 
14 



210 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Condolence meetings were held all over the country; 
Many of the Moderate leaders were ungenerous not 
to take part therein. A notable instance is that of 
Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. The Hon. Mr. Gokhale, 
(then in England), too, stood aloof from a condolence 
meeting in London. He was requested to preside on 
the occassion, but he refused to take any part in the 
meeting ; nor did he organize a meeting of his own, 
for the same purpose. This attitude of Mr. Gokhale 
created an impression that he and his associates were 
pledged to support a policy of repression. ^1,^ 

In noticing Mr. Tilak's conviction, the London 
Times said : — 

" The real importance of Mr. Tilak's conviction 
lies in the fact that he is the acknowledged and un- 
disputed leader of the Extremists' Movement in India. 
That he had a guilty knowledge of the darker deve- 
lopments of that movement is not, of course, sug- 
gested. Mr. Tilak remained, at the moment of his 
-conviction, the most conspicuous politician in India 
and among large sections of the people, he has enjoy- 
ed a popularity and wielded an influence that no 
other public matt in the Dependency could claim to 
equal. The Extremists' Movement, in its open mani- 
festitations both within and outside the Congress 
was ahnost entirely his conception." 

The Indian Press was almost unanimously of opi- 
nion that Mr. Tilak did not get justice. But the 
Full Bench of the Bombay High Court as also the 
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, thought 
that he had ; — and there we must leave the 
question. 



THE country's MISFORTUNE 211 

As soon as the sentence was pronounced and the 
Judge had left the Court, Mr. Tilak was taken charge 
©f by the PoUce and was sent to Sabarmati gaol to 
celebrate his 53rd birth-day (23rd July 1908). He 
was treated just like a common convict; and it was 
only when ten days of jail diet brought down his 
weight by 10 lbs. that apprehension was felt concerning 
his health, and a gentleman's diet was given to 
him. 

From Sabarmati, he was removed (Sept. 13th, 1908) 
to Mandalay. His sentence was commuted to one of 
simple imprisonment. This '* act of grace " acted pre- 
judicially to Mr. Tilak's interests. Had the original 
sentence been executed, he would have got greater 
remission. Besides, in the Andamans he would have 
been able to Uve in perfect freedom after furnishing 
the usual security. While, at Mandalay, he had to confine 
himself, for six long years, to a room measuring 
20x12. He represented these facts to the authorities, 
but to no purpose. 

When Mr. Tilak was sentenced to transportation for 
six years, there were few, even among his opponents 
who expected him to survive the term of his exile. 
Two things however, besides his own fortitude and 
Faith in God, enabled him to outlive the dread mo- 
notony and killing soUtude of his life. They were (i) 
health and {2) mental occupation. But these, in their 
turn depended upon things quite beyond his control. 
The Government, however, was pleased to deal with 
him leniently. He was allowed to have his own food 
cooked by a Brahmin convict specially kept at his 
disposal; and when diabetes raised its head, he could 



212 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

change it and have the special diet which he had after 
careful research, found suitable for diabetic patients. 

As regards mental occupation, though all books or 
periodicals bearing on current Politics were rigourously 
excluded, Mr. Tilak could yet command the free use of 
other books and of writing materials. " Though con- 
j&ned in a room of 20X12 he could, if he liked, go out 
hunting with the primeval Aryan warriors in the 
Rigveda; enjoy the super glory of the Aurora with the 
Pole-Star at zenith overhead; busy himself with the 
ritual mysteries of the Vedic sacrificers gathered around 
their sacred Vedis; revel in the prospective clash of 
arms, when the numberless armies of the Pandavas 
and the Kauravas met on the bloodthirsty Kurukshetra; 
hsten to the Song Celestial as it was delivered in divine 
accents by Krishna to Arjuna; or take a tour round 
the world in company with the authors of the 
Historians' History of the World." When so much 
' latitude ' was given to him, surely Mr. Tilak had no 
" right to complain ! " 

Even the longest night has an end; and Mr. Tilak 
who received neither the benefit of the Delhi Durbar 
(1911) nor that of the usual remission was at long last 
secretly brought from Mandalay and liberated in front 
of his residence at midnight on June i6th, 19 14 !

IVTR. TILAK'S transportation to Mandalay was 
followed by a long period of political re-action. 
Boycott, political or economic, ceased to count as a 
iactor in practical politics. Only lord Minto's 
" Honest Swadeshi " lived. National schools and 
colleges were deserted. The Samitts were sup- 
pressed. Arbitration courts collapsed. Whole- 
sale repression drove the movement underground, 
bringing Terrorism in its train. The Terrorist was 
vigorously hunted. Popular leaders found their way 
either to goal or to self-imposed exile. The National 
Congress with its ever-dwindling enthusiasm and 
attendance, met only to register the grosving depres- 
sion of the Moderate leaders. The " Reformed " 
Councils had disillusioned the people. Even Mr. 
Gokhale's optimism was shattered. The Octopeaa 



214 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Press Act strangled all freedom of writing. National- 
literature was mostly proscribed, especially all that 
described Mr. Tilak's personality or preached his 
principles. Evidently this was an attempt to make 
the people to forget him. *" A hush had fallen over 
the country. No man seemed to know which way 
to move and from all sides came the question * What 
shall we do next ? What is there that we can do ?* " 

On his return to Poona, Mr. Tilak could read this 
question on every face. The great Nationalist Party 
so laboriously organised by him was thoroughly 
routed. People asked themselves the question, 
** Would Mr. Tilak take his rightful place as the 
leader of the Nationalists or would he, like so many 
others, bow to the inevitable and spend the evening 
of his life in philosophy and meditation *'? The 
future of India de})ended on what answer Mr. Tilak- 
would give to this question. At a welcome meeting, 
held at Poona on Sunday 21st June 1914, he said :— 

' When after six year? absence, I return home and 
begin to renew my acquaintance with the world, I 
find myself in the position of Rip Van Winkle. 1 
was kept by the authorities in such a rigorous seclu- 
sion that it seemed that they desired that I should' 
forget the world and be forgotten by it. However I 
have not forgotten the people, and I am glad to 
notice that the people have not forgotten me. I can 
only assure the public that separation for six 
long years could not diminish my love for them and 
that I am willing and ready to serve in the satn^' 
manner and in the same relation and in the same capa- 

* Uttarapara speech of Srj. Arabindc Ghose (1909). 



RIP VAN WINKLE ! 2l5 

$ity which belonged to me six years before, though 
it may be, I shall have to modify the course a little."" 
This declaration gave a quietus to the rumour that 
Mr. Tilak " intended to devote the evening of his 
life to meditation " and scholarshp. There were 
some well-meaning advisers who even urged Mr. Tilak 
to retire from Politics and achieve " immortal re- 
nown " by writing books like the Gita Rahasya. But 
Mr. Tilak knew the mission of his life better. " Lite- 
rature and philosophy " he pointed out " are merely 
my recreation ; my life-work lies quite in a different 
direction." 

In the leaden sky of Indian politics, Mr. Tilak saw 
a few gleams of hope. The total failure of the Morley- 
Minto Reforms^ the consequent disappointment of 
the Moderate party, the awakening of the great 
Moslem community and the entry of Mrs. Besant in 
Indian Politics, inspired him with great confidence. 
His immediate political programme was threefold : 
(i) The Congress-Compromise, (2) The reorganisation 
of the Nationalist party (3) The setting on foot of a 
strong agitation for Home Rule. His leisure was 
devoted to the completion and publication (1915) of 
the Gita-Rahasya and the consideration of the steps 
to be taken against Sir Valentine Chirol for defama- 
tion. 

Seeing that he had no inclination for a life of learn- 
ed retirement, the Bureaucracy tried their hands at 
an ' ofQcial boycott ' of Mr. Tilak, and a couple of 
police-stations were created in the neighbourhood of 
his residence to keep ' a close and rigorous surveil- 
lance ' on him. Visitors to his house were * boldly 



2l6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and openly accosted ' and were required to give their 
names. If Government servants or persons in any 
way connected with the Government called upon 
him, they received warnings subsequently. It was 
a bare-faced piece of ' political Vendetta ' which had 
to be abandoned owing to the outbreak of the great 
European war in August 19 14. 

A man who had been in goal for over seven years 
of his life and who had been persecuted in a variety 
of other ways, has every reason to be embittered. 
But Mr. Tilak — who combined in himself the qualities 
of the soldier and the philosopher — took these troubles 
quite lightly, almost as a matter of course. He was 
nothing if not chivalrous and high-minded ; so when 
the British Government commenced its mortal fight 
with Germany he made (27th August 19 14) his " de- 
claration of loyalty " — a declaration which extorted 
admiration even from hostile quarters. He repudia- 
ted the nasty and totally unfounded charges against 
him, declared that he had never either directly or 
indirectly incited people to deeds of violence, denied 
that he had ever worked " with the object of sub- 
verting the British rule in India " and concluded by 
saying that " at such a crisis it is the duty of every 
Indian, be he great or small, rich or poor, to support 
and assist his Majesty's Government to the best of 
his ability." 

One effect of this declaration was to clear up many 
of the cruel misunderstandings that hung like an omi- 
nous cloud upon his personality and career. Even the 
(nominal) Advocate of India recognized in Mr. Tilak 
*' one of our loyalest and truest friends " and called 



^IF VAN WINKLE ! 21/ 

upon his detractors to " admit their mistake and make 
at the eariiest possible moment ' the amende honorable.^ " 
No wonder that Mrs. Beasant thought this to be a 
most opportune moment for bringing together the 
much-abused Moderates and the much-persecuted Ex- 
tremists. If Sir Edward Carson could suspend his op' 
position to the Liberal Ministry and shake hands with 
Mr. Asquith, could not Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Tilak 
" forget, forgive and unite " in the larger interests of 
of the country ? 

The negotiations for the Congress Compromise re- 
sulted in a temporary failure and form one of the sad- 
dest chapters in the history of Maharashtra. x\s fates 
would have it, the two great Servants of India — Tilak 
and Gokhale — were pitted against each other in a bitter 
controversy, the younger had denounced the elder 
patriot, and, before the curtain fell on the controversy, 
was himself no more (19th February 1915) ; Gokhale, 
who began life as a reverent follower of Tilak '' stabbed 
him in the dark " and then vanished into eternity ! 
Oh, the irony of human life ! 

There was a humorous side, too, to this great tragedy ! 
Gokhale, on the point of death and Sir Pherozeshah not 
far removed from it, afraid to take Mr. Tilak in the 
Congress, because, once in, he would capture it !! 
" Boycott of the Government " considered to be the 
unpardonable sin of Mr. Tilak ! ! The introduction of a 
Home Rule Bill in ParUament, through Mr. Tilak's 
influence with the Labour leaders and the concentra- 
tion of all the agitation on that one point regarded as 
the approach of deluge ! ! And all this, only six years 
before the Congress of 1920 ! ! 1 



»«l8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

In the circumstances of the case, Mr. Tilak's party 
was naturally anxious to re-enter the Congress-fold, 
not only on grounds of national unity but also for the 
more narrow reasons of party interests. The great 
Nationalist Party, organised by him in the eventful 
years of the Swadeshi agitation was, by Government 
repression weakened, silenced, disorganised, discredited 
and practically routed. As the Congress would be a 
great rallying point, Mr. Tilak's sincerity in conducting 
the negotiations was transparent. Not so, that of the 
Moderates, to whom the association with their Extre- 
mist brethren was a matter which caused uneasiness 
and occasional inconvenience. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta 
was dead against the admission of Mr. Tilak with his 
* firebrands ' into the Congress camp and others like 
Gokhale had not the courage to go against their chief. 
That is why the negotiations fell through. 

The Constitution and rules of the Congress were 
passed (1908) by a Committee appointed by the Conven- 
tion (Dec. 1907) from which many Nationalists, willing: 
to join it in spite of the evident humiliations, 
were deliberately and brusquely excluded. For the 
sake of unity, Mr. Tilak was willing to join a Congress- 
whose creed (Article No. I) was not quite inspiring, whose 
constitution was faulty and whose rules were unreason- 
able and arbitrary. But there must be some honour- 
able way of returning to the Congress. If Mr. Tilak 
wanted to go back to the Congress it must be only as 
a delegate elected by some political body recognised by 
or affiliated to the Congress. 

" The old practice of electing delegates at any public 
meeting was set aside and the election of Congress dele- 



RIP VAN WINKLE ! 21^ 

gates was completely and exclusively in the hands " of 
the Moderate Associations. ** It was unreasonable to 
expect that one party should seek admission to the 
Congress through the associations entirely controlled 
and managed by the other/' The only course, therefore, 
that could bring the Nationahsts in the National Con- 
gress was so to amend Article XX of the Congress 
Constitution as to enable them to elect their delegates 
at public meetings or meetings of Nationalist Associa- 
tions. Everything depended on the Moderate leaders* 
willingness to alter Article XX of the Congress Con- 
stitution in the desired manner. 

The rest of the story is soon told.* " Mrs. Besant 
accompanied by Mr. Subba Rao, the General Secretary 
of the Madras Congress (1914) went to Poona in the 
first week of December (1914) and conferred with Messrs. 
Tilak, Gokhale and other leading publicists of Poona. 
The suggested amendment of Article XX of the Con- 
gress Constitution was agreed upon. Then Mr. Subba 
Rao went over to Bombay to consult Sir Pherozeshah; 
he returned disappointed. Then he met Mr. Tilak, had 
a long talk with him, which frightened him as well as- 
Mr. Gokhale to whom it was subsequently reported. 
Mr. Gokhale was convinced, that Mr. Tilak's re-entry 
into the Congress Camp would only be a signal for a 
renewal of the old struggle. He, therefore, withdrew 
his support from the proposed amendment, sent an 
oral message to Mrs. Besant accordingly and in reply 
to a letter from the President-elect, wrote to him a 
confidential letter explaining the reasons of his change 
of view. That letter or its re\'ised copy 'became publia 

* From the Amrit Bazat Pairika (12th January 191 5). 



220 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

property in no time.' It was stated in this communi- 
cation that Mr. Tilak had openly avowed his intention 
of adopting the ' boycott of Government * and ob- 
structionist methods of the Irish, if he entered the 
Congress. The matter was prominently brought to 
the notice of the Subjects' Committee and naturally, 
the ears of many of its members were poisoned against 
the Mahratta patriot behind his back. In the mean- 
time, Mrs. Besant wired to Mr. Tilak to ascertain the 
truth or otherwise of the allegation, and not only did 
he give a direct lie to it, but said that many of his col- 
leagues and followers were actually serving either in 
the Legislative Council or in Municipalities and Dis- 
trict Boards ! Mr. Tilak's telegram, however, came too 
late to mend matters. An apology was, no doubt, 
offered to him and charges against him withdrawn but 
his enemies triumphed in the end by getting the ques- 
tion of reconcilation postponed and a Committee 
appointed to consider it." 

It is clear that Mr. Gokhale's conhdential* letters to 
the President-elect of the Congress spoiled the prospect 
of rapproachment between the two parties. Mr. Gokhale 
justified his conduct by asserting that his change of 
opinion with regard to the Compromise question was 
necessitated by Mr. Tilak's conversation reported to 
him by Mr. Subba Rao. It was in part as follows : — 

" In Mr. Tilak's opinion the present programme of 

* Mr. H. P. Mody, in his recently published Life of Sir Phero- 
zeshah Mehta has tried to lift the veil from this episode just a 
Mttle by giving two extracts from Mr. Gokhale's letters. Evidently 
these extracts do not exhaust the whole of Mr. Gokhale's case 
against Mr. Tilak. The venomous parts of the indictment are 
apparently still held back. 



RIP VAN WINKLE ! 22r 

the Congress was of no value. They were asking for 
small reforms while Mr. Tilak asked his countrymen to 
have nothing to do with these. He would make only 
one demand, viz, that for self-Go vernment within the 
Empire. The Irish, by resorting to methods of ob- 
struction, have in the course of 30 years, got Home 
Rule. They must also similarly adopt methods of 
obstruction within the limits of the law, and then only 
would they be able to compel the Government to con- 
cede their demands." 

All this came upon Mr. Gokhale as bolt from the blue. 
Equally startling to him was the statement of Mr. 
Tilak's conversation with Mr. Subba Rao. The state- 
ment commences thus : — 

" The attitude of the Nationalists is generally one of 
Constitutional Opposition to the Government ; while 
that of the Moderates is that of Co-operation with the 
Government. Though the ideal of both is the samej 
the difference between them lies in the methods adopted 
by them for reaching the goal." 

We leave it to the readers of to-day, to judge whether 
Mr. Gokhale's change of front could be justified by Mr. 
Tilak's remarks quoted above. It is interesting to 
note that this conversation, which so much disappoint- 
ed Mr. Gokhale occurred on December 8th 1914^ 
after Mr. Subba Rao to whom was assigned the difficult 
task of winning over the Bombay City Moderates, had 
returned quite disappointed from Bombay. Mr. Subba 
Rao has published in the New India (8th Feb. 1915) 
a statement in which he said that the Bombay Conven- 
tionist leaders were dead opposed to the amendment 
proposed by Mrs. Besant and that " great apprehension 



222 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

was felt that the Congress would be running a great risk 
if Mr. Tilak and his followers came in/' This then was 
the real cause of the failure of the compromise 
negotiations. For it was not to be expected that Mr. 
Gokhale would now continue to support the proposed 
amendment of the Constitution, though it was origin- 
ally drafted by him. 

The Report of the Committee appointed at Madras 
to consider the question of the Congress-Compromise 
was discussed at the next session of the Congress at 
Bombay and a partially satisfactory solution was arrived 
at. " Public meetings convened under the auspices 
of any association, which is not of less than two yeeirs 
standing on 31st December 19 15 and which has for one 
of its objects, the attainment of Self-Go vemment by 
India on Colonial lines within the British Empire by 
Constitutional means " were allowed and as Mr. Tilak's 
party could now send delegates to the Congress without 
looking up to the Moderates for patronage and support 
he decided to accept whole-heartedly the grudging and 
halting concession. It was high time. A new genera- 
tion of Nationalists, willing and eager to sink all differ- 
ences, had arisen. The great European War had alter- 
ed the whole outlook of the Nation. A demand for a 
substantial instalment of Self-government was to be 
formulated. It had to be backed up by the strength 
of United India. Under these circumstances Mr. Tilak 
was not the man to emphasize his differences with his 
erring and timid fellow-countrymen. As early as 
January 1916, he publicly announced the willingness of 
his party to forget the past and re-enter the Congress 
through the partially opened door. 



## THE GREAT HOME-RULER 

Sons of India ! Let your sadness  
Turn to gladness ;  
For the long night of your sorrow  
Now has passed ; a glorious morrow  
Dawns upon you. Day is shining  
Cease repining. 

C, F, Andrews, 

IN the darkest hour of Mr. Tilak's life, when neither 
friend nor foe expected him to survive six long years 
^f transportation, the Hon. Mr. Gokhale could not forget 
his old grievances against him. But Mr. Tilak was 
nothing if not chivalrous, and on hearing the unexpect- 
ed news of Mr. Gokhale's death, (19th February 19 15) 
he motored down to Poona from Sinhgad to do honour 
to the great Moderate. The funeral oration delivered 
by him on this occassion is intensely passionate. Mr; 
Tilak said : — 

" This is not a time for cheers. This is a time for 
shedding tears. This diamond of India, this jewel of 
Maharashtra, this prince of workers is laid to eternal 
rest on the funeral ground. Look at him and try to 
emulate him. * * * Every one of you should place 
his life as model to be imitated, and should try to fill 
up the gap caused by his death ; and if you will do your 
level best to emulate him in this way, he will feel glad 
even in the next world/. 



224 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

In the Provincial Conference (May 1915) in moving the 
resolution of condolence to Mr. Gokhale's family Mr. 
Tilak described how he was partially responsible- 
for introducingMr. Gokhale into the field of public life. 
This chivalry towards his political opponents has been 
markedly displayed by him on several occassions and 
it reflects great credit on Mr. Tilak, whose heart, stern 
and unbending though it was in political warfare, always 
responded to every note of affliction. In November 
1915 died Sir P. M. Mehta mourned by Mr. Tilak and the 
country at large. 

Towards the British Empire, in its hour of danger, 
he was equally chivalrous. We have already seen how, 
immediately on the outbreak of the great War (1914)^ 
Mr. Tilak publicly declared his willingness to co-operate 
with the Government. He suggested the raising of a 
citizen army. But, though even the most Moderate lea- 
ders enthusiastically favoured the idea, the Bureaucrats 
rejected the spontaneous offer of help frcm educated 
India. Of course, we were all patted on the back for 
the " fine Imperialistic instinct," but in this life-and- 
death struggle with Germany, instead of availing them- 
selves of help from whatever quarter it came, the powers 
that be confined the work of raising recruits only to 
those classes who were devoid of all patriotic conscious- 
ness. Had the attention of Mr. Asquith's Government 
been drawn to India's eagerness to fight for the Empire, 
America's help would have been superflous and conscrip- 
tion in England would nor have been necesssary. It 
was only when Mr. Lloyd George became Premier 
(December 1916) that the Cabinet called upon the 
Viceroy to make special efforts to raise recruits in India* 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22$ 

The Premier even went out of his way and suggested 
that an attempt must be made to catch the imagination 
of Indians and to stimulate their enthusiasm. But 
Lord Chelmsford himself lacked that precious quality 
of imagination and his associates wanted rather to 
damp than rouse the enthusiasm of the people. Had 
a Round-table Conference of India's trusted leaders 
been convened and the necessity of supplying strong 
contingents been explained to them, a few lakhs of 
young Indians would have at once joined the colours. It is, 
indeed, pitiable to find that the officials did not display 
even a fraction of that enthusiasm in raising citizen sol- 
diers which they did in collecting the war-loan. A Defence 
India Force of 6,000 was advertised for ; 6,000 in thirty 
crores of people ! ! The necessary Bill was passed. No 
assurance was given with regard to Home Rule, no assur- 
ance with regard to commissioned ranks to the Volun- 
teers ! Still the enthusiasm of the people knew 
no bounds. Mr. Tilak led the agitation at Poona and 
Bombay by powerful speeches, calling upon the youth, 
as they valued their country's freedom to suspend 
studies for a year or two and vindicate the fair name 
of their country. " If age and grey hair are no disqualifica- 
tions, I am prepared to stand in the fighting line." said he I 
But it was to no purpose. Eight hundred men at 
Bombay volunteered themselves on the spot. It seemed 
as if the Bureaucrats did not want the help. They 
signalized their appeal for the " Defence of India Force " 
by a resort to the notorious " Defence of India Act."! ! A 
few hours before Mr. Tilak's powerful appeal to the 
young men, he was served with an order from the 
Punjab Government prohibiting him from entering the 
15 



226 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Punjab ! Surely, this was " Co-operation " with a 
vengeance ! The satrap of the Punjab led the way ! 
The Delhi Commissioner followed suit ; and wonder of 
wonders , Mr. Tilak had not even dreamt of going 
over to the Punjab or to Delhi. When the Premier 
wanted an appeal which would fire the imagination of 
the Indians, here was an appeal of a very different 
sort. But this was only the beginning. The Press 
Deputation that waited on the Viceroy returned cruelly 
disappointed. The Press Act must still disfigure the 
Statute Book. Instead of promising substantial con- 
cessions to the people, the Government deprecated 
in strong langauge political agitation. Coercion was 
threatened. The threat was soon carried out and Mrs. 
Besant, the tall Poplar of Indian Politics was intern- 
ed. These were some of the measures intended to 
persuade the Indians to become soldiers of the Empire ! 
It is no wonder that the movement of a citizen army, 
thus ushered into existence soon collapsed. 

But Mr. Tilak did not like that matters should rest 
here. He wanted to carry the case right up to the 
British Democracy and explain to it the state of things 
in India. He knew that if he could only convince the 
British pubUc that the military resources of India were 
abundant and could well be availed of for the speedy 
termination of the War, not only would India get the 
military training denied to her these hundred years and 
more, but the solution of the Politicial problem also 
would be prompt and liberal. He tried his best to 
finduce the Congress to send a Deputation to England^ 
When, at last that hope was gone, he led the Home 
Rule League Deputation. As fates would have it, the 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22/ 

War Cabinet refused to allow the Deputation to sail at 
the last moment. In vain did Mr. Tilak appeal. Evi- 
'dently the reactionary element in the Cabinet was 
powerful and Mr. Tilak had to rest content with a cable 
to the Premier suggesting that India could supply five 
to ten millions of men, if our youths were made to feel 
that they were not fighting to establish a principle 
abroad which was not applied to them in own mother- 
land. 

At the Delhi War Conference (April 1918) Mr. Tilak 
was not even invited ; at the Bombay War Conference 
(June 1918), though invited and asked to speak he was 
not allowed to continue, but had to stop after speaking 
only for a couple of minutes. Mr. Tilak wanted to 
show how recruiting could be made popular ; but 
as the Government had their own ideas in the 
matter, the Home Rulers were invited to the 
Conference only to hear an ill-advised homily deli- 
vered to them by His Excellency the Governor (Lord 
WiUingdon). 

It will be thus seen that Mr. Tilak strenuously at- 
tempted to help the Government in their hour of need 
and trial; but his well-meant efforts met only with fail- 
ure and even rebuffs. But the irony of it all was that 
though Mr. Tilak had made attempts, which the blun- 
dering Bureaucracy frustrated, to encourager recruiting 
he was (August 1918) served with an order prohibiting 
him from lecturing without the previous permission 
of the District Magistrate ; and what was the reason ? 
Mr. Tilak, presiding at the annual Shivaji Festival 
{22nd June 1918) spoke in a way " calculated to dis- 
courage recruiting." Only a week before, Mr. Tilak had. 



228 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

publicly undertaken to enlist 5,000 recruits within six 
months on receiving an assurance that the highest 
military career without distinction of caste, creed or 
colour would be thrown open to the recruits ; and as 
guarantee of good faith, he had sent to Mahatma Gandhi 
a Deposit Receipt for Rs. 50,000 the amount to be forfeited 
as penalty if certain conditions were not fulfilled. Com- 
ment is superflous on these two pictures — Mr. Tilak 
pledging his word and money in support of recruiting 
and the Government of Bombay accusing him of " dis- 
couraging recruiting." 

Though Mr. Tilak was prepared to help the Govern- 
ment in every way to wage the war with success, he 
was not wilhng to shelve the all-important question of 
Home Rule. To those of the Bureaucrats who wanted 
Indians not to press contentious questions upon their 
attention, Mr, Tilak explained that Liberty is and ought 
to be always a non-contentious topic. It was absolu- 
tely impossible, he said, for India to watch with folded 
arms the stupendous conflict in Europe between Auto- 
cracy and Democracy. A vast intellectual revolution had 
been brought about in India as a result of the World-war, 
The moral, intellectual and political outlook of even the 
most ignorant villagers had widened. Even they had 
begun to take interest in the politics of their own country 
and that of the world at large. The declarations of respon- 
sible ministers, interpreting this world-war as a war of 
Liberty had considerably helped the national awaken- 
ing ; and under these circumstances, it was impossible 
for Indians to keep quiet. Lord Willingdon had led the 
way by asking Mr. Gokhale to make a statement of 
post-war reforms. It was, therefore, in the interests 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 229 

-of India and England alike, that this long-delayed set- 
tlement should be made. 

During 1915 and 1916, Mr. Tilak worked assiduously 
to organize his party. A strong party needs (i) a magnetic 
leadership (2) a rallying point, and, (3) a war-cry. In 
the personality of Mr. Tilak that first essential was found. 
The National Congress would have been an ideal rally- 
ing point. But it was still in its inglorious and suicidal 
isolation. The attempted compromise had failed (1914). 
Mr. Tilak, therefore, decided to hold a Session of the Pro- 
vincial Conference, the machinery of which was still ia 
the hands of the Nationalist Party. Under the able presi- 
dentship of Mr. Joseph Baptista, the Nationalists, more 
than 1,000 in number met at Poona ; and this excep- 
tionally large number of delegates, together with the 
enthusiasm which marked the proceedings conclusively 
proved that the party was still powerful and had a 
bright future before it. This conhdence was increased 
by the Moderate Conference, which was held a couple 
of months later and which, totally lacking in good at- 
tendence and enthusiasm, could seek consolation only 
in the fact that Lord Willingdon had kindly paid it a 
visit. The Belgaum Provincial Conference (1916), as 
successful as the Poona one, strengthened the Nation- 
alist in the belief that the future was in their hands. 
The success of the Poona and Belgaum Conferences 
nerved the Nationalists to join the Congress even 
though the concessions to their sentiments and self- 
respect were tardy and halting. 

It was this Poona Conference which gave the Nation- 
alists, the necessary war-cry — Home Rule. When the 
Moderates were busy only with the preparations of 



^30 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

schemes of political reform, Mr. Tilak gave his country* 
men something more inspiring. Ever since his returm- 
from prison he had fixed his heart on a tremendous 
agitation in favour of Home Rule ; knowing that the 
Bureaucracy would question the legality of the move- 
ment with the object of resorting to repression, he in- 
tended to introduce a Bill in Parliament through the 
good cfiices of Labour leaders and then concentrate all 
his activities on a vast propaganda. The sudden ad- 
vent of the war came to his rescue. The Bureaucracy 
with their armoury full of repressive legislation had to 
keep quiet and bide their time. With the Indian army 
sent away to France, repression was out of the question; 
and so the Nationalists got the necessary respite to- 
mobilize their forces and they were not slow to take full 
advantage of this opportunity. 

During these days Mr. Tilak's dealings with the two 
other parties were unexceptionable. Conscious of the grow- 
ing virilitj^ of the Naticnalists, he could afford, especially 
in the larger interests of the country to be generous m> 
bis dealings with the Moderates. Mrs. Besant too, in 
spite of occasicnal lapses was on the path of ccmplete 
alliance wilh him. the felt that she was regarded as 
an interloper by the leading Modeiales and was feared 
and distiusted by them. Mr. Tilak's vision was so 
much f cssessed with the future and its immense possi- 
bilities that he was in no meed to keep open the old 
sores. He tried to placate the Moderates and did his 
best to induce them to co-operate with him. The reso- 
lutions of the Pcona and Belgaum Conferences were 
drawn up with a 'skill that silenced the ultra-Modera- 
tes ; and lor the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak defered his. 



THE GREAT HOME-RULERj 231 

full programme of activities in connection with Home- 
Rule. 

A notable instance of Mr. Tilak's desire for unity can 
be seen in his hearty acceptance of the " Reform Memo- 
randum " of the nineteen elected members of the 
Imperial Legislative Council (October 1916). Left to 
himself, Mr. Tilak would have made more radical 
demands and we know some of his Bengal followers did 
actually make them. But Mr. Tilak wanted complete 
unanimity ; and so he was willing to take his stand on 
the memorandum with its subsequent development, vix 

— The Congress-League-Scheme. 

The inauguration of the Indian Home Rule League 
(23rd April 1916) was also a step in the same direction. 
Mr. Tilak clearly reahsed that the Congress with the 
small survivors of the Old Guard would not go in for the 
radical propaganda he wished to concentrate upon. 
If the co-operation of the leading Moderates was de- 
sired, the pace of our activities must be slowed down j 
and this he was unwilling to do. He therefore started 
the Indian Home Rule League where he and his enthu- 
siastic followers would have a free hand. As a conces- 
sion to the misgivings of the timid Moderates the Home 
Rule League accepted the creed of the National Congress, 
a thing which gratified the(Right) Hon. Mr. Shrinivasa 
Shastri. But the Government was not so gratified. 
They wanted to crush the Heme Rule Propaganda by 
striking at the towering personality to whose organising 
genius the League owed its birth. 

This year (1916), the sixty-first anniversary of Mr. 
Tilak's birth was celebrated in Maharashtra. It was 
certainly a proud and glorious day. The harassments 



232 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and persecutions that had fallen to Mr. Tilak's share 
were simply innumerable. Only he could have emerged 
unscathed out of such a terrific ordeal. More, he turned 
seeming defeats to account and successfully enhanced 
his prestige and honour from out of every reverse. 
Since 1890, he had been steadily gaining in power and 
popularity, while latterly the tide of his influence had 
become irresitible. No wonder, that, not only those 
who were associated with him in politics but many 
others took part in the celebration. A large meeting 
attended by over 8,000 persons was held (23rd July). 
Friends and admirers from different parts of Maharashtra 
read addresses and delivered congratulatory speeches. 
A dress of honour, several individual presents and a huge 
sum of one lakh of Rupees — testified to the feelings of 
his admirers. Sitting heavily garlanded in the midst 
of jubilant friends and well-wishers, Mr. Tilak thought 
of the past ; " Memories of storm and suffering " said 
he " rather than those of comparative happiness rise 
before my mind's eye." He was also saddened to find 
that those with whom he started his career in the early 
eightees — Chiplunkar, Dharap, Apte, Kelkar, Agarkar, 
Namjoshi, Gokhale — had " shuffled off their coil " one 
after the other. He alone remained to represent them. 
" Looking into the future " said he " after completing 
sixty years, one's mind cannot but be filled with mis- 
givings ; and with declining strength one is apt to feel 
less hopeful. But I devoutly hope that with your 
support, I may be granted life and strength to add to 
whatever work of public good I may have done." 

When, under somewhat similar circumstances, Par- 
Bell was presented with an enormously big cheque, he 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23J 

<quietly pocketed it and did not so much as thank his 
iriends for their generosity. He took the present as a 
matter of course. Mr. Tilak was made of a far finer 
stuff. With simple modesty and characteristic gener- 
osity, he said : — 

" I do not know what I can do with the money. I 
do not want it for my own sake nor would it be proper 
for me to accept it for personal use. I can only accept 
it in trust to spend it in a constitutional way for National 
work after adding my own quota to it." 

If the people brought their birth-day present to Mr. 
Tilak, the Government, too, contributed their mite. 
They, too, sent a birth-day present to Mr. Tilak in the 
form of a notice calling upon him to show cause why he 
should not be bound over for good behaviour for a 
period of one year in a sum of Rupees 20,000 in his own 
recognizance and in two securities of Rs. 10,000 each. 
This is a striking illustration of how " Mr. Tilak's public 
life has been like a double-faced Janus — one face of it 
expressing the enjoyment and the delight of public ap- 
preciation and the other, inseparable from the first, 
expressing the toil of determined resistance to official 
persecution." 

The Government wanted to silence Mr. Tilak, not to 
imprison him ; perhaps, the war came in the way. 
They, therefore, picked up three of his speeches — the 
^one delivered (ist May 1916) at Balgaum and the 
other two at Ahmadnagar (31st May and ist June 
1916). These speeches were models of sobriety and 
moderation. " Almost every alternate sentence pro- 
claimed the speaker's loyalty to the British connec- 
tion." Failing to find stronger exhibitions of Mr. 



^34 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Tilak's disloyalty, the Government fixed on these Home 
Rule speeches to launch their offensive against him. 
Through their counsel, they took care to inform the 
court and the world at large, that they took exception 
to Mr. Tilak's lectures on Home Rule and not to Home 
Rule itself. Mr. Binning in opening the case on 7th 
May 1916 before the District Magistrate, Poona, did 
not hesitate to call Mr. Tilak's declarations of loyalty as 
a mere cloak to defend himself from the clutches of 
law. He (Mr. Binning) questioned Mr. Tilak's bona 
fdes, laid stress on isolated passages and pressed for 
conviction. Mr. G. W. Hatch, District Magistrate 
placed rehance on Mr. Justice Strachey's interpretation 
(misinterpretation, we must now say) of the word dis- 
affection which was regarded as meaning " absence of 

ajffection." " Looking at these speeches, as a whole, 
fairly, freely and without giving undue weight to isola- 
ted passages " the only impression produced on the- 
mind of the Magistrate was that " Mr. Tilak wanted 
to disaffect his audience towards the Government " and 
knowing that he could not interest his audience in his 
arguments unless he illustrated them forcibly told them 
" that they were slaves, that their grievances remained 
undressed and that the Government only considers its 
interests, which are ahen to those of the Indians, and 
intends to keep the people in slavery under the 
excuse that Indians are not fit to rule themselves.'' 
The Magistrate, therefore, under Section 108 of C. P. 
Code, directed Mr. Tilak to enter into a bond in a sum of 
Rs. 20,000, with two sureties each in the sum of Rs. io,ooa 
to be of good behaviour for a period of one year. 
The decision was, however, reversed (9th November 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23$ 

1916) as it deserved to be, by Mr. Justice Batchelor 
and Justice (Sir) Lallubhai Shah in their separate but 
concurring judgments. (The Hon.) Mr. Jinnah ably 
defended Mr. Tilak both in the lower and the revisional 
court. But though Mr. Tilak triumphed, still his 
main points were not satisfactorily solved. The main 
feature of his speeches as the Times of India then re- 
marked was a distinction between the King and the 
King's Government. This sage paper shrewdly re- 
marked that if Mr. Tilak wanted, by this subtle distinc- 
tion to evade a law, with the meaning of which he ought 
to have been familiar, then "he is far less astute than. 
we thought him to be." This is not however a question 
of the evasion of the law or of that astuteness of the 
offender. Nor can it be set at rest by the opinions of 
the two learned Judges, Mri Justice Batchelor and Mr. 
Justice Shah. Mr, Tilak openly and sincerely professes 
his loyalty to His Majesty the King Emperor and the 
British Parliament which really are " the Government 
by law established in India." He claims full freedom 
to criticize the administration of the country. But 
Mr. Justice Batchelor holds that Government could act 
only through hum.an agency ; and as the Civil Service is 
admittedly the principal agency, where it is criticised 
en blcc, in an intemperate language, hatred of the Civil 
Service and consequently hatred or contempt of the 
Government is likely to be the result. According to 
this decision, it is purely a question of fact dependent on 
the language used and not on the distinction on which 
Mr. Tilak and his counsel relied. Regarding Mr. Tilak's 
speeches, Mr. Justice Batchelor writes as follows : — 
*' Probably the fairest way to ascertain the effect i& 



■236 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to read the three speeches from beginning to end, 
quietly and attentively, remembering the arguments 
and remembering the poHtically ignorant audience to 
whom Mr. Tilak was addressing. I have so read these 
speeches, not once, but several times, and the impres- 
sion left on the mind is that, on the whole, despite cer- 
tain passages which are rightly objected to by the 
prosecution, the general effect would not probably and 
naturally be to cause disaffection, that is hostility or 

enmity or contempt " 

Mr. Tilak's triumph was the triumph of the Home 
Kule cause. His enemies were crest-fallen. The Times 
of India, which immediately after the decision of the 
District Magistrate, had preached a homily to Mr. Tilak 
and poured out its venom in the " Politics in the 
Deccan " was compelled, knowing discretion to be the 
better part of valour, to unreservedly withdraw the re- 
marks. An attempt was made within a fortnight of 
the decision of the High Court to lure and terapt Mr. 
Tilak to disobey the District Police Act. At Gadag, 
•where Mr. Tilak had gone on private business, the Dis- 
trict Magistrate, finding that the people had assembled 
to do hirq honour, served upon him an order prohibiting 
him from delivering any harangue. This order was served 
not at the eleventh hour, but at he twelfth 
and a less astute or farsighted man than Mr. Tilak 
would have felt tempted to test its legality by 
breaking it. Mr. Tilak, however, refused to allow 
the District Magistrate to regain the ground 
which the Government had lost by their deba- 
cle in the Security Case. Ultimately, pansupari 
^as given to Mr. Tilak at the meeting and the 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 237 

proceedings ended without any hitch after Mr. Tilak had 
made a short speech. 

In October 19 16, Mr. Tilak attended the Ahmedabad 
Provincial Conference under the presidency of Mr. 
Jinnah. He received a grand reception from Gujarat 
He exhorted the Conference to support the constitu- 
tional reforms suggested in the " memorandum of 19 " 
In November he was elected a member of the All -India 
Congress Committee. 

It is pleasant to recall these days when he worked 
band-in-hand with Mrs. Besant. The Home Rule Pro- 
poganda was in full swing. The Bureaucrats were 
non-plussed, the Moderates were shaking their heads 
with doubt and hesitation. The nation was drunk with 
enthusiasm. In Europe, Autocracy was being shattered 
to pieces. India's loyalty was clear as the sun. The 
British Nation was grateful ; the reactionary element 
was weak and helpless. The sky was resounding with 
the cry of Reforms and though many an advanced 
Moderate and vaHant Nationalist did signal service to 
the National Cause during this period, posterity will 
justly give credit to the two mighty Lieutenants of the 
Goddess of Liberty for having kept the flag flying — 
Mr Tilak and Mrs. Besant, 



## RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 

For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be 
to the man or groups of men that seek to stand in our way in 
^his day of our high resolution^ when every principle we hold 
dearest is to be Vindicated and made secure for our salvation. 

President Wilson 

A FTER nine long years of separation, Mr. Tilak 
"^^ joined his old comrades at the Congress of Luck- 
now (1916). What a change ! In 1907, the nation was 
on the eve of a relentless campaign of repression. Now 
in 19 16, the country was throbbing with the expect- 
ation of a vast political transformation, which Mr. Tilak 
had worked so laboriously to bring about. No wonder 
therefore, that when he stood to address the 2350 ex- 
pectant delegates and thrice as many spectators he was 
accorded an enthusiastic ovation. He said : — 

" I am not foolish enough to think that this reception 
is given to my humble self. It is given, if I rightly 
understand to those principles for which I have been 
fighting, principles which have been embodied in the 
resolution I have the honour to support. I am glad to say 
that I have lived these ten years to see that we are going 
to put our voices and shoulders together to push on the 
scheme of Self-Government. We are now united in 
45 very way in the United Provinces." 

Without depreciating the efforts of several leaders who 



"RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT" 239 

worked hard to accomplish the Hindu-Moslem Unity, 
it may be said that Mr. Tilak's foresight and generosity 
in substantially conceding many of the demands of the 
Mahomedans gratified them beyond all measure. They 
had been taught to believe that Mr. Tilak was anti- 
Mahomedan, that in the Hindu-Moselm controversies 
of 1893-94 he had been unfriendly to them and that his 
Shivaji and Ganapati festivals were instituted with 
the sole object of irritating their community. They 
were, therefore, doubly glad to find that Mr. Tilak was 
in favour of an enormously big percentage of repre- 
sentation to the Mahomedans in the Legislative Coun- 
cils. To those of his more theoretical and hence less 
compromising brethren who looked with alarm at 
these concessions, Mr. Tilak said : — 

*' It has been said that we, Hindus have yielded too 
much to our Mahomedan brethren. I am sure, I re- 
present the sense of the Hindu community all over 
India, when I say that we could not have yielded too 
much. I would not care if the rights of Salf-Govern- 
ment are granted to the Mahomedan Community only. 
I would not care if they are granted to the Rajputs. 
I would not care if they are granted to the lower 
classes of the Hindu population. Then the fight will 
not be triangular as, at present, it is." 

This is the language, not only of magnanimity but of 
statesmanship also. By making this concession, Mr^ 
Tilak successfully accomplished his object entertained 
ever since his return from Mandalay of winning over 
the Muslims. Influences were at work to keep the 
Mahomedans away from the Hindus ; for Sir James 
Meston had publicly advised them to place communal 



240 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

considerations over the National. It was at this criti- 
cal time that Mr. Tilak threw the whole weight of his 
advice and influence over to the side of the Muslims^ 
and secured their lasting co-operation. 

In criticising (October 1916), the " Memorandum of 
19 " Mr. Tilak had said that the demand made therein 
was pretty well so far as it went but that it was neces- 
sary that the succeeding instalments of Self-government 
should be definitely determined and announced toge- 
ther with the time-limit for complete realization of all 
our aspirations. He tried his best to press the inclu- 
sion of this limit in the resolution of Self-Government. 
The Hon'ble Mr. Shastri also was of opinion that we 
should not " hesitate to demand that Responsible 
Government should be worked up to in the course of 
the next thirty years." But the stalwarts of the Con- 
gress did not favcur this view and for the sake of unity 
Mr. Tilak, dropped the matter. The Congress of 19 17 
made good this mistake and included a definite time- 
limit in the resolution of Swaraj. 

For the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak allowed his scheme 
of a small and compact Congress Executive to be shel- 
ved. The All-India Congress Committee, the tim.e- 
honoured Executive of the Congress was found to be 
quite unwieldy and the new body proposed by Mr. 
Tilak was merely a supplem.entary body and never 
aimed at usurping the functions of the old one. Doubt- 
less, Mr. Tilak took his cue from the War-Cabinet of 
three or four members which Mr. Lloyd George institu- 
ted in order to save the inevitable delays of the Cabinet 
When we remember that even Mr. Lloyd Goerge in 
times of extreme emergency and national peril could 



"RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT" 24I 

bring about this change only by creating a split in the 
Cabinet and driving out of office his old chief, we are 
not surprised that Mr. Tilak was unsuccessful. Pre- 
judices and prepossessions die hard. Mr. Tilak would 
however brook no compromise on one point. He 
wanted the Congress to call on the Home Rule Leagues 
and other pubUc Associations to carry on continuously 
a vigorous propaganda. " If the Congress " he said 
" would not lead a national agitation, let the Home 
Rule Leagues at least do the work." It was with evi- 
dent ill-grace that the veteran Moderates allowed the 
Resolution to be passed. Even Mr. Jinnah and Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya voted against it. This reso- 
lution was only the thin end of the wedge and Mr. Tilak 
trusted time to make the National Congress lead the 
National movements. 

The memorable 1917 dawned and found Mr. Tilak 
busy with his Home Rule Propaganda. During the 
whole of this eventful year, Mr. Tilak toured from one 
end of the country to the other. He deUvered lectures 
at Calcutta, Delhi, Mathura, Nagpur, Akola, Godhra, 
Surat, Jalgaon, DhuUa, Belgaum, Thana, Sholapur, 
Satara and other places too numerous to be mentioned 
in detail. It is estimated that he delivered over 100 
lectures to audiences varying from 4 to 20 thousand. 
He exhorted his countrjnnen to be up and doing ; he 
wanted them to strike while the iron was hot. His 
cherished plan of sending a Home Rule Deputation to 
England was approved of everj^-where and people 
gladly paid large sums of money to meet the expendi- 
ture. 

During the earlier course of the war, the Bureaucracy 
16 



242 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

had to hold the dog of repression in leash. But when 
the Home Rule Leagues were started, the officials felt 
that something must be done to arrest the tide of enthu- 
siasm. With this object in view, they tried to overawe 
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Tilak. But the proceedings against 
both failed to accomplish the purpose. Then came the 
Lucknow Congress ; and the unique combination of zeal 
and wisdom, of dash and caution, of idealism and 
practical statesmanship which the session revealed con- 
vinced the Government officials that a New India 
was really born. The Bureaucracy set itself a- 
thinking. Even as early as March 19 16, Lord 
Hardinge had cautioned India not to hold any extra- 
vagant hopes and to remember that even in the now 
Self-Governing Colonies, the step of progress had been 
slow. Lord Chelmsford too had raised his voice against 
what he called catastrophic changes. About March 
19 17 " the Government of India issued a Circular to 
Local Governments outlining the poUcy to be pursued 
by the latter in connection with the Indian demand 
for reforms.*' Circulars, prohibiting students from 
attending political meetings, especially those convened 
by the Home-Rulers or where Home Rule was likely to 
be discussed were issued. In May 1917, the Governor 
of Madras and the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab made 
" pronouncements which betrayed by their similarity 
of tenor and phraseology, a common source of inspira- 
tion. In these pronouncements, .these heads of two 
provinces exaggerated the nature of Indian demands, 
deprecated them in strong language, enjoined the 
people to abstain from all agitation and threatened 
them with repressive action if they did not do so,*' 



•' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT *' 243 

Next to Maharashtra, Madras was the most active pro- 
vince in the cause of Home Rule; unfortunately its Satrap 
-was extremely anxious to loom in the lime-light. He 
therefore carried out his threat of repression by issuing 
Internment orders against Mrs. Besant and two of her 
colleagues. He had expected that the internment of 
Mrs. Besant would cow down the people. He must have 
been surprised to find his tyranny met with defiance. 
The whole country with one voice condemned his action. 
It was feared that this was only the first of a series of 
repressive measures contemplated by the Government. 
There was a widespread alarm that the internment of 
Besant was meant as a blow to her Home Rule League 
and that the Government would crush the Home- 
Rule Leaguers first and the Congressmen afterwards. 
Viewing the situation from this standpoint, even 
the Moderate leaders thought it their duty to join 
the Home Rule Leagues. (The Hon'ble) Mr.M. A. 
Jinnah and several other leading Congressmen and 
Muslim-leaguers in Bombay joined the Home Rule 
League immediately after the pubUcation of the 
internment order.More important still was the attitude 
of the Moderate leaders at Allahabad, who at this 
most momentous crisis joined hands with the Home 
Rulers and championed their cause. When we 
remember how, so far as the Punjab at least 
was concerned, the deportation (1907) of Lala Lajpat 
Rai had ademorahzing effect on the people, we 
can appreciate the awakening that had now come over 
the people, in that they refused to take this gratui 
tous act of repression with anything like fear or 
submission. 



244 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

At the meeting (July 28th and 29th) of the All- India 
Congress Committee, Mr. Tilak's voice reigned supreme. 
He expressed his gratification at the united and strong 
protest made by the people against the internment of 
Mrs. Besant. He heartily thanked those of the Moder- 
ates who, at the call of duty, stood by Mrs. Besant and 
the infant Home Rule Leagues. But he was not content 
merely with the protest, howsoever strong and united it 
might be. He called for action. What are we to do ? 
Our first duty was, he said, to efiect the earliest possible 
release of Mrs. Besant and her two associates. If the 
Bureaucracy took the hint and did the needful, — well 
and good. If however the fetish of prestige held the 
powers that be from recognizing their mistake, we must 
compel them to come to terms. Passive Resistance (or 
Civil Disobedience) was he said the only weapon which 
would rouse the slumbering conscience of the authori- 
ties. The Bureaucracy was on the war-path.It would not 
even allow us peacefully to protest against the intern- 
ment orders. If a meeting convened by a leader Hke 
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose was prohibited, what guarantee 
was there, that liberty of expression and action would 
be allowed to us? Mr. Tilak, therefore, called upon the 
All-India Congress Committee to give a definite lead to 
the people. 

The Moderates were in a sore fix. There was not a 
single bright speck in the political firmament on which 
they could rely. On occasions when the spirit of en- 
thusiasm is abroad, * wisdom ' is at a discount. * Fore- 
sight and reasoned judgment ' are synonyms for timi- 
dity. The Nation thinks not with the bram but with 
aa overheated heart. Who can say whether in the 



?' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 245 

long run such discarding of all caution and moderation 
leads to success or not ? It is only in the throes of 
tumult that Nations are born. It is exactly at this time 
that the moderate leaders, terrified at the narrow line 
which separates them and the people from utter destruc- 
tion cry halt. Their gray hair, their long and faithful 
services to the country fail to evoke anytking like rever- 
ential obedience. But what can the people do ? Is 
not the maxim " nothing venture, nothing have " tme 
in pohtics also ? Does it not perhaps become the only 
honourable and probably successful course on such occa- 
sions ? Unfortunately these are questions for the 
iuture historian and not for the soldiers in fight. 

In the manly representation made mainly under the 
inspiration of Mr. Tilak by the All-India Congress Com- 
mittee to the Viceroy and the Secretary of State, the re- 
presesive and reactionary policy of the Government 
of the day was condemned and the urgent necessity of 
■the immediate grant of a substantial instalment of 
Swaraj was established. It was plainly stated that 
unless a Roysd Proclamation regarding the early fulfil- 
ment of all our aspirations was issued and Mrs. Besant 
and the Ali brothers were forthwith set free the prevailing 
discontent would not be allayed. The Congress Com- 
mittee also testified to the unexceptionable and satis- 
factory work done by the Home Rule Leagues. It wiM 
thus be seen that the representation of the Committee 
was a statesmanlike document which profoundly in- 
fluenced the course of future events. 

Though Mr. Tilak was anxious to get the All-India 
Congress Committee pass a resolution recommending 
the adoption of Passive Resistance, still he was more 



246 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

anxious to carry with him as many Moderates as he pos- 
sibly could. Instead, therefore, of insisting upon an 
immediate passing of a resolution to the effect, he wil- 
lingly supported the idea that all the Provincial Com- 
mittees should in the first instance be called upon to 
submit their views on the subject. He knew that time 
was with him and that sooner or later Passive Resistance 
was bound to be adopted. He could afford to wait, 
being convinced of the ultimate result. 

Mr. Tilak disagreed with all those who sought to bring 
about the release of Mrs. Bealsant merely by prayers 
and petitions. " If we want to prove how keenly we 
feel for her," " let us elect her President of the coming 
Congress." Released or unreleased, Mrs. Besant must 
be President. This was both sentiment and statesman- 
ship. In accordance with this suggestion, the various Pro- 
vincial Congress Committees nominated Mrs. Besant for 
the Presidentship of the Calcutta Congress. This atti- 
tude was in direct opposition to the conduct and policy 
of the Moderates. Their policy was not to provoke the 
displeasure or anger of the Bureaucracy by calling upon 
persons disliked by Government to preside over the de- 
liberations of the Congress. With that object in view, 
was Mr. Tilak 's name repeatedly set aside, and when at 
Calcutta, his election seemed fairly certain, the Grand 
Old Man of India was invited (1906) for the honour. 
With that object in view, was Lala Lajpat Raikept from 
the Presidential chair, when the Nation with one voice 
demanded his election at Surat (1907). The Hon'ble 
Mr. Gokhale while opposing the election of the Lala had 
said " we cannot flout the Government. The Govern- 
ment will throttle our movement in no time. "..What 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 247 

would have been Mr. Gokhale's surprise, had he been 
living in 19 17, to learn that the overwhelming majority 
of the Nation had determined to flout the Government 
by electing Mr. Besant and Mr. Mahomed Ali for the 
Presidentship of the National Congress and Muslim 
League respectively even when they were in intern- 
ment ? 

With the Moderates' opposition to the adoption of Pas- 
sive Resistance and to' the election of Mrs. Besant for the 
Presidentship of the Congress, it was clear that a crisis 
was approaching and that the unity, which the Nation 
had shown in formulating the Congress-League scheme 
and in conducting vigorously the Home Rule agitation, 
was terribly strained. The loose organisation of the 
Congress threatened to be wrecked on the rocks of 
serious party differences. But the timely appointment 
of Mr, Montagu as Secretary of State for India consider- 
ably improved the situation. The historic declaration 
of August 20 th soon followed. Another announcement 
still — Mr. Montagu was to come over to India to study 
the question of Constitutional Reforms ! The situ- 
ation at once changed. The cry of Passive Resistance 
was dropped ; and every set of politicians began to for- 
mulate the pohtical reforms to be sought at the hands 
of the new Secretary of State. 

If there was any politician in India whose pro- 
gramme of work was not materially altered by the an- 
nouncement of Mr. Montagu's visit, it was Mr. Tilak ; 
with his unerring judgment, he clearly saw that what- 
ever concessions Mr. Montague would be incUned to 
make would, to a considerable extent, be negatived by 
the reactionary forces at work in India and England ; 



248 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and that the only way of not only strengthening the 
hands of the Secretary of State for India bur also of sti- 
mulating his generosity and sense of justice was an 
effective appeal to the British Democracy. There were 
those who argued that this was hardly the time to thrust 
our grievances upon the attention of our distracted and 
well-nigh disappointed rulers. Mr. Tilak begged to 
differ from them. Though not prepared to hold that" 
" England's difficulty is our opportunity " he saw 
nothing wrong in drawing Britain's urgent attention to 
the easiest way of enlisting India's vast man-power in 
their cause. Side by side, therefore, with the work of 
organizing our resources and formulating the demands 
to be placed before the Viceroy and the Secretary of 
State, he continued unabated the still more important 
task of awakening the people to a full consciousness of 
the supreme importance of his plan of campaign. 

Mr. Tilak's triumphant Home Rule tour was twice in- 
terrupted to suit the work of the moment. On November 
26th, the joint deputation of the Madras and Poona 
Home Rule Leagues waited on Lord Chelmsford and the 
Secretary of State and on the following day Mr. Tilak 
had a long interview with Mr. Montague. He was ex- 
tremely well-received and is said to have created a deep 
impression on the mind of the Secretary of State. May 
we add that the efforts of the latter to secure Mr. Tilak's 
full support to the impending reforms were all unavail- 
ing? 

f;!*, The Calcutta session of the National Congress under 
the Presidentship of Mrs. Besant called forth all the 
statesmanship of Mr. Tilak. The Declaration of August 
20th, 1917, had in a sense, created a great muddle in the 



•* RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 249 

political situation. The Congress-League scheme was 
drawn up on the basis of an irremovable executive. 
In all our agitation we had supported the Congress- 
League scheme. To change, even in one essential, the 
scheme which was formulated with great care and 
caution would have opened a flood-gate of amendments 
and the unity of the Congress would have been weaken- 
ed by dissensions. Mr. Tilak, therefore, suggested that 
until the Government scheme of Reforms was out, we 
should stick to the one which had evoked the unani- 
mous support of the people. There was time enough to 
decide, after the Government pubHshed its report on 
constitutional reforms, whether in the light of the official 
proposals, the Congress-League scheme should be 
modified or not. 

A welcome step in advance was the insertion of a 
time-limit in the Resolution of Swaraj. 

While Mr. Tilak was straining every nerve to collect 
funds for the Home Rule League Deputation, the model 
Moderates were gradually being won over and were im- 
pressed with the necessity of supporting any scheme 
of reforms that would be placed before the Parliament. 
When we remember, how eager our Moderate friends are 
for co-operation with the Government, which sometimes 
means quiet submission to the bureaucratic will; when 
we remember how the unmeaning reforms of 1909 were 
praised as " generous and just/' need we wonder that 
the Moderates raUied round the banner of the Viceroy 
and the Secretary of State ? Those who know some- 
thing of the inner history of Indian Pohtics during the 
few months preceding the pubhcation of the Mont-ford 
Report are well aware of the specific purpose for which 



250 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the Liberal League was started at Calcutta under the 
presidency of the Hon'ble Mr. Surendranath Banerjea, 
The circulars sent by the Secretaries of the League all 
over Bengal, calling upon people to be fully prepared to 
study the forthcoming report " impartially and without 
any prejudice " and to accept the scheme even when it 
fell short of our expectations, prove beyond all doubt 
that many of the Moderates had determined to secede 
from the Congress even before the publication of the 
Report. In their beggarly impatience to get something 
without any risk, they decided to abandon the Congress, 
for they fully anticipated what the reception of the 
Report would be. Instead of calling upon the Nation 
to stand up, firm and strong, these Moderates began to 
send round mysterious whispers; and for the sake of a 
few crumbs of Self-Government they were willing to dis- 
card that unity which in spite of occasional tension, had 
prevailed since 1915, in the politics of the country. It 
was in this atmosphere of secrecy and conspiracy on 
the one hand and suspicion and distrust on the other 
that the Report, long awaited was published (July 
1918). 

The distrust with which the generality of the people 
looked to the publication of the Report was due to a 
number of significant events of which the nth hour 
cancellation of the passports of Mr. Tilak and his col- 
leagues was not the least important. It was daily becom- 
ing clearer and clearer that a reactionary element was at 
work, both here and in England and that it was useless to 
expect a satisfactory settlement of our grievances so long 
as these reactionaries were allowed to run amuck. 
People had expected that Mr. Montague would attend 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 251 

the War Conference at Delhi and make some inspiring' 
pronouncement. He did nothing of the kind. To the 
War Conference held under the Presidency of the 
Viceroy neither Mrs. Besant nor Mr. Tilakwas invited. 
The Self-Government resolution proposed by the Hon'ble 
Mr. Khaparde was ruled out of order. The Conference 
was all an ofBcial show and hence proved a complete 
failure. Nor was the mistake rectified at Bombay 
where Lord Willingdon inflicted on his audience a severe 
sermon on Home Rulers, whose bona fides he called into 
question. Mr. Tilak was called upon to speak but was 
not allowed to make a mention of Home Rule and had 
to stop. More significant than all these were the rumoured 
recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee which 
were intended as a set off against the proposals contain- 
ed in the Montford-Report. The notorious Rowlatt 
report, so disastrous to the cause of Indian Liberty, was 
equally damaging to Mr. Tilak, the course of whose 
action against Sir Valentine Chirol it was likely to in- 
fluence profoundly. 

The Montford-Report was condemned by the majority 
of educated Indians. Mr. Tilak characterized it as a 
*' sunless dawn." Mrs. Besant held that the poUtical 
reforms indicated in the Report were unworthy of 
England to give and of India to take. The Hon'ble 
Mr. Patel showed how in certain details the report had 
made retrograde proposals. Mr. N. C. Kelkar prono- 
unced the proposals as cruelly disappointing and 
** almost a wicked attempt to let Indian leaders be 
stewed in their own juice." The Hon'ble Mr. B. Cha- 
krabarty said that throughout the report, the fetish 
of peace, order and good Government was worshipped. 



-252 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Prof. Jitendralal Banerjea declared that the reforms 
were grudging, half-hearted, meagre, inadequate and 
hence disappointing and abortive ; while the veteran 
Dr. Subrahmanyam Ayer advised his countrymen not 
4:0 touch the narcotic that was offered to them. 

To place " the essentials of the Congress-League 
scheme within the frame -work of the Montague-Chelms- 
ford Report " so that neither the fire-eaters of the Ex- 
-tremist Party nor the cautious members of the Mode- 
a:ate Party might find reasonable cause for grumbling 
was an extremely difficult and dehcate work. Much 
of the credit of having restrained the fury of the " Ex- 
tremists " can be claimed by Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant. 
" If your cavalry charges a-head brilliantly, galloping 
on the foe, without the preparation of the artillery, with- 
out the support of the infantry, what will happen ? 
The enemy will meet them in their charge, will find 
-them unsupported, will mow them down separated 
from the main body of the host, and then, having anni- 
hilated the cavalry, he would advance across the grounds 
left empty to annihilate the infantry in its turn." Mr. 
Tilak was in complete accord with these sentiments of 
Mrs. Besant and co-operated with her in trying to pre- 
vent the Moderates from seceding. 

Knowing that he would be required to do the work of 
a Peace-maker, Mr. Tilak, with rare self-effacement re- 
fused to accept the Presidentship of the Special Session 
of the Congress. Even when the Moderates definitely 
parted company and, in the language of Sir Dinshaw 
Petit " collected round them some people who never 
took part in politics except grind their own axes " and 
sought to have a separate Conference of their own, Mr. 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 2SS 

Tilak was desirous of keeping the door open for their re- 
turn to the Congress Camp. On the fourth day of the 
Congress (September ist 19 18), the Resolution on the 
Reform Scheme was moved by (the Hon'ble) Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya in a closely-reasoned speech 
which will go down to future generations as a historic 
and statesmanlike pronouncement. (The Hon'ble) Sir 
Dinshaw M, Petit, the distinguished Parsi millionaire 
seconded the Resolution in a lucid speech which descri- 
bed how "the Resolution dispels the fear of some of 
our friends and shatters the hope of our enemies that 
the Congress was going to reject the seheme without 
discussing its merits or demerits." Eleven leading 
Congressmen supported the Resolution. Pandit Motilal 
Nehru showed how the Congress was " able to perform 
the impossible feat of uniting its appreciation, recogni- 
tion, and in plain English, its condemnation " of the 
Montague-Chelmsford Report. Mr. Fazlul Haq proved 
how " though we hear of the change of the angle of 
vision, it is either an obtuse angle or an acute angle 
but never the right angle." Mr. Jayakar showed how 
the " taint of the school-master "was responsible for the 
"periodic examinations "set for the Indian people. Mrs. 
Besant wound up the discussion in an impassioned 
speech. Speaking to the Resolution, Mr, Tilak said : — 

" What we have tried to do in the Subjects' Com- 
mitee is to distil our different opinions, and it was very 
difficult to distil " the gourds and the cucumbers " 
together. It was no easy task ; even our enemies had 
considered it to be difficult. They believed that we 
were engaged in an impossible business and that by 
the beginning of September the Congress would be no- 



:254 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

where. Unfortunately for them, their predictions have 
not proved true. So long as the spirit of forbearance 
and the spirit of give-and-take pervades in the Councils 
of the Congress such a fatal contingency is never likely 
to arise. 

" We were told that the Congress was going to reject 
ihe whole scheme. I could never understand and have ne- 
ver understood what it meant. We are in the midst of our 
negotiations. If you reject the scheme you have done 
with it. What are you then going to tell the British 
people ? " That we reject the scheme ?" I think 
that we have learnt enough of poHtics to know that it is 
absurd to take such a position. Fortunately for all, we 
have been able to place before you a reasoned document, 
a resolution, which combines the wisdom of one 
party, I may say, the temperament of another party, 
and if you like to call it, I do not like to call it myself — 
the rashness of a third party. 

" The Montague Report is a beautiful, very skilful and 
statesmanlike document. We asked for eight annas of 
Self-government; that report gives us one anna of Res- 
ponsible Government and says that it is better than the 
eight annas of Self-Govemment. The whole Uterary 
skill of the Report lies in making us beheve that one 
morsel of Responsible Government is more than suffi- 
cient to satisfy our hunger for Self-government. We 
now plainly say to the Government, * we thank you for 
the one anna of Responsible Government but in the 
scheme we want to embody, not all that is embodied in 
the Congress-League scheme, the rails might be 
different but the carriages that carry passengers might 
be transferred from one rail to another. This is what 



*' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 255 

we have tried to do and we have tried to satisfy all 
parties concerned and a very difficult task has been 
accomplished. The future way is clear and I hope that 
what we have done will be of material help in carrying 
on this fight to the end." 

The moderation and good sense of the special session 
of the Congress disarmed all opposition and many of the 
seceders returned to the old camp at Delhi (December 
1918) where, however, in the absence of Mr. Tilak, a 
variety of circumstances conspired to foment those 
dissensions which have, ever since, made Indian PoUtics 
such a hopeless tangle. Neither the rancour nor the 
differences bom of the Delhi Congress has been allayed 
or made up. On the contrary, the bitterness has been 
further intensified by succeeding events, — the passing 
of the Rowlatt Act in the teeth of Indian opposition^ 
the campaign of Civil Disobedience started by Mahatma 
Gandhi, the irresponsible acts of Government's agents, 
culminating in the shocking Punjab tragedy with all 
its long and interminable sequal. All this while, Mr. 
Tilak was a passive though deeply interested observer 
in distant London. 

While Mr. Tilak was on his way to England, he was 
unanimously elected President of the Delhi Congress. 
This was the considered reply which the Nation 
gave to the prohibitionary order issued by Lord Willing- 
don. While the Bureaucracy lost no opportunity of 
discrediting him, our hero was the recipient of the 
highest honours at the disposal of his admiring country* 
men. 



## THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 

I have had many opportunities of exchanging views with Mr. 
Tilak during his stay in England, and every time that I have 
spoken with him, I have felt that he was truly a statesman and 
not a mere politician. The way in which he was able to take a 
sane view of the Indian situation in Britain, within a few days 
of his arrival in this country (England) made me marvel at his 

perspicuity 

St. Nihal Sing 

IVTEVER abject, never fanatical, Mr. Tilak's methods 
of political agitation were a unique combination of 
manliness, astuteness and a sense of proportion. He 
disdained the constant waitings, never-ending mendi- 
cancy that characterised the efforts of some of the ex- 
treme Moderates. On the other hand, he kept clear 
from the noxious weed of anarchism. Within these 
two clearly -defined limits, he was willing to work in any 
way, if he was sure of the wisdom of the path. He was^ 
" an operator, a co-operator, and a non-co-operator.'* 
He liked to vary his means with changes in circum- 
stances. In 1904, he had spoken to a Congress resolu- 
tion supporting political deputations to England. He 
was, then, anxious to rouse the Moderate leaders from 
their dangerous slumber and when the Congress Depu- 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 25/ 

tation was sent to England, he intended to start a vigo- 
rous agitation in India to back it up. With the Parti- 
tion of Bengal came a change. Public opinion in India 
was roused to an intense pitch. Appeals were made to 
England. They were unheeded. The people lost their 
faith in the good intentions of England. At this time, 
the question of sending deputations to England was 
raised ; but now Mr. Tilak opposed the idea. The 
Nationalist Party wanted to force England's attention 
to India by means of a vigorous Boycott movement. 
In this programme of Boycott, deputations had no place. 
Ten eventful years passed and the times were changed. 
The India of 19 17 was not the India of 1907. New 
forces were at work, not only in India but all the world 
over. The war of ' Liberty ' had transformed the civi- 
lised world, estabUshed India's necessity to England 
and extorted from the most bigoted Anglo-Indians 
and English men and women tributes to India's loyalty 
and India's heroism. This was, indeed, the time to 
press our claims on the grateful attention of England, 
open her eyes to India's grievances and to the valour 
strength and ability lying unused, discouraged and put 
down by the suspicions of the Bureaucrats in India. 
" Now is the time when a political mission ought to be 
established in England '* said Mr. Tilak. " We must 
cease to be parochial. Our earliest activities were 
merely local and isolated. Then they became provin- 
cial and then National. Now is the time to plunge 
into international currents of thought and life, realise 
our ideal, and to convince the world that India is seri- 
ously after attaining her highest not only in National life 
but in the international affairs as weU". 
17 



258 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

The old guard of the Moderate Party could not mus- 
ter up courage to ** pinprick " the British Lion in the 
midst of his struggle. Mrs. Besant, however, cordially 
supported Mr. Tilak, for she knew the value of world- 
propaganda. In the Lucknow Congress, Mr. Tilak's 
scheme for a vigilant Executive for the Congress was 
ruled out of order. His persistent attempts to get the 
sanction of the Congress for a strong deputation met 
with tardy and nominal success. A deputation was 
agreed upon ; but every excuse was found for delay ; and 
when at last, procrastination was impossible, was recei- 
ved the cable of Sir WilUam Wedderbum advising 
delay. In the meanwhile, judgment in England was 
going against us by default. The Sydenham group 
was busy as ever ; India's " representatives " like the 
Maharaja of Bikaner declared that India wanted not 
Swaraj but only a little dose of Reforms ; the tide of 
repression was merrily flowing in. Finding the big 
Moderate guns immoveable, Mr. Tilak sent out the inde- 
fatigable and enterprising Mr. Baptista for pioneer 
work in England. The goodwill and co-operation of 
the Labour Party was secured ; and yet a well-organised 
propaganda was to be carried on. In the meanwhile, Mr. 
Montague himself had come over to India to look into 
India's grievances ; this was a further excuse for delay. 
At last both Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant decided to send 
their own " Home Rule Deputations " to England and 
herein they were wise, as later, the All-India Congress 
Committee decided not to send out a deputation until 
the Montague Report was out and the Special Session 
of the Congress had pronounced India's verdict there- 
upon. 



THE MISSION TO EKGLAND 259*- 

It was this suicidal and unstatesmanlike dilatoriness 
that Mr. Tilak strongly disliked. " You will never 
&id " said he, "a better opportunity of arousing the 
slumbering conscience of the average Britisher. When 
even Mr. Bonar Law advises the colonies to strike when 
the iron is hot, surely, we shall be faiUng in our duty, if 
we don't take up the hint.*' The usual Indian claims 
for Swaraj, he argued, are based upon sentimental 
appeals to English Liberalism or compassion. Now, 
is the opportunity to show how England can save herself 
by saving India, become great herself by giving India 
the opportunity to regain her pristine glory. He want* 
«d to tell the Enghsh Democracy how their representa- 
tives in India had kept the children of the soil under 
their heels, prostrate, starving and emasculated and how 
the tonic of Swaraj if given now, would still enable 
India to do fuU justice to her ambition of helping Bri- 
tain. This was the message which Mr. Tilak wanted 
to deHver in England. It was dignified,lofty and 
wholesome. 

Since the entry of the capitalistic class into the 
field of politics, the difficulty of collecting funds is not 
acutely felt. Yet Mr. Tilak always preferred to have 
small contributions from many to a big donation from 
one. " I should like to have 64 pice from as many 
persons instead of one rupee from one." he said ; and 
on this principle he set about collecting funds for the 
Home Rule Deputation. He made extensive tours in 
Belgaum, Nasik, Sholapur, Thana, and Kolaba dis- 
tricts, where along with the inevitable addresses and 
processions, large purses were presented to him. His 
tour in the Central Provinces and Berar was from this 



260 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

standpoint the grandest, the most successful because 
well organised. During a short period of little less 
than three weeks (Feb. 1918) he delivered lectures at 
30 places and collected one hundred and fifty thousand 
Rupees, He travelled one thousand miles by motor 
and an equal distance by railway. It was a triumph of 
will power pure and simple; for his body, old, weakened 
and ailing was utterly unable to bear the strain. 

In a monemt of exhaustion he once said '* People 
can't possibly realise that I feel so weak. When the 
moment comes I lecture. But the body is all the while 
breaking under the strain. The lecture over, I retire 
from the crowds and sleep over my fatigue. Only my 
will supports me. The body is done up." Extensive 
tours — especially those that call forth constant crowds 
and require frequent lectures try the strength of the 
youngest and the most energetic. Mr. Tilak at 61 did 
not hesitate to undertake a long and busy tour, prepara- 
tory to his voyage to England. What an iron will he 
had! 

The Home Rule Deputation was turned back from 
Colombo at the last moment and Mr. Tilak had to wait 
for some time more. In the meanwhile his defamation 
suit against Sir Valentine Chirol was hanging fire ; 
finding that it could not reasonably be postponed, the 
Government had to permit Mr. Tilak to proceed to 
England. The Bureaucracy, however, took special care 
to send Mr. Tilak with a gag on his mouth and a slur on 
his loyalty. He was required to give a pledge that he 
would not address any meetings while in England and 
a couple of months before Mr. Tilak proceeded to 
England he was prohibited from speaking in India with- 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26l 

•out the previous permission of the District Magistrate. 
The alleged reason was a speech supposed to discourage 
recruiting. Mr. Tilak was too busy with his legal and 
other work to attempt to speak in India. But the 
undertaking he was required to give as regards his 
silence in England was evidently very inconvenient. 
He had to give it which he did under protest. But the 
first thing he did in England was to get the undertaking 
cancelled. Nor was this very difficult. If Dr. Nair, 
who had given a similar undertaking could ^%t the per- 
mission of the British Cabinet to make speeches, why 
should not Mr. Tilak have the same ? Surely, what is 
sauce for goose is sauce for gander also. He did get 
the cancellation of the pledge, though of course, he was 
shrewd enough not to endanger his case in the Court by 
a too early appearance on the public platform. His 
failure in his suit against Sir Valentine Chirol was due 
largely to the prejudice created by the prohibition order 
of Lord Willingdon, the extemment orders from Delhi 
and Lahore, the untimely publication in England of the 
Rowlatt Report and by the pecuHarly perverted man- 
ner in which Sir Edward Carson made capital out of 
his two convictions for sedition. Whatever the reasons, 
the result was certainly disastrous not only to Mr. Tilak 
individually, but to his cause as well. 

In the meanwhile, Mr. Tilak had already commenced 
his self-imposed task of reorganizing the British Con- 
gress Committee and the affairs of the India. Both 
the Committee and the newspaper owe their existence 
to the need felt, ever since the birth of the Congress, of 
educating the English public, whose ignorance about 
jndia was — and unfortunately still is — almost pheno- 



-2^2 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

menal. A humorous story is told illustrative of this- 
ignorance. It was the day following the death of Lord 
Northbrook. Two Englishmen were travelling in a 
railway carriage. " One of them, looking through the 
news columns of the paper in his hand, quietly asked 
* Who is this Lord Northbrook that snipped off yester- 
day ?' ' Who knows ? * said his equally indifferent 
companion " May be some relation of Lord Cromer '/* 
It was to counter-act the evil effects of such abysmal 
ignorance of Englishmen even about persons sent out 
to India as Viceroys, that the British Congress Commit- 
tee was started in 1889 and the newspaper India in 
1890. As long as the Congress was a united body con- 
trolled by Moderate leaders with whom the Congress 
Committee was in general agreement, there was no 
difficulty. But now came a change . The Moderates 
had seceded from the Congress; and the Congress 
Committee and its weekly organ were still the monopoly 
of the British friends of the Moderates ; the result 
was that though the Congress supported the journal and 
spent nearly Rs. 30,000 annually on the work of the 
Committee, the policy of India was antagonistic 
to that of the Congress. Mr. Polak whose evident 
leanings towards the Moderates, ill fitted him for his 
editorial work under the changed circumstances, had 
not, Mr. Tilak was astonished to find, cared to publish 
even the Resolutions of the Special Congress (1918). 

Mr. Tilak, though the chosen President of the Delhi 
Congress, was not the bearer of any mandate from the 
Congress. So he found it very difficult to carry on his 
work with the Congress Committee and India. The 
reactionary element in the Committee assumed a lofty 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 263 

attitude and claimed to be wiser than the Congress. 
Even for such a simple thing as attending the meeting 
of the Committee, Mr. Tilak had to move heaven and 
earth. He received insults at every turn and ** was 
made to feel that he was a busy-body." Fortunately 
for him, the Delhi Congress took up the question of re- 
organizing the work in England. The Congress Depu- 
tation was specially charged with this work ; and until 
order was brought out of chaos, supplies were witheld. 
Still, Mr. Polak and his friends in the Committee went 
on with their even course ; and under one pretext or 
another, the work was postponed indefinitely. There 
were three persons among the Directors who could not 
tolerate these dilatory tactics of Mr. Polak. So, " Dr. 
Clark, Dr. Rutherford and Mr. Parekh, as Directors of 
the India asked the acting editor whether or not, 
he could conscientiously support the Congress policy." 
Mr. Polak at once declared that he was no longer res- 
ponsible for the editorial control of the paper. After 
his resignation, Miss Normanton became editor and 
was guided in her work by Mr. N, C. Kelkar during 
the period he was in England. 

In his task of re-organizing the Congress Committee 
Mr. Tilak was considerably helped by Dr. Clark and his 
followers, who, in spite of the opposition of several ex- 
Presidents of the Congress, adopted a new Constitution 
in August 1919. By this change in the Constitution, 
only persons in thorough agreement with the Congress 
policy could become the members of the British Congress 
Committee. The rest had to resign. 

It will be thus seen that after nearly one year's persist- 
ent work, Mr. Tilak triumphed. When Mr. Tilak left 



264 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

for England, there were many well-meaning persons who 
had expressed their doubt as to whether, Mr. Tilak had 
at that advanced age the necessary elasticity of spirit to 
do the difificult and delicate work undertaken by him. 
They admired Mr. Tilak's ability but evidently thought 
that " an oak can't be transplanted at sixty." But by 
his adroitness in dealing with men and affairs, Mr. 
Tilak fully proved that though his body was old, his 
heart was ever young. 

The spadework done by Mr. Joseph Baptista since 
August 1917 was of invaluable use to Mr. Tilak. At 
the Labour Party Conference at Nottingham (Jan. 23rd 
1918) the Party had pledged itself to assist {India) in 
every possible way in her efforts to win Home Rule. Mr. 
Tilak cultivated the friendship of Labour leaders and 
the confidence they placed in him and the Congress 
Deputation was so great, that they agreed to move in 
Parliament amendments to the Government of 
India Bill in spite of Mrs. Besant's best endeavours to 
dissuade them from so doing. His alliance with the 
Labour party was of great use to the party itself espe- 
cially in its efforts to bring out the Herald as a 
daily paper. 

At the same time, Mr. Tilak did not neglect what- 
ever aid and co-operation he could derive from the 
moribund Liberal Party. 

It was Mr. Tilak 's earnest desire to bring about per- 
fect unanimity amongst all the important deputations, 
then in England. He believed in unity more than in 
any other thing and tried his best to win over Mrs, 
Besant and the Moderate leaders. He appealed to Mrs. 
Besant to forget all the bitterness of the Delhi Congress 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 265 

and so chalk out her course as to bring about unity. But 
she and the Moderate leaders were pledged to support the 
Reforms. No doubt they talked of slight improvements, 
here and there ; but they made no secret of their inten- 
tion of accepting whatever reforms were granted. 
Probably they were afraid of reactionaries of the type 
of Lord Sydenham and considered it to be the height 
-of statesmanship to run no risks. They wanted to 
strengthen the hands of Mr. Montague. Mr. Tilak on 
the contrary knew full well that it was to establish its 
credit with the civilized nations that England was grant- 
ing us Reforms. Mr. Montague was as anxious to give 
as we were to take. Why not ask for more ? The phi- 
losophy of Moderation said " Half a loaf is better 
than none." Mr. Tilak was prepared, if need 
be, to risk the loss of the proferred half in his 
endeavours to get three-quarters. He believed more in 
winning than in receiving. It was, therefore, psycho- 
logically impossible that the Moderates should come 
over to his side. Not only were they unwiUing to 
join hands with him in the matter of Reforms, but even 
regarding the Punjab situation. Several members of 
the Congress Deputation approached prominent members 
of the Moderate Deputation but with no result. The 
efforts of the British Congress Committee were also 
unavailing. 

Mr. Tilak did his best to " educate the British Demo- 
cracy " by means of speeches and writings. Mr. Tilak's 
^ortcomings as a speaker have been noticed by many 
unsympathetic critics. It is worth remembering there- 
fore, that many of his speeches were greatly appreci- 
ated by the British audiences. Mr. Tilak never appealed 



266 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to passions, but always to reason. The average English 
man is a hard-headed man. Appeal to his common- 
sense and he is won over ; and Mr. Tilak's appeals were 
always directed to his head. It is not, therefore, sur- 
prising that Mr. Tilak's speeches created a favourable 
impression on those who heard him. 

Mr. Saint Nihal Singh thus describes a speech by Mr. 
Tilak : — 

" Of all these addresses, the one that I like best was 
the one that Mr. Tilak delivered at the Caxton HaU 
while sitting in a chair, because he had sprained his 
ankle. Mr. Tilak outlined the conditions existing in 
India in olden times, referring to the aceounts of the 
wealthy, prosperous enlightened India left by foreign 
travellers. He asked the audience particularly to note 
the vast extent of the Indian Empire ruled over by 
Asoka and Samudra Gupta. He went on to relate 
that our country in those days, not only possessed a 
wealth of religious and philosophical literature but was 
industrially great and self-sufficing in every respect, 
able to satisfy all her material and artistic wants. 

** Passing from the pleasant picture of ancient India, 
Mr. Tilak gave a graphic description of India to-day, 
with her millions of sons and daughters who, because 
of appaling poverty, never know what it is to have 
the pangs of hunger stilled. He told how the East India 
Company had deliberately killed our industries, throw- 
ing the whole weight of population upon agriculture. 

" Taking up the political question, Mr. Tilak assured 
the audience, that Indians were not anti-British, — they 
were only ' anti-Bureaucracy ' They desired the Bri- 
tish connection to continue. 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26/ 

" Then Mr. Tilak shattered, one by one, the arguments 
advanced against granting Self-government to India. 
The Bureaucrats, he said, were themselves responsible 
for iUiteracy in India, While deploring caste and ac- 
knowledging that it required radical modification, he 
denied that it constituted a reason for refusing self- 
Govemment. The British, he pointed out, quarreled 
among themselves quite as much as Indians did. There 
was no Ulster in India — Hindus and Mushms were 
agreed concerning the constitutional reforms. He 
challenged the statement that Indians did not desire 
Home Rule. He demanded to know why, India alone, 
of aU the British oversea units, should be expected to 
achieve Self-government ' step by step '. That phrase 
had no meaning in this age of progress. Indians should 
immediately be given control over their purely domestic 
civil affairs." 

This was, in brief, the line of reasoning adopted by 
Mr. Tilak in convincing and winning over the British 
Democracy. He, however, did not confine his activi- 
ties merely to speeches. He sent out contributions to 
the Press and published several pamphlets and leaflets. 
In England, Mr. Tilak found that in spite of the so-called 
liberty and independence of the Press, the great Fourth 
Estate is practically manipulated and controlled by a 
few groups of politicians most of whom are quite insular 
in their outlook. Though swayed by " empire hunger '* 
these politicians care very little for the true interests of 
the empire. English Liberalism is essentially a 
* white ' Liberalism. It is not intended for the Black 
or the Brown. The English Press, therefore cares very 
little for India, so much so that not only are weD in- 



^68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

formed contributions on Indian Affairs unwelcome but 
even paid advertisements of Indian meetings are not 
always accepted. 

In the general election of 1918, Mr. Tilak was busy 
drawing the attention of English men and women to 
the problems of India. He issued four leaflets " each 
consisting of a page tastefully printed on one side only." 
Thousands of copies of these leaflets were distributed 
during the electioneering campaign. 

Mr. Tilak 's pamphlet on " Self-determination " at- 
tracted much notice. It was sent to hundreds of states- 
men and politicians in England and abroad. Similarly 
his petition to the President of the Peace Conference as 
an elected representative of the Congress, was widely 
read. Of this no fewer than a lakh of copies were 
issued. Besides these, a number of stray publications 
sought to attract England's attention to the cause of 
India. 

** On August 6th, Mr. Tilak, on behalf of the Indian 
Home Rule League, of which he was the President, ap- 
peared before the Joint Parliamentary Committee of 
the two Houses, set up to consider the Government of 
India Bill, and was asked by Lord Selbourne, the Chair- 
man, to make any statement that he cared to make to 
supplement the answers that he had given to the list 
of questions compiled by the Committee. Speaking 
without hesitation, in clear theough rather low tones, 
Mr. Tilak declared that the League in behalf of which 
he appeared, had accepted the Declaration of August 20, 
1917, in regard to His Majesty's Government's policy in 
India, though he and his colleagues put their own con- 
struction upon the latter part of the Declaration, which 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26^ 

left the pace at which India should proceed towards Res- 
ponsible Government, to the authorities in White Hall to 
determine in consultation with the Government of India. 
They took the view that the proposals put forward by 
the Secretary of State and the Viceroy were not neces- 
sarily the corollary to the pronouncement. A much 
larger measure of Self-Govemment could be given to 
Indians without in any way going against the spirit of 
the British policy as laid down in that Declaration. la 
fact, even the Congress-League Scheme provided for 
advance by stages, though the stages would be fewer 
than they would be under the Montague-Chelmsford 
scheme. He also insisted that it was necessary that a 
time-limit be fixed in the statute for the attainment by 
India of fully Responsible administration. The term of 
15 years fixed by the Congress might appear arbitrary 
but it was reasonable. 

*' Mr. Tilak also claimed that Indians were fully fit 
for administering Provinces, and that they should be 
given Provincial Autonomy. He also declared that 
Responsibility in the Central Government was absolute- 
ly necessary. He suggested that at least those depart- 
ments in the Central Government which dealt with 
affairs which in the case of the provinces were considered 
fit to be transferred to popular control, should be placed 
under responsible Ministers, That could be done with- 
out resorting to diarchy. The Congress and the League 
had suggested a scheme for that purpose, and had provi- 
ded sufficient safeguards. 

" Mr. Tilak claimed that good materials for elector- 
ates existed in India. Indeed, he went so far as to state 
that one word from the officials could create elctorates. 



270 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Above all, he wished to see the officials deprived of the 
initiative for inaugurating large policies that they at pre- 
sent possessed, and reduced to the status of permanent 
servants in Britain and other countries. Such initiative 
should only be exercised by the people's representatives. 
Lastly, he considered the inclusion of a Declaration of 
Rights in the Statute was absolutely necessary "*. 

After thee ompletion of the above oral statement it 
was naturally expected that Mr. Tilak would be cross- 
examined by the several members of the Committee, 
and as it was further expected that the cross-examina- 
tion of Mr. Tilak would particularly be lively, the Com- 
mittee-room was crowded to its utmost capacity. But 
it was soon announced that the Committee did not in- 
tend to trouble Mr. Tilak with questions. This particu- 
lar soUcitude for Mr. Tilak was evidently the off- 
spring of prejudice. It is said that when the name of 
Mr. Tilak was sent to the Committee to represent the 
Indian Home Rule League, Lord Selboume asked the 
members of the Committee whether Mr. Tilak was to be 
allowed to make a statement. The majority of the 
members were strongly against hearing Mr. Tilak, but 
none of them could hit upon some specious pretext on 
which he was to be rejected. They, therefore, had to 
allow him to appear before them, but as they did not like 
to tolerate his presence more than was absolutely neces- 
sary, they *non-co-operated* with him by refusing to put 
him questions. This childish conduct of the Committee 
shows the deep prejudice with which even the better mind 
of England regarded the greatest of Indians then Hving. 

* Mr. Tilak's work in England (St. Nihal Singh ; Modern 
Review October 191 9). 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 27! 

When the Joint Parliamentary Committee had finish- 
ed its labours and the passing of the Government of 
India Bill had been duly ensured, Mr. Tilak hastened 
back to India. He left England on October 30th, 19 19 
and reached Bombay, hale and hearty, on 27th Novem- 
ber 1919, just a month before the Amritsar Con- 
gress. Some of his opponents have said that his mis- 
sion to England broadened his outlook. Mr. Tilak never 
required any contact with England to broaden his 
vision for the simple reason that his outlook was never 
parochial. His Ufe in England only deepened his 
faith in foreign propaganda and he intended to take the 
earliest opportunity of establishing permanent poUti- 
cal missions at London, Paris and New York. 

An esteemed friend and associate of Mr. Tilak refers 
to his work in England in the following admiring lan- 
guage :— 

" Then again Mr. Tilak had to fight against 

great odds, before the Deputation arrived, in the matter 
of getting the London public to properly understand 
and appreciate the Congress scheme of Reforms. At 
every meeting, he impressed his audience with his re- 
markably terse statement of facts and brilliant reason- 
ing. You all know what remarkable powers, Mr. 
Tilak possesses of narrowing down the issues in a con- 
troversy and I may say he had never before an opportu- 
nity, like the one he had in England, for displaying his 
powers of elucidating matters of controversy and 
standing erect upon his own platform among the ruins 
of his opponents. He had quite a large variety of op- 
ponents from the agressive Sinn Feiner and bona fide Re- 
volutionist in England, who would if he could, blast

the Indian constitutional workers with his supreme 
contempt — to the facile and plausible official exponent 
who dared appear on the pubUc platform to make 
the worse cause appear the better. But the final 
verdict of every audience Mr. Tilak addressed was that 
while with his peculiar subtlety and tactfulness, he put 
the Revolutionist out of Court, he made mince-meat 
of the official or semi-official propagandist. «...,...."

^T^HE late Mr. Gokhale used to describe how he was 
once humourously taken to task by an Executive 
Councillor for having made a seditious speech. On Mr. 
Gokhale*s denying having done so, a C. I. D. report of 
his speech was produced and both Mr. Gokhale and the 
Official laughed over the perversions and distortions 
contained in that report. It is not given to every 
public leader to be a persona grata with the Government, 
nor can he expect to have that constant communication 
with the highest officers which alone, can, if possible 
remove such misunderstandings. If in some future 
generation after the attainment of Swaraj, the historian 
of this period has access to confidential reports of the 
Government, he will be able to mention how hundreds 
18 



274 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

of persons had to suffer persecutions only because of 
the malice or ignorance of the C. I. D. reporters. Mr. 
Tilak's record with the Government will, in particular, 
shed curious light on the workings of numerous minds 
bent on crushing him by hook or crook. The revela- 
tions made in the correspondence, recently publish- 
ed by the Mahratta, between H. H. the Maharaja of 
Kolhapur on the one hand and a number of officials on 
the other have startled many a publicist and have 
afforded much side-light on the events which form the 
subject-matter of the correspondence. In his dealings 
with the Government, Mr. Tilak felt that the under- 
current of the Bureaucratic mind was poisoned by 
mischievous and malicious reports of his activities. But 
he was powerless to contradict or convince. He pa- 
tiently bore all the pricks of his position, buoyed up 
by the faith, that, the day of reckoning must come, 
sooner or later, and the misunderstandings that pre- 
judiced the powers that be, must ultimately melt like 
a mist. The pubUcation of the " Indian Unrest " by 
Sir Valentine Chirol, afforded Mr. Tilak the necessary 
opportunity of vindicating his loyalty and proving to 
the satisfaction of the world, the righteousness of his 
conduct and the truth and justice of his cause. In 
attacking Sir. Valentine Chirol's book, Mr. Tilak's 
chief object was surely to show how very prejudiced was 
the medium through which the Bureaucracy looked at 
him; for, in truth, " The Indian Unrest " — so far, at 
least, as it described the personaUty of Mr. Tilak — 
was a systematic exposition of the theories contained 
in the confidential papers of the Government concern- 
ing Mr. Tilak. 



TILAK — ^V — CHIROL "275 

Sir Valentine Chirol had been deputed in 1910 by 
the *' Times (London) " to study whether *' The lull in 
the storm of Indian Unrest *' indicated ** a gradual and 
steady return to more normal and peaceful conditions " 
or whether "as in other cyclonic disturbances in tro- 
pical climes it merely presaged fiercer outbursts yet to 
come "; whether " the blended policy of repression and 
concession (had) really cowed down the forces of crimi- 
nal disorder and rallied the representatives of Moderate 
t)pinion to the cause of sober and constitutional pro- 
gress or whether it had come too late, either permanent- 
ly to arrest the former or to restore confidence and 
courage to the latter*.'* This was a problem which Sir. 
Valentine Chirol set himself to study; and after a long and 
careful investigation he came to the conclusion that it 
was almost a misnomer to speak of Indian unrest, that 
it was confined only to Hindus living in the Urban 
areas of Mahratta Deccan, the Cental Provinces, Bengal 
and the Punjab and that with respect to such " repres- 
sion meant nothing more cruel than the application of 
surgery to diseased growths j" " and as " it is impossi- 
ble that we should ever concede to India the rights of 
Self-Go vemment, § " Sir Valentine suggested some 
minor changes of poUcy for the permanence of the 
British Rule and the well-being of India. 

Compare the wealth and abundance of Sir Valentine 
Chirol's materials with the poverty and littleness of his 
conclusions. The truth is that he saw things through 
the medium of prejudice. His method of investigation 
was entirely faulty and unhistorical. He has collected

§ Indian Unrest ; Page 332. * 



^6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the strongest and the most '^objectionable " passages 
from the '* Extremist " newspapers all over the 
country and has sought to give them an imaginary unity 
of time, place and purpose. If an Indian Chirol will 
follow a similar method, ransack the files of Anglo- 
Indian papers and select such passages as Sir Valentine 
had done, he will be able to give a picture of Anglo- 
Indian mentality at which, the author of the " Indian 
Unrest" would stand aghast. Fortunately, Sir Valentine 
Chirol has lived to find that " Self-Go vemment " for 
India is the goal of British ambition.The very gro- 
und on which he bases his conclusions is thus swept 
away and what remains is nothing but the manifesta- 
tions of Tilak-phobia. The book sought to eternally 
discredit Mr. Tilak and his party in the eyes of England 
and prevent the Nationalists from raising their head 
again. Here, also, Sir Valentine failed and has lived to 
witness his failure. To-day he must be finding that 
the principles for which Mr. Tilak fought have been ac- 
cepted by almost all his countrymen and if Britain 
cherishes any prejudice towards the National Party, 
— well, Britain will regret the attitude, some day or 
other. 

To counteract the insidious poison of Sir. Valentine 
Chirols' writings, Mr. Tilak, after having taken the 
best legal advice in England and India, filed a suit 
against the offending party for damages against libel 
and for an injunction to restrain publication of the 
defamatory matter. After a long series of preliminary 
proceedings, the case came for hearing before Mr. 
Justice Darling and a Special Jury on 29th January 
1919, Sir John Simon, K.C., and Mr. E. F. Spence, 



TILAK — V — CHIROL. ^*J^ 

appeared for the plaintiff and Sir Edward Carson; 
assisted by two others, defended Sir V. Chirol, the 
writer, and Messrs. Macmillan and Comapany, the 
Publishers of the " Indian Unrest." 

Mr. Tilak complained that Sir V. Chirol had libelled 
him in six different ways. Though he had never start- 
ed, nor had ever been a subscriber to any cow-pro- 
tection society, he was charged with having started the 
organisation as a provocative to the Mahomedans. 
Though he had never organised gymnastic societies, he 
was accused of having done so with the object of 
developing the martial instincts of the people for 
the ultimate purpose of employing force. These 
gymnastic societies, have been also called " Juvenile 
bands of dacoits to swell the coffers of Swaraj*' Fur- 
ther, the High Court judgment (1910) in the Tai Maharaj 
^se was quoted by Sir. V. Chirol as being " extremely 
damaging to Tilak's private reputation as a man of 
honour or even of common honesty." 

Most important of all were the libels in connection 
•with the Rand-Ayerst and the Jackson murders : — 
, " What Tilak could do by secret agitation and by a 
rabid campaign in the Press to raise popular resentment 

to white-heat he did The inevitable 

consequences ensued. On June 27th, 1897 Mr. 

Rand and Lieut. Ayerst were shot 

down by a young Chitpawan Brahmin. No direct con- 
nection has been establishmed between the crime and 
Tilak." (Page 48 — Indian Unrest). 

" In reply to the Magistrate who asked him why he 
committed the murder, Kanhere said ' I read of many 
instances of oppression in the Kesari, the Rashtramat^ 



t^lS LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and the KaL and other newspaers. I think that by 
kilUng Sahibs we people can get justice. I never got 
injustice myself, nor did any one, I know of. I now 
regret killing Mr. Jackson. I killed a good man care- 
lessly.' 

** Can anything be more eloquent and convincing than 
the terrible pathos of this confession ? The three 
papers named by Kanhere were Tilak's organs. It was 
no personal experience or knowledge of his that had 
driven Kanhere to his frenzied deed, but the slow, per* 
sistent poison dropped into his ear by the Tilak Press. 
Though it was Kanhere's hand that struck down ' a 
good man carelessly' was not Tilak rather than 
Kanhere, the real author of the murder ? It was 
merely the story of the Poona murders of 1897 over 
again." (Page 62— Indian Unrest). 

The opening speech of Sir John Simon occupied seven 
hours. The plaintiff was next called to the witness- 
box and examined by Mr. Spence. When the examina- 
tion-in-chief was over, up jumped Sir Edward Carson to 
cross-examine Mr. Tilak. The Court was crowded to 
the utmost. An idea of the tussle between Sir Edward 
Carson, " the leader of Ulsterite rebels " and Mr. Tilak, 
the " the leader of Indian rebels " can be had from 
the following fragments of the latter's long and weari- 
some cross-examination which he stood extremely well. 

"When did you last get out of prison"? — June, 1914. 

" Have you taken any proceedings in India to vindi- 
cate your character "? — * No '. 

** Why did you come all the way to England to vindi- 
cate your character "? — 'Because, the book is read all- 
over the Empire and a decision of an English Court 






TILAK — V — CHIROL 27^ 

would have greater weight and be more efEective in 
stopping the circulation of the book.' 

" Do you remember being sentenced to six years^ 
transportation ?" — ' Yes '. 

" Do you remember what the Judge said in summing 
up ?"— ' Yes ' 

Sir Edward Carson then read this passage in which 
the Judge referred to the articles in the Kesari : — 

*' They are seething with sedition ; they preach 
violence ; they speak of murder with approval ; 
and the cowardly and atrocious act of commit- 
ting murders with bombs, not only meet with 
your approval, but you haul the advent of the 
bomb into India as if something had come to 
India for its good." 
Did the Judge say that ?"— ' Yes \ 
Was that the reason why you took no proceedings 
in India to vindicate your character ?" * No *. 

*' Can you point to any passage in Sir Valentine 
Chirol's book which is more severe than that ?" — * I 
complain of being associated with murder '. 

The plaintiff was asked to read a passage in which 
one of the men who were concerned with the murder of 
Mr. Jackson in 1909 said his mind was influenced by a 
certain book. The plaintiff said that the book was re- 
viewed in the Kesari. He did not write the review him- 
self. The book was a life of Mazzini and a translation 
in Marathi was dedicated to him. Many people dedi- 
cated books to him without his knowledge. 

" Do you see that the murderer says that it was by 
reading that book, that his mind was prepared for the 
murder ?'* * He may have said that *. 






«80 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

"Do you think that he committed a murder ?" — ' I 
heard that he had committed a murder. I don't know« 
I was in jail '* 

" Do you call it murder ?" — ' I should certainly call 
it murder/ 

" Did you not advocate resistance to the law ?"— 
Mf you don't like a law, you must resist it in order to 
get it altered. The penalty for resistance is punish- 
ment. That is called Passive Resistancre '. 

Sir Edward Carson read extracts from the plaintifE's 
newspaper Kesari and asked whether it was true that 
resistance to the Government was advocated. — 
' No ; it was resistance to the Government Officials ; I 
draw a distinction between them '. 

'* Government consists of Officials, doesn't it ?" — 
A house consists of rooms but a room does not mean 
a house '. (Laughter). 

" Was not Mr. Kingsford the man whom it was in- 
tended to kill, when two ladies with their coachman 
were murdered ?" — ' Yes, I believe so '. 

Extracts were read to show that the plaintiff's news- 
paper Kesari had used language which was likely to 
produce such a result. The witness denied it. He 
added that the newspaper was not even printed in the 
language spoken by the people where the murders were 
done and his newspaper did not circulate in that part 
of India. 

L^;Sir Edward Carson read further extracts with a view 
to show that the witness's newspaper encouraged the 
use of the bomb to bring about alterations in the system 
and administration of Government. The witness denied 
the inference. ;i 



TILAK — V — CHIROL 281 



t< 



The Times of India has said that your newspaper 
ibrought about the murder of Mr. Rand." Hadn't 
it ?'*— ' Yes '. 

'* Why didn't you bring action against the news- 
paper ?" — ' I went to Bombay for the purpose but I was 
arrested on the same day, so I couldn't do anything '. 

" Why did you not take proceedings when you came 
out of prison ?" — * I did and received an apology from 
the paper '. 

Sir Edward Carson read from a leading article in the 
Kesari dated June 21st, 1908, on which he relied partly 
to establish the plea of justification and asked the 
witness whether the article did not encourage the use of 
bombs. The witness denied this and said that the 
article merely pointed to the inevitable result of mis- 
government. On Sir Edward Carson reading further 
extracts, the witness denied that these passages con- 
tained any incitement. He said that he was explain- 
ing the conditions under which bomb outrages were 
likely to occur. He was simply setting forth the se- 
sequence of events and warning both the bomb-throw- 
ers and the officials of the danger of the situation. In 
course of his rephes the witess illustrated his point by 
mentioning the situation in Ulster. 

" Ulster can take care of itself. You won't gain 
anything by introducing personal matters." — ' It is no 
more a personal matter than the case of Russia is '. 

At a later stage replying to His Lordship the witness 
said there were some 200 races including castes in India 
professing five different religions. He did not want 
any one race or religion to be dominant. He wanted a 
democracy for all. 



282 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

His Lordship : — " Supposing there was an oppressed 
minority under Swaraj, would they be right in throwing 
bombs V* — * No man has a right to throw bombs \ 

'* Was it your opinion that it was the oppression of 
the administration of Mr. Rand during the Plague in 
Poona that led to his murder?" — 'I think that the 
measures adopted and their harshness led to the mur- 
der '. 

" Did you say in your newspaper that in the search of 
the houses, great tyranny was practised by the sol- 
diers ?"— ' I did \ 

" Did you say that they entered the temple,s brought 
out the women from their houses, broke idols and 
burnt holy books ?" — *I mentioned these facts. They 
are facts '. 

" Was it your opinion that Mr. Rand was more than 
a tyrant ?" — ■' I said that his measures were tyranni- 
cal '. 

Did you say that he was guilty of callous cruelty T* 
Yes. 

Yet you say that your writings had nothing to do 
with his murder ?" — ' The facts, not my doctrines led 
to the murder '. 

Later, Sir Edward Carson quoted a passage, which 
said that death cannot be avoided. He asked the 
meaning of that. The witness said that it was a quo- 
tation from a:reUgious book. It meant you are mortal. 

Mr. Justice Darling : — " What was the best thing 
Shivaji ever did ?" — ' He founded the Hindu Empire \ 

" Did he do it by kiUing Afzulkhan ?"— * That was 
one of the acts '. 

** Could he have done it without ?" — ' I can't say

that. Supposing we have a festival of Cromwell here, 
that does not mean we go on killing kings of England '. 

Turning to the report of a speech delivered by Mr. 
Tilak at the Shivaji festival in 1897, Sir Edward Carson, 
asked the witness what he meant by saying that great 
men are above the common principles of morality. The 
witness said that every day morality could not be ap- 
plied to the superman. 

*' Do you apply that doctrine to the Kaiser ?" — ' No. 
He was moved by an ambition to rule the whole world, 
which was wrong '. 

Asked to explain why an article in the form of an ex- 
hortation by Shivaji, had the Bhavani sword-mark ap- 
pended to it, the witness said Shivaji could not write 
and was accustomed to make his mark in the form of a 
sword. 

His Lordship : — " It appears to have been his trade- 
mark." 

In reply to a question from Sir Edward Carson wit- 
ness said that he advocated in his paper that children 
should be taught Swadeshi '. 

" Did you advocate that children should bum every- 
thing ?" — ' There was a bonfire and I said " You had 
better commence your vow by sacrificing something " 

" Was this to promote Anti-British feeling ?" — ' No '^ 

Mr. Justice Darling : — " Were the things burnt, 
things which you could have produced in India?" — 
' Yes, they were produced on a large scale '. 

" Did you do this to promote home industries ?'* 
' Yes, a kind of protection for home industries '. 

" Was there anything political in it ?" — ' Not until 
1905*. 



384 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

*' Why was it made political ?" — ' To bring pressure 
<}n the British Government '. 

Sir Edward Carson then referred to education in 
Swadeshi and the witness said that the Governor-Gene- 
ral declared on June 14th, 19 10, that one of the Schools 
was an unlawful institution. 

*' Was that kept by a friend of yours ?'* — * An ac- 
quaintance '. 

" Was that man convicted afterwards ?" — * Yes, of 
sedition '. 

"Is he still a friend of yours ?" — ' He is still an ac- 
quaintance '. 

" Most of your friends seem to have been convicted " 
■ — * No ; there are still some, who have not been '. 

Sir Edward Carson then referred to the murder of 
Mr. Jackson and asked whether some men (whose names 
quoted) were friends of the witness. Counsel inquired 
whether one man was still in his employment. 

The witness : — ' I think he is. I don't know. I am 
here '. 

" Don't be ashamed of him." — * I am not ashamed 
of him. When members, who have been convicted sit 
in Parliament, why should I be ashamed ?' — (Laughter). 

In opening the case for the defendants, Sir Edward 
Carson delivered an address which was conceived in 
bad taste. *' A man who had been twice convicted of 
sedition,~what character had he to vindicate ?" asked 
Sir Edward Carson. He said that the case must be 
considered as a whole. The main charges made by Sir 
V. Chirol against Mr. Tilak referred to the murders of 
Messrs. Rand and Jackson. If the defendant was right 
in saying that these were the results of the plaintiff's 



TILAK — V — CHIROL 285 

teachings, what became of the rest of the case ? During 
the Plague at Poona, Mr. Rand had to risk his Ufe daily 
on behalf of the afiflicted natives. His reward was that 
he met his death at the hands of an assassin and it was 
a fair inference that the murder was attributable to 
Mr. Tilak's utterances in the Kesari and the Mahratta, 
He (Mr. Tilak) denounced Mr. Rand as a " sullen, 
suspicious tyrant ", and even made the 
horrible accusation that Mr. Rand deUberately 
segregated people who were not suffering from Plague, 
in order to keep up the figures. British soldiers, who 
were risking their hves at is. a day, as volunteer sanitary 
workers, were held up as inhuman beings who would 
take advantage of the Plague to commit petty thefts 
and break idols. The whole tenor of Mr. Tilak's article 
could be summarized thus : — " Murder is right in cer- 
tain circumstances. It can be apologised for. Shivaji 
was right in murdering Afzulkhan, because Afzulkhan 
was an oppressor. So long as we don't murder from 
selfish motives, we are justified. Have we no Shivaji now ? 
Murder in such circumstances is no murder." Is it a 
wonder that a murder ensued ? 

Sir Edward Carson then rapidly touched the remain- 
ing four libels which, he said were trifles as compared to 
Tilak's authorship of the murders of Rand and Jackson. 

Sir John Simon in summing up the case said that the 
question was not whether the plaintiff was a person who, 
had, time and again, published seditious articles, or 
whether his strong, violent and unrestrained criticism 
of Government Officers was justified, nor was it the 
question whether Mr. Tilak had the friendship of 
Paranjpye and others. The question was whether Sir 



286 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

v. Chirol's book contained matter defamatory to the 
plaintiff. In dealing with the Rand and Jackson 
murders, Sir Edward Carson had made some strange 
omissions. Within a month of Mr. Rand's murder, 
Mr. Tilak, who according to Sir V. Chirol was the real 
author of the murder was prosecuted at Poona, not 
on any charge connected with the murder, but a charge 
of sedition, a striking fact, for the authorities had 
every means of knowing how far Mr. Tilak's writings 
were to blame. At that trial the Advocate-General 
and the Judge, both expressly disclaimed the idea of 
any connection between the articles and the murder. 
Secondly in the very month, in which the murder was 
committed, Lord Sandhurst had confirmed Mr. Tilak's 
election to the Legislative Council. Again when asked by 
Sir Edward Carson if he had ever taken proceedings 
against the Times of India, Mr. Tilak said he had— 
much to the discomfiture of the defendant. He took 
proceedings in Bombay and the Times of India came 
to the court and not only apologized but did what was 
very rare in Ubel actions — it went out of its way to give 
an assurance that the apology was genuine. Regarding 
the murder of Mr. Jackson, not a single denunciation of 
Mr. Jackson by Mr. Tilak was produced. The confes- 
sion of a wretched boy caught after the crime was not 
the best evidence of the truth of the matters concerned. 
Regarding the remaining four libels, not a scrap of evi- 
dence had been given in the case. In conclusion he 
said that no matters of colour or race or creed or reli- 
gion should come in the way and that the Jury should 
give Mr. Tilak unfailing justice even if the heavens 
should fall. Mr. Justice Darling then summed up the 



TILAK — V — CHIROL 287 

case. He said that it was urged that Mr. Tilak was 
guilty only of sedition, but what was worse than sedi- 
tion but its bedfellow, high treason? How long a step was 
it from articles " seething with sedition " to the overt 
act which was necessary to constitute high treason ? 
Dealing with the murder of Mr. Rand, His Lordship 
said Mr. Tilak reminded him of the story in ^sop of 
the enemy trumpeter who begged the soldier to spare 
him on the ground that he was a non-combatant. The 
soldier refused on the ground that without the trum- 
peter's summons the enemy soldiers would not have 
advanced. Turning to the case of Mr. Jackson His 
Lordship said that it was true that he (Mr. Tilak) had 
not singled out Mr. Jackson as he had singled out 
Mr. Rand for denunciation, but it was enough that he 
had created the atmosphere for the crime by stirring up 
hatred of officials generally. Was it unjust to say that 
he was the real author of the crime just as Fagin was 
the real author of the crimes committed by his pupils ? 
Concluding His Lordship said that he did not think 
that he had ever tried a more serious case having re- 
gard to its possible public consequences. He would 
not submit the alleged libel to the Jury in snippets but 
as a whole, as it has been pleaded. If they found that 
in any part of it, the defendants had failed to make 
good their plea of justification, they could find for the 
plaintiff and award damages accordingly. 

The Jury retired at 5-50P.M. (February 21st 1919, the 
eleventh day of the proceedings) and after a deUbera- 
tion of 25 minutes returned a verdict for the defendants. 
Judgment was entered accordingly with costs. 

As one distinguished writer said ** No Indian in Bri- 



288 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

tain was more surprised at the verdict of the jury thatt 
Mr. Tilak himself !" With his inborn faith in British 
Justice and in the truth and righteousness of his cause, 
he had hoped — a hope supported by the best legal 
advice available — to prove to the British Democracy 
how the lofty, lawabiding patriotism of the Nationalist 
Party had been grossly perverted to mean an illicit and 
unholy alUance with the terrorist and the anarchist. 
Standing on the crest of this victory he had hoped to- 
explain to the British Democracy the tenets of the ad- 
vanced political party in India. All these hopes were 
dashed to the ground. It was not for nothing that Sir 
Valentine had declared through his Counsel that he 
** could have avoided the whole of this litigation by an 
apology and by a subscription to the Indian Wax 
ReUef Fund, but, in the interests of the Empire he felt 
that, to make an apology under the circumstances of 
this case or to withdraw or retract what he had deli- 
berately stated and published would have been a dis- 
aster of the very gravest kind as regards the Govern- 
ment of India/' The Morning Post, might ridicule Mr. 
Tilak for his " singular lack of humour " in setting out 
to prove " the t3Tanny of a nation by pursuing one 
of its own members through its own courts." Mr. 
Tilak *s opponents have stigmatised this as " incon- 
ceivable folly " and even some of his friends have 
called it a * blunder *. It is easy to be wise after 
the event. Mr. Tilak never required his character to 
be " whitewashed " so far as Indians were concerned. 
It was to cure the British Democracy of the " slow 
and persistent poison " which had been at work 
against his political party, that he dared mortgage all 



fILAK— V — CHIROL 289 

his estate and in the evening of his life, with tremen- 
dous odds manifestly against him, fight with an op- 
ponent basking in the sunshine of the Imperial Govern- 
ment. Even this * blunder ' was creditable to him, in 
that it showed his unflinching faith in the British Jus- 
tice ; and it is doubtful whether the victory of Sir 
Valentine Chirol has really helped the Government 
when this victory has been followed by the loss of faith 
in British Justice, in the minds of thousands and thou- 
sands of Indians, whose confidence in the truth and 
justice of Mr. Tilak's cause was instinctive. When the 
greatest Indian of the century was described before the 
highest Judicial Tribunal of the Empire as one whose 
reputation was not worth the smallest coin in existence, 
when every kind of abusive epithet was hurled at his 
devoted head with a levity truly disgusting, need we 
wonder if people commenced to beHeve that even Bri- 
tish Justice is capricious and uncertain ? Mr. Tilak's 
financial embarrassments — amounting to nearly three 
lakhs of rupees — were, within a few weeks removed by 
the love and loyalty of his friends and followers, but the 
rude shock which India's faith in the "British Justice*' 
has received, does not angur well for the future.

## RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION 

Not what thou and I have promised to each other but what 
the balance of our forces can make us perform to each other : 
that, in so sinful a world as ours, is the thing to be counted 
apon. 

Thomas Carlyle. 

\\fJIEN Mr. Montague asked Mr. Tilak v^^hat he would 
do in case the reforms fell short of his expect- 
ations, Mr. Tilak readily replied "I would accept what is 
given and fight for more." Being a strategist and not 
a mere idealist, Mr. Tilak knew full well how to make 
use of the smallest concessions. That is why, when 
the Montague-Chelmsford report was out,he did not run 
into hysterics over it. He never called for its unquali- 
fied rejection. From the very beginning his criticism 
was strong but constructive and he refused to lend the 
weight of his support to that small party in the Congress 
which in July and August, 19 18, talked of a summary 
refusal of the 'little' Mont-ford gift. It was not, there- 
fore, likely, that Mr. Tilak would, in November 1919 
reject those Reforms which nearly two years back he 
had decided to accept for a time. When he returned 
to India in November 1919 after advocating the Congress 
demands before the British Democracy, he had already 
matured in his mind a plan of operations, which he 
thought, would be the shortest cut to Home Rule. 
When in England, Mr. Tilak had been deeply impres 



LOKAMANYA TILAK ' 29X 

-sed with the completeness with which Sinn Feiners had 
carried the General Election of 19 18. The Sinn Fein- 
ers* refusal to take their seats in the Parliament, their 
efforts to organize a Government of their own, strongly 
appealed to him. Of course, he saw the limitations 
under which they were working and the difference bet- 
ween the conditions in Ireland and those in India. An 
adoption of the peaceful portions of the tactics of the 
Sinn Feiners, in the more favourable circumstances of 
India, with her large size, her distance from England 
and her countless millions, would, he was convinced 
bring greater pressure on our rulers, and compel them, 
in spite of their hesitation and caution, to revise the 
Government of India Act in the shortest time possible. 
Mr. Tilak had no mind to allow things to drift or leave 
them for an uncertain futurity to decide. '* Now and 
here '* the question must be satisfactorily and finally 
solved. No tinkering, no tardy instalments, no humili- 
ating examinations could be tolerated. 
t'j'The immediate task before him, on his return from 
London, was, so to organise public opinion as to give a 
definite verdict on the Government of India Act. 
There was barely one month. He consulted his friends 
and associates in other parts of India. Very Uttle dan- 
ger of opposition was anticipated. The Uttle content- 
ment or rejoicing that existed was to be found only in 
the Moderate circles. The redoubtable Mrs. Besant 
was, of course, expected to put up a strong fight ; but 
she was working hopelessly against the tremendous 
force of the national sentiment and was bound to be 
worsted in the fray. Soon after the passing of the 
Government of India Act, was issued the Royal Procla- 



292 ' • RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION " 

ndation, so singularly noble in sentiment, so eloquent ii* 
style. It was calculated to rouse the imagination and 
evoke the gratitude of India. No doubt, Mr. Montague 
meant well by India and his appeal had the ring of sin-^ 
cerity. But the days of miracles are gone and Mr. 
Tilak knew full well that the magic wand of the Royal^ 
Proclamation would not, all of a sudden, transform the 
mentality of the governing class of India. He, there- 
fore, publicly expressed his gratitude for the Royat 
message and promised responsive co-operation. 

On the saintly and chivalrous mind of Mahatma 
Gandhi, the Royal Proclamation had a far different 
effect. He believed the message to be a distinct depar- 
ture from the narrow lines of policy hitherto laid down 
and calculated to usher a new era in the national life 
of India. He. therefore, wanted to welcome the mes- 
sage without any reservations. He was strongly sup- 
ported by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Pandit 
Motilal Nehru. 

At Amritsar, where the Congress met, a triangular 
fight was expected. There was enough courage or 
enthusiasm at the meeting. The question that occured 
to a thoughtful mind was " Would there be the neces- 
sary amount of tact, shrewdness and foresight which the 
occassion demanded ?" Mr. Gandhi's presence and 
arguments infused moral sublimity into the proceedings 
as was seen by the Resolution which condemned the 
excesses (April 19 19) of the infuriated mobs in the 
Punjab and other places. The question was whether 
the Congress would rise to the same height of statesman- 
ship as it did to that of moral sublimity. What should 
be the wording of the resolution about the Reforms ? 



LOKAMANYA TILAK i 293 

Mrs. Besant's proposal, had it been passed, would have 
emphasized our expression of gratitude at the expense 
of our dignity. Mr. Gandhi's resolution was graceful 
without being emphatically dignified. Mr. Tilak's re- 
solution was a unique combination of grace with dignity, 
mellowed by a reasonable expression of gratitude. It 
was not a question merely of grace or gratitude. The 
Resolution, Mr. Tilak said, ought not to tie our hands. 
We must emphatically state that we are fit for an im- 
mediate establishment of Home Rule. We must em- 
phatically state that we are not satisfied with what has 
been given. We must fully reserve our right to carry 
on a vigorous agitation for a very early revision of the 
Government of India Act. We must carry on our propa- 
ganda in other parts of the world and convince the 
different nations of the legitimacy of our demands. 
If the Resolution is too complimentary, if it talks too 
much of gratitude and satisfaction, how shall we, say 
next year, appeal to the British Democracy, to revise 
the Act ? This, in brief, was Mr. Tilak's reasoning. 
In the draft Resolution " Mr. Das reiterated the de- 
mands of the Delhi Congress and declared that the 
Reforms Act is inadequate, unsatifactory and disappoint- 
ing. Mr, Gandhi's argument was that those who label- 
led the Reforms Act as disappointing could not be 
expected to use the same for the early estabhshment of 
Responsible Government in India. Disappointment 
and work could not go hand in hand. He appealed to 
Mr. Tilak, the commentator of the Gita, to solve the 
riddle and have no mental reservations towards those 
in England who were well-disposed towards India. 
Mr. Tilak repHed that disappointment should not be 



294 *' RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *' 

the reason for keeping oneself aloof from or boycotting the 
Reforms Act ; nay, the Gita enjoins us to accept the 
hievitable and work under distressing circumstances 
with a clear sense of duty. After a lively discussion 
lasting for nearly five hours in the open sessions, Messrs. 
Gandhi, Das, Tilak, Pal, Malaviya come to a compro- 
mise " and the Resolution concluded declaring that 
India should work the Govermnet of India Act so as to 
secure the early estabUshment of full responsible govern- 
ment. 

In supporting the Resolution, Mr. Tilak made an ex- 
cellent speech. He concluded it in the following signi- 
ficant and statesmanlike words : — 

" We want now clearly to declare, not only here but 
to the whole world that we are not satisfied with the 
Act. We want to continue our agitation. We want 
to utilize it to our best advantage and continue to de- 
mand more and we want the rest of the world to know 
that this is the exact state of things. Do not mislead 
the civilized nations of Europe. Take care of that. 
Do not be too generous, too humane to accept with 
fulsome glee what little has been thrown to you now." 

The fierce controversies at the Amritsar Congress 
threw Mrs. Besant into an unnatural alliance with the 
Moderates ; and the next few months are thick with con- 
troversial dust. It is really painful to see the great lady 
trying to harp on the innocent statement of Mr. Tilak 
" Diplomacy must be met with diplomacy." Mrs. 
Besant complained of being used as a tool by Mr. Tilak, 
called him a menance to India and reported him as 
having said to a prominent member of the Moderate 
Party " I deliberately misrepresent the Moderates; that ia 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 295 

Politics." All this was probably the result of her dis- 
appointment and discomfiture at Delhi (1918) and at 
Amritsar (1919). Her conduct in England was severely 
criticised by Messrs. Khaparde and Patel and her at- 
tempts to persuade Labour leaders not to move Con- 
gress amendments were brought to light. This exaspe- 
rated her beyond all measure and she appealed to the All- 
India Congress Committee to disassociate itself from the 
utterances of Messrs. Patel and Khaparde. This appeal 
was made when Mr. Patel had already sailed for 
England. So Mr. Tilak had to take the sword in his 
behalf and do an unpleasant duty. It is well to cast 
a veil over all these controversies; for nothing pained Mr. 
Tilak more than the attitude of Mrs. Besant, who, he 
always held, was by temperament never a moderate. 
He had publicly appealed to her (March 1920), iu the 
best interests of the country to co-operate with the 
Congress Party. But God had willed it that her path 
should differ from that of the Congress leaders. 

The Moderate Party, with its age-long opposition to 
Mr. Tilak's principles and personality was led in Maha- 
rashtra by the Hon'ble Mr. Paranjpye, who, with true 
iconoclastic fervour, started his new campaign against 
the Nationalists by striking at their idol. When, there- 
fore, an address was proposed to be given at Poona to 
Mr. Tilak on his return from England (November 1919), 
Mr. Paranjpye opposed it by publishing " a catalogue 
of Mr. Tilak's sins of commission and omission." The 
attack failed ; the address was duly given and though 
Mr. Parajpye was challenged to personally lead the op- 
position at the pubUc meeting, he wavered at the last 
moment and remained absent. 



296 " RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION 



>» 



The Moderates realized, though a little late that oppo 
sition to an address to Mr. Tilak would bring both defeat 
and bad repute ; their chivalry and decency would be 
questioned. But the sentimental cry of simulta- 
neous compulsory education to the boys and girls of 
Poona was catching. It did not matter that the tax- 
able capacity of the Poona City Municipality did not 
allow an additional annual burden of Rs. 86,500. It did 
not matter that even in Western countries, when on 
economical grounds a choice had to be made, the com- 
pulsory education of boys usually preceded that of the 
girls. It did not even matter that Mr. Gokhale, the 
great apostle of moderation wanted to give free and 
compulsory education to boys first and to girls after- 
wards. The Moderates simply wanted to enjoy a little 
fun at the expense of the Nationalists who were in a 
majority in the City Municipality. The law demand- 
ed that the opposition must not exceed one- third of the 
total number of members. Taking advantage of this 
provision, the Moderates, " in defiance of precedence, 
prudence, practical wisdom and financial knowledge " 
of their own city were willing to see the education of a 
large number of boys neglected, because their oppo- 
nents, the Nationalists could not guarantee the immediate 
education of all the girls in the city on account of 
financial difficulties. 

The Moderates' concern for the free and compulsory 
education of girls at Poona was equalled by their keen 
desire for the free and unrestricted admission of peasant 
delegates to the Poona District Conference held at 
Junnar early in March (1920). Knowing that they 
would be in a minority at the Conference, the Moderates, 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 297 

who at their Conferences held at Bombay and Calcutta, 
had never thought of this concession, began to harp on 
this favourite string. Without even a week's notice to 
the Reception Committee, they wanted to have a num- 
ber of " Peasant Delegates ", secretly pledged to vote 
for them. But the Committee allowed only five " Pea- 
sant Delegates " to each Taluka. The result is curious. 
Not even five peasant delegates repsonded to the call 
and the Conference was a signal triumph of Mr. Tilak 
and his party. 

Through the thick clouds of all these controversies, 
Mr. Tilak was hacking his path to the goal. An old 
acquaintance of the unrepentent Indian bureaucracy, 
he cleariy knew, what even a less experienced man has 
observed that we " are dealing with the most astute and 
diplomatic and clever set of politicians in the worid and 
that they could undo what the Secretary of State has 
done." He had noted how tardily the Bureaucracy had 
responded to the gracious Royal Proclamtion and how 
incomplete was the amnesty to political prisoners. He 
had also noted how the Congress party was rigorously 
excluded from the Advisory Committee on Rules under 
the Government of India Act. But the position he had 
taken from the beginning was one of responsive co-ope- 
ration and he was not required to change it. In a 
speech at Bombay he said : — 

'* We are prepared to co-operate ; but if there is 
nothing to co-operate, we shall not. * * His 
Majesty has asked the people and the authorities 
to co-operate with each other. * * * * It is 
almost a scandal to say that Indians are not pre- 
pared to co-operate for the sake of India ; obey- 



298 "responsive co-operation" 

ing His Majesty means in India loyalty to bureau- 
cracy first and to people afterwards. * * Let 
the authorities declare in what ways they are 
prepared to co-operate with us and we can 
assure them that, if they co-operate with us, we 
can, with them. Co-operation is mutual 



»» 



Meanwhile, events of far greater import than party 
squabbles or recriminations were happening with shock- 
ing rapidity. The imposition of an unjust, inequitable, 
humiliating and crushing peace on Turkey, in defiance 
of repeated pledges, in defiance of the feeUngs of Indian 
Moslems set aflame the Islamic mind in this country. 
The recklessness with which the sacredness of pledges 
was disregarded produced the deepest impression on the 
mind of Mahatma Gandhi and his moral nature revolted 
against an order of things which rendered possible such 
brutal callousness. The Privy Council Judgment in 
the Am ri tsar case dealt " a severe blow to our constitu- 
tional rights, investing the Viceroy with almost auto- 
cratic power of ordinance-making." It showed how 
** the judgments even of the highest tribunals are not 
unaffected by political considerations." The belated 
publication of the belated report of the belated Hunter 
Commission aggravated the situation by showing how 
the majority of the Commissioners considered cold- 
blooded murders to be mere " grave errors " and 
** unfortunate " or " injudicious " acts. The Viceroy 
condoning the sins of the notorious Satrap of the 
Punjab, the Secretary of State applauding Lord 
Chelmsford, the House of Lords in love with 
General Dyer, — all this was too much even for the most 



LOKAMANVA TILAK 299 

forgiving of all morteils ! As gentle as a lamb, as for- 
giving as an angel, Mahatma Gandhi could not yet 
endure the flagrant injustice of the Simla autocrats ; 
and he determined to unsheathe the sword of non-co- 
opera ton with the ultimate object of bringing round 
the up-holders of this unrighteous poUcy. 

Mr. TUak cordially welcomed the rise of this luminary 
in the firmament of Indian Pohtics ; and as regards 
non-co-operation, Mr. Tilak was a non-co-operator since 
the very beginning of his career. He had set his 
back on Government service and had not cared to prac- 
tise as a pleader in the Government courts ; he had 
given eleven years of his life to the attempt of nation- 
alizing education and had left the Deccan Education 
Society when he found his task impossible. So far, 
therefore, as the first stage of Mahatma Gandhi's pro- 
gramme went, Mr. Tilak had put into practice most of 
the items included therein. As regards the remaining 
three stages, Mr. Tilak would never have shirked advo- 
cating them had he found it necessary in the circumstan- 
ces of the country. There was only one item to which 
he was strongly opposed, and that was the boycott of 
the Councils. This he considered suicidal. He could 
not be suspected of being specially enamoured of the 
Councils as most of the prestige which he commanded 
was due, not to his short membership of the Bombay 
Legislative Council but to his work outside the Council. 
Besides, owing to age and loss of vigour he had almost 
decided not to stand for election. He was however em- 
phatically of opinion that in the agitation to be started 
for a very early revision of the Government of India Act, 
it was necessary to capture most of the seats in the Coun- 



300 " RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION " 

cils. He differed from Mahatma Gandhi's opinion that 
the Councils are a snare and that there is an insidious 
poison which invariably affects its members. Mr. Tilak 
admitted that this was true when we were in a substan- 
tial minority in the Councils but he held that no danger 
need be anticipated when the Nationahsts would enter 
the Councils not necessarily to co-operate. The most 
aggressive and effective form of non-co-operation would 
be non-co-operation within the Councils and on this he 
had set his heart. 

That is why at the Sholapur Provincial Conference 
(April 2nd, 3rd and 4th), he laboured to carry a resolu- 
tion which called upon the Congress Committees in par- 
ticular and the public in general to *' accept the lead 
given by the Amritsar Congress, in the matter of the 
working of the Reforms Act, and support, at the ensuing 
Council elections, the candidature of persons whose 
allegiance to the Congress is beyond all question.'' The 
bewitching cry of " elect the best men " was raised by 
the minority. Mr. Tilak agreed ; but explained that 
the men to be elected must be best for the purpose in 
view, namely the working of the Reforms Act so as to 
attain full Responsible Government within the shortest 
time possible. He was in no sympathy with best men 
who would merely like to work the act without this 
particular end in view. If we really went in for best 
men, why, in the bureaucratic fold, many capable per- 
sons might be found; but the}' were not wanted, nor tha 
Moderates, if they did not respect the Amritsar Resolu- 
tion. This was too much for the Moderates, who had 
tried their best to attend the Conference in large num- 
bers, though in trying to secure numbers, they had to 



LOKAMANYA tiLAK 30 r 

leave aside principles and get elected through " the 
Deccan Sabha of Poona, hundreds of men of Sholapur, 
as Poona Delegates including known minors, and people 
of doubtful credentials and suspicious characters." 
Mrs. Besant had come all the way from Madras to get 
the Amritsar judgment reversed ; she moved an amend- 
ment which would have enabled the Moderates to stand 
for election in the name of the Congress and through 
the help of the Congress ogencies. But the amend- 
ment was defeated by an over- whelming majority. 

Within a fortnight after the close of the Sholapur 
Conference, Mr. Tilak published the manifesto of the 
" Congress Democratic Party." Though he published 
this document over his signature, still he had consulted 
most of the Nationalist leaders in Western India, and 
it was merely to save valuable time that he thought it 
desirable to publish it on his individual responsibility. 
Those who know that Mr. Tilak wanted to place the 
manifesto for approval before the Special Congress at 
Calcutta, will not blame him for having acted autocra- 
tically in the name of the Congress Democratic Party. 
The Manifesto is a comprehensive document, by no 
means exhaustive ; it lays down the general policy of the 
advanced poUtical party. The Manifesto declares : — 
" This Party proposes to work the Montague Re- 
forms Act for all it is worth, and for accelerating 
the grant of full Responsible Government ; 
and for this purpose it will, without hesitation, 
offer co-operation or resort to constitutional op- 
position, whichever may be expedient and best 
calculated to give effect to the popular will.'' 
What was the object of issuing this Manifesto ? Some 



302 RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *' 

unfriendly critics think that Mr. Tilak was pressed — 
nobody knows, by whom — to declare his programme 
and was required to show some constructive work as his 
name was associated with mere destruction. Others 
hold that it was a set off against Mahatma Gandhi's 
programme of Non-co-operation published about this 
time. There are persons who seek to justify Mr. Tilak's 
Manifesto by pointing out that the publication of the 
Congress Democratic Party's Manifesto was followed by 
the publication of at least half a dozen similar docu- 
ments from different groups of politicians in India. 
The truth is that the manifesto of Mr. Tilak forms only 
a link in the work of organisation required for carrying 
the Councils elections, on which Mr. Tilak had set his 
heart. The first step was, of course, the Amritsar Re- 
solution. The Sholapur Conference which followed, 
developed the Amritsar Resolution, and specified the 
persons eligible for election under the Congress banner. 
The Manifesto followed, pointing out at length, the 
scope of the work of the Congress Party. The fourth 
step was taken when at the Annual Conference of the 
Indian Home Rule League, the services of the League 
were placed at the disposal of persons belonging to the 
Congress Democratic Party and desirous of standing as 
candidates for Councils. Mr. Tilak's next idea was to get 
the Congress Democratic Party's Manifesto approved of 
by the Special Session of the Congress at Calcutta. 
He intended to make this Congress concentrate upon 
the elections in November 1920 ; and then, after having 
established an over- whelming majority in the Councils, 
he intended at Nagpur to give an ultimatum to the 
Bureaucracy. Had the Bureaucracy failed to respond^ 



LOKAMANYA HLAK 3O3 

the Nationalists' majority would have absented itself 
from the councils or taken to other forms of opposition 
which would have brought the Bureaucracy to their 

knees. 

It should be noted that this programme was not at all 
inconsistent with the acceptance of Mahatma Gandhi's. 
Indeed, it seems certain that both the Mahatma and the 
Lokamanya would have fused their programmes into 
one. Had Mr. Tilak lived, the whole of Mr. Gandhi's 
programme and not merely its first step, would, very 
probably, have been accepted by the Calcutta Congress, 
with the proviso, that the Councils were not to be boy- 
cotted. The Nation would thus have been able to wage 
a battle royal with the Bureaucracy — ^within and out- 
side the councils, the one helping the progress of the 
other ; and the sad spectacle of the Bureaucracy trying 
to crush the Non-co-operators with the aid of the Mode- 
rates in the Councils, would never have been seen. 
Had repression come, it would have appeared hideous 
in all its nakedness. 



## THE END 



Mr. Tilak is dead ! Long live Mr. Tilak ! 

The Tribune. 

npHE situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the 
middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public 
man has occupied in India. He was the most success- 
ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing 
workers who started the New English School (1880), 
the Kesari and the MahraUa (1881). His opponents — 
Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered 
to their fathers before the substantial achievement of 
their labours. He alone represented, not merely the 
youngest but the oldest generation living. Starting 
his life as an ' opponent of Social Reform ' he lived to 
count the staunchest reformers among his lieutenants. 
The branded ' enemy of the Mahomedans ' was the 
ambassador of Hindu-Moslem unity at Lucknow and 
his active co-operation was sought by and promised to 
the leaders of the Khilafat movement. The slogan of 
Swaraj, issuing from his pen in 1895 was echoed by the 
National Congress of 1906 and the Government of India 
Act of 1919. His no-rent campaign of 1896 forms one 
of the planks of the Non-co-operation programme. 
* The wrecker of the Congress' was its greatest bulwark 
and chosen President. Dreaded by the Government, 
hated by Anglo-Indians, feared by the Moderates, he was 



THE END 305 

the idol of the country, the Uving embodiment of all 
its aspirations. Behind him lay the memories of an 
uneven and almost single-handed struggle extending 
over forty years. Ahead, there was a struggle still, 
but a struggle where victory was certain, and the sinews 
of war quite abundant. He was not only the Moses 
but the Joshua of the Promised Land. He had won his 
Austerlitz at Amritsar, and the future struggle, grim 
as it promised to be, was in a sense far easier than 
the one in which he was engaged ever since his entry 
into the public life. 

But, — alas ! the end was approaching. Ever since 
his return from Amritsar, a sense of inexplicable fatigue 
frequently haunted him. He would occasionally talk 
of retiring from active hfe. PoUtics meant strain, phy- 
sical and mental and he did not feel himself up to it. 
This was surely the whispering of Death. 

After his sickly boyhood, Mr. Tilak enjoyed many 
years of exuberant health and energy. Rarely, if 
ever, he was HI. His digestion was exceptionally 
nice. He had the glut of a giant for thought or action. 
His powers of endurance were wonderful. His sleep 
was short and sound and very often he could dispense 
with it altogether. After a busy day, he usually read 
far into the night and was up at the usual time. His 
reading, deep and varied, lasting at a stretch for hours 
together, was never known to weary him. 

With the incarceration of 1897, there came a change. 
He lost enormously in weight. His health was pulled 
down ; his digestion was enfeebled. After his release 
he spent a few months at Sinhgad in rest and in the 
improvement of his health. To a certain extent it 
20 



306 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

did improve. But he never fully recovered from the 
blow. 

Then came diabetes, the companion of the English- 
educated in India. Evidently it was the gift of the 
Yeravda jail and it cast sUght shadows of old age on 
his person. 

For the last fifteen years of his life, this fell disease 
was his companion. Bravely did Mr. Tilak fight with 
it and so far was he successful that the disease did not 
torment him with all its virulence. It was, however, 
stni there, working insidiously, and slowly and silently 
sapping his strength ! He held the fell disease in his 
^p ; the disease too, did not loosen its hold. 

Having studied all the existing medical Uterature on 
the subject, he fixed a regimen for himself to which he 
adhered with military rigour. When it was hot, he 
usually lived at Sinhgad. Periods of hard work were 
carefully followed by rest. When he rested, he kept 
no books, he read no papers. He left instructions at 
Poona regarding the disposal of correspondence. Only 
the most important matters — private or public — whose 
execution could not be delayed and particularly those 
which required his instructions, were reported to him. His 
morning walk, occasionally in the company of some 
obscure villager, lasted for three or four hours and 
was followed by an hour's plunge. This completed 
the day's exercise. 

His capacity to withdraw his mind from work, stood 

him in good stead. Always optimistic, he never allowed 

worries, small or great, to trouble him. His self-control 

was wonderful and helped him considerably in improv- 

ng his health. Storm after storm swept past him. 



THE END 307 

leaving him, calm and self-possessed. His private 
life, lived in the full blaze of publicity, was a tower of 
strength to him ;for virtue is the greatest tonic. 

Call it the peace of a philosopher, the faith of the 
hero, the light-heartedness of a child or the recklessness 
of a soldier, his mental equanimity was the secret of 
his health. The dread uncertainties of our pubUc hie 
explain to a great extent why many a public worker 
dies young. To work with despair and defeat writ 
large on the wall is, indeed, a trial ; and to this trial 
our spirited workers are being put these many years. 
The longevity of a Dr. Bahandarkar, may not cause 
wonder ; but the comparative longevity, which Mr. 
Tilak reached, surprises those who consider his mental 
sufferings, his extraordinary brain-work and the 
vicissitudes of his life. 

Chiplonker died in 1882, Apte in 1892, Agarkar, 
Kelkar, and Namjoshi in 1895, all in the prime of hfe. 
At one time Mr. Tilak thought that he too, would be sum- 
moned away early. Providence, however, had reserved 
for him a longer career, to be written in letters of gold ; 
and yet could he not have been spared a httle more ? 

The organization of the Congress Democratic Party, 
the welding of Mr. Gandhi's programme with his own. 
an ultimatiun to the Bureaucracy, a vigorous foreign 
propaganda, these were the thoughts that occupied his 
waking and sleeping hours in the last month ( July 
1920) of his Hfe. In the course of this month, he had 
severe attacks of malaria. However, he completely re- 
covered, went to Bombay for his last fight in the Tai 
Maharaj case, triumphed over his enemies and had 
begun to think of recuperating his strength when 



308 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

an evening motor-drive brought him a chill whicS 
soon developed into high fever. None, however, sus- 
pected the worst and congratulatory anniversary meet- 
i ngs were held (23rd July) in Bombay and elsewhere. 
The fever, brought by the chill, subsided only to rec- 
tum soon. From Monday night (26th July), " his- 
fever took a decidedly serious turn and it was found 
that the base of his right lung was affected and the 
fever developed signs of pneumonia. The whole of 
Tuesday was a day of anxiety. There was no brain- 
complication and his consciousness was unimpaired.*' 
Still the situation was critical and his friends and rela- 
tives gathered to wait upon him. He chaffed his son 
upon having run up to Bombay on this flimsy pretence 
and his daughters upon being rather too fond of their 
parents' home. He disdained to leave any initructions 
regarding his affairs, though pressed to do so. "I 
am not going to die, these five years," he said " be sure 
of that." Wednesday morning, the temperature was 
normal and the pulse regular. This was a happy sign. 
But in the afternoon " again he got fever and again his 
heart began to show signs of weakness. He lost all 
consciousness and became delirious. He continued 
more or less in the same state during the whole of 
Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, there was 
a complication of the stomach which began to be dis- 
tended. With great difficulty, the doctors led him out 
of the crisis. On Thursday at about 5 p.m., he had an 
attack of angina pectoris which threatened to be serious 
and fatal but, thanks to the timely efforts of the doctors, 
he was pulled out of it. He had similar attacks, three 
times afterwards, but they were weak in intensity. On 



THE END 309 

Friday and the whole of Saturday, he continued in the 
same unconscious state of mind with uncertain and 
irregular pulse and a weak heart. Suddenly at 10-30 
P.M., his heart began to show signs of exhaustion and 
his breathing became hard, and at last at 12-50 a.m., 
August 1st, 1920, the cruel hand of Death snatched him 
away." 

Anxious messages, distinguished callers, large, un- 
manageable crowds testified to the love and devotion 
he inspired. During the sad week, the hearts of all 
Indians, alternating with hopes and fears, must have 
gone up to the Almighty in silent or vocal prayer. But 
the hopes were dashed to the ground and the worst 
fears proved true, when on August ist, the news of his 
demise was flashed all over the country ! 

What a pity that he left us no parting message 1 
True, his whole life was one long message, a source of 
inspiration to all. When his feeble body was struggling 
v/ith his departing soul, even then, he thought, not of 
home and family, but of his God and his country. In 
the earher stages of his unconsciousness, when a copy 
of the Gita was shown to him, he uttered his favourite 
verses : — 

" Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails I come 
down to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to 
establish Dharma." {Gita, Chapter 4, Verses y &S). 

These memorable words of Lord Krishna, uttered by 



310 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Mr. Tilak in his unconscious state, reveal the back- 
^ound of his mind. He braved the terrors of gaol-Ufe, 
he could Uve down all obloquy, persecution and misre- 
presentation on the strength of this Faith. All the 
political battles fought by him were not waged for any 
earthly reward but from a high sense of duty, based on 
an unshakable faith that God was working through him. 
During all the storms of his life, he never felt weak or 
pessimistic because he knew that he was a mere pawn 
employed by that Divinity which presided over the 
destinies of India. A Tilak may come and go ; but His 
work would never wait ; and when the ground is suffi- 
ciently prepared. He shall come down to estabhsh the 
reign of Peace and Goodness. 

Mr. Tilak's scattered and subdued utterances in deli- 
rium bespeak his love of the country. He frequently^ 
referred to the Calcutta Congress and asked " Has the 
Special been arranged ?" *' Have you wired to Mr. 
Pat el ?" Then there was the Punjab wrong to which 
he occasionally referred. Sometimes, he would get 
excited and talk wildly. In an outburst of passion he 
cmce said " 500 rupees to the editor; plus motor- 
aUowance ! What will these lord-lings do for the 
country ?" On the 28th, he frequently talked of 1818 
" 1818 — 1918 — one hundred years — what a Ufe of servi- 
tude !" The last important words, reported to have 
been uttered by him on July 29th at i p.m., were " unless. 
Swaraj is achieved, — India shall not prosper. It is 
required for our very existence !" 

The funeral of the Lokamanya was as memorable as 
his life. It has been thus graphically described by a 
contemporary : — 



THE END 3H 

" It was one o'clock at midnight. All round was peace 
and calmness. There was a little drizzle of rain and 
men, not knowing the disaster that was to overtake 
them on the morning of the next day, were having a 
sound and sweet sleep. But the mysterious power, 
'which rules the world was wide awake, and stealing a 
march on the subconscious man, carried away one of 
the most honoured, respected and beloved of the 
people- . . . .(When morning broke, people found that) 
the vigilant watchman of India's cause had disappeared 
from their midst. . . . The news of his death gave a 
shock to the people, it stunned them, they looked at 
each other with blank eyes and they knew not what 
to do. 

" Never before in the history of Bombay, was such a 
scene of universal grief witnessed. People had begun 
to flock near Sirdar Griha from 7 in the morning and by 
8a.m., there was no room for anybody to go up to catch 
his last sight. The labourer had left the miU, the Mar- 
wari his account-book, the Bania his purse and every 
man and woman was out to see the last of their be- 
loved leader. Musalmans, Parsees, Christians deserted 
their homes to pay their respects to a man, who had 
sacrificed his all at the altar of the country and suffered 
heavily for bravely defending her cause. In his life- 
time, Mr. Tilak was the recipient of many popular de- 
monstrations of good-will but the triumphal march of 
of dead Tilak through the streets on August ist, 1920 
was more magnificent than any during his life-time. 

" The body of Lokamanya Tilak was brought out and 
put on the balcony so that it could be witnessed by the 
eager and expectant crowds. The crowd increased at 



312 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

every moment and it grew so tremendous that although 
the funeral procession was timed to start at i p.m., it 
could not be started till 2 p.m. The procession was 
about a mile and a half and at a very conservative 
estimate, about two lakhs of men took part in it. 

*' In the funeral procession were seen Mr. Gandhi, 
Mr. Shaukat Ah, Dr. Kitchlew, Mr. Jamnadas, Mr. 
Banker, and many other prominent citizens of Bombay. 
Two special trains from Poona brought a number of 
Mr. Tilak's friends and devoted followers. They claim- 
ed that Mr. Tilak's body should be cremated at Poona. 
The people of Bombay insisted on getting the honour to 
themselves and in the end they won and cremated him, 
by special arrangements, on the sands of the Back Bay. 
His body was seated in a palanquin and the pall-bearers 
included Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Shaukat Ali, Dr. Kitchlew 
and many others. On the route, the procession had to 
stop at innumerable places, because a number of people 
came out to offer flowers. At every step, most enthu- 
siastic ovations were received. 

" The body was gently placed on a pyre of sandal- 
wood, so lo\dngly and liberally supplies by the Parsi 
traders ; and at sun-down, the last earthly remains of 
the Sun of Maharashtra were reduced to ashes!" 

The unexpected death of a personality of the magni- 
tude of Lokamanya Tilak united, for a time, all parties, 
and all India mourned for the eternal loss of her great 
son. Even the Anglo-Indian Press, taken as a whole, 
expressed appreciation of their life-long opponent. 
Only the Government of Bombay refused to shed tears 
with the nation ; and His Excellency Sir George Lloyd 
orfeited a precious opportunity of winning the hearts 



THE END 313 

of the people by a tactful concession to the sentiments 
of 17 non-official members of the Council, who, belong- 
ing to different political parties had united in desiring 
that the Council should be closed in honour of Mr. Tilak 
** a former member of this Council, a great Oriental 
scholar and a prominent worker in the cause of the 
country, held in high estimation by a large number of 
the people of India." But the Bureaucracy was as 
unwilling to forget its old grievances against Mr. Tilak 
as the Times of India or the Statesman. 

Thousands of memorials to the Lokamanya have 
been suggested and raised in different parts of India. 
But the grandest of them all is the one for which 
Mahatma Gandhi moved from city to city and province 
to province, collecting huge sums during the eventful 
months of April, May and June 1921. As the Mahat- 
maji has said " Truly to revere the memory of a person 
is to achieve his life's purpose. Truly to revere the 
Memory of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, whom India delighted 
and still delights to call Lokamanya must be to esta- 
blish Swaraj and thus forever perpetuate his 
memory." For this purpose, the Mahatma ji has col- 
lected the biggest fund ever raised by the people of 
India during the last hundred years. " The Tilak 
Memorial Swaraj Fund " will go down to posterity as 
a unique event in the history of this country. It will 
perpetuate not only the name of the Lokamanya but 
also that of Mahatma Gandhi, who, in three short 
months has accomplished a feat which Pandit M. M. 
Malaviya has scarcely been able to perform in the 
course of twelve years.

" May his soul rest in peace !" How poor, how un- 
real do these words strike to the ear ! The soul of the 
Lokamanya will never rest in peace unless and until Swaraj 
is established. It will be bom again and again, if need 
be, in this holy land of the rishis until its high purpose 
is accompHshed. 



## THE MAN 

The pages of thy book I read. 
And as I closed each one, 
My heart responding, ever said, 
" Servant of God I Well done I" 

Longfellow. 

T IKE his literary career, Mr. Tilak's private life was 
almost absorbed into his political existence and it 
serves but to enhance the charm of his magnetic per- 
sonality and romantic career ; and yet, considered even 
separately, that private life, lived in the full blaze of 
publicity, will serve as a model for all those who consider 
self-introspection and self-elevation as the principle 
duty of life. Charles Stuart Parnell is reported to have 
said in one of his moments of infatuation that his pub- 
lic life belonged to his country and that his private life 
was his own. Mr. Tilak made no such distinction and his 
pubUc career was only the logical outcome of those qua- 
lities of the heart, which have been over and over test- 
ed in his private life. Excepting what have been sent 
bv the cold hand of Death, no cloud has marred the 
sunshine of his domestic felicity. His wife, calm, active 
and devoted, without the least touch of the modern wo- 
man in her, made his private life perfectly happy to 
him. She bore him six children,~three sons and three 
daughters, the latter all married — and died on 6th June 
1912, while Mr. Tilak was at Mandalay. His eldest son 



THE MAN 317 

Vishwanath was cut off in the prime of his life. Sur- 
rounded by a large family of children, grand-children 
and other near relatives, trusted by numerous friends 
and followed by the majority of his countrymen, with 
his purse, long or short, always at the disposal of the 
the needy and his time all given up to reading, writing, 
thinking, working for the country, Mr. Tilak may be 
said to have passed a singularly enviable life. 

To a superficial observer, Mr. Tilak's personaUty apv- 
peared to be an extremely simple one for analysis ; but 
really it was extremely complex. "WTiat struck careful 
observers was the harmonious combination of appa- 
rently contradictory quahties. He was daring but 
cautious, simple but astute, fiery but quiet. An ex- 
tremely social man, none revelled more in solitude. 
An idealist by nature, he trained himself to a perfect 
realisation of practical limitations. Though stem, he 
was kind-hearted. He dehghted in conflicts, but he 
was by nature averse to them. He seemed resentful 
and implacable, but was always the first to conci- 
liate and compromise ; and though plain and blunt in 
his talk and dealings, he has often suffered on account 
of that refined reserve which is the highest mark of 
nobility and culture. 

Of those softer graces of fife, which are the reward 
of the pursuit of the fine arts or fashionable games, he 
was totally devoid. He never cultivated music, vocal 
or instrumental, though, of course, he encouraged it in 
the annual public festivals, instituted by him in honour 
of the god Ganesh. He suffered himself to be occasion- 
ally taken to dramas, but he considered it all to be a 
waste of time. He detested cards and was indifferent 



5l8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to chess. He never handled a bat. All these accom- 
plishments were antagonistic to his nature. We know 
how Mazzini did not consider himself to be free to indulge 
in his natural taste for music, painting and poetry ; we 
are not, therefore, surprised to find Mr. Tilak neglecting 
them. He lacked not only the time but the necessary 
inclination also. 

He rarely stood in need of physical recreation ; and 
when he wanted rest, he repaired to his favourite sana- 
torium Sinhgad and there spent three or four hours 
daily in long morning walks, in swimming and in Indian 
gymnastics. Latterly, when the strain of public work 
and the exhaustion due to diabetes worried him, he was 
required to take longer spells of rest there. 

As regards mental recreation, he had it in the diversi- 
fied pursuit of knowledge. The immense vitality of his 
brain, his powers of endurance, coupled with his in- 
terests in the various branches of learning, enabled him 
to relax hs mind by going from one subject to anothe r, 
from politics to metaphysics, thence to science or law 
or mathematics. When extremely tired, he used to 
amuse himself with his favourite book — the Maha- 
Bharat. The distractions of his political career and the 
worries of public and private persecutions which tor- 
mented him till the last, only confirmed his love of 
learning and scholarship and indeed, the happiest and 
proudest moments of his Hfe were those, when delibe- 
rately laying aside the burden of his anxieties, he flew 
to Uterature and philosophy with the eagerness that 
bespoke his preference. 

Mr. Tilak, however, was not the master of his time 
and his philosophical or political meditations were daily 



THE MAN 319 

interrupted by numerous callers, who visited him at 
any hour of the day. Many have blamed him for thus 
encouraging boredom and idle curiosity ; and to a cer- 
tain extent they were right ; for accessibihty to people 
at all times is not the necessary condition of democratic 
leadership. We know how in Greece, Pericles, the leader 
of the people was generally reserved, while his 
opponent, though the leader of the Aristocratic 
party was always accessible to the general pubUc. 
Mr. Tilak seems to have kept as his models, the Tri- 
bunes of the Roman history, and Uke them, his doors 
were open for all visitors at any time. Infant de- 
mocracy is impatient of the restraints which method 
and economy of time should impose upon the people in 
their dealings with the leaders. Mr. Tilak utilised this 
' waste of time * in gauging the view point of the public 
and in selecting and training men for his work. Be- 
sides, hke the Swami Vivekanand, he had developed 
the faculty of " thinking aloud *' and while others con- 
sidered him as merely frittering his time and energies, 
he really was building up the chains of his arguments. 

It was only in such conversations, that the real Tilak 
was seen. His writings were severely logical and the 
element of fun that was introduced therein took too 
often the form of a satirical outburst or derisive laughters 
His informal conversations, however, were full of hon 
mots and the irrepressible gaity of his nature was in 
frequent evidence. It was a delight to hear Mr. Tilak 
with his pohtical armour laid aside, talking just like 
common people and yet with a certain insight and 
grandeur which made you realise the companionship of 
a great man. It was evident that this simple mood 



320 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

would not last long but must give place to the ' politica 
gladiator/ literary giant or subtle philospher and meta- 
physician. He glided into these moods almost imper- 
ceptibly and it was some time before his hearers 
were conscious of the deep waters they were taken 
into. 

His heart was as great as head. He was a great 
giver ' and his pity gave ere charity began '. If there 
was any place where his astuteness did not work, it was 
this ; and naturally this ' weakness ' — if a weakness it 
really is — was availed of by many. He gave not for 
name but because he must ; nor was money the only 
thing he gave. For one full generation, he gave free 
legal advice to all who sought it. Rich men and poor, 
the high and the low, learned men and the illiterate—all 
have been benefitted by his legal knowledge and he 
wrote and even arranged to send the petitions of many 
of his poor countrymen. Another man in his place 
would have made a fortune upon his knowledge of law, 
but with his characteristic contempt for money, Mr. 
Tilak not only never demanded fees but actually re- 
fused them when gratefully offered ; and all this not- 
withstanding money difiiculties, which, owing to the 
Tai Maharaj case, haunted him till the last. 

It was a privilege to have Mr. Tilak as your friend ; 
for then you could sleep over your difficulties in the 
secure knowledge that your affairs would be taken care 
of. A host of instances will illustrate this point ; we 
will refer to only two. (The late) Rao Saheb Bapat, 
Settlement officer of Baroda was charged with corrup- 
tion and was tried in 1894 by a Special Commission. 
" The case arose out of a conspiracy against the Settle- 



THE MAN 321 

ment Department, which was practically headed by 
the British Political Department ; and Mr. Bapat's 
trial had certain special features of interest in as much 
as it was timed to be held behind the back of the Maha- 
raja who was then on a tour in Europe, and the revela- 
tions in the trial were expected by the enemies of the 
Maharaja to cast a damaging slur on at least one aspect 
of his administration." Mr. Tilak gave Mr. Bapat the 
better part of one year and successfully fought out his 
case. To the well-known Tai Maharaj affairs he gave 
at least eighteen years of his busy life. In the earUer 
stages of the case, there were so many occasions when 
he could have conveniently given up his interest in the 
posthmus affairs of one of his dearest friends ; but he 
was not the man to shirk off responsibility once he had 
pledged his word to his friend and he fought the case 
out to the bitter end, ultimately triumphing over his 
enemies. 

Chivalry of nature was responsible for many of 
his side-activities ; e.g. in the notorious Crawford 
case, Mr Tilak championed the cause of tlie dismissed 
Mamlatdars and succeeded in inducing the Government 
to grant them pensions when the arch-offender was 
given the same. In fact, chivalry was the bedrock 
of Mr. Tilak's character and his very entry into the 
public life of the country to the neglect of scholarly 
studies and financial prospects, is very largely due to 
this sense, which will not passively endure the sight of 
the sufferings and hardships of others. 

To his comtemporaries, Mr. Tilak appealed most as 
a courageous man — a soldier. Other aspects of his 
personality, striking as they are, only recede in the 
21 



322 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

back-ground when compared wirh his courage. Mis- 
fortunes never disheartened him. His immense optimism, 
his readiness to sacrifice, his coolness and resourceful- 
ness of mind, were but different manifestations of his 
courage. More than once, he has cheerfully left the 
sick-bed of his sons at the call of the country. The 
premature death of his eldest son gave him a shock. 
But only the nearest and most observant persons could 
mark its effect. In his last illness, after recovering 
consciousness which he had lost for over 20 hours, 
almost the first assurance he gave was " away with 
anxiety ! certainly, I am not going to die. Now I will 
still live." When arrested in 1897, he was found sleep- 
ing soundly within an hour of his arrest. In 1908, soon 
after the sentence of six years' transportation was pro- 
nounced, he could command courage and mental peace 
enough to get good sleep. In 1903 when his very 
honesty of purpose was at stake, he had serenity of 
mind not only to follow his usual avocations, but 
also to complete his Arctic Home in the Vedas. 

In his dealings with his opponents, he appeared rather 
hard and unrelenting ; who will forget the almost per- 
petual fights in which he was engaged with Gopal 
Ganesh Agarkar, the friend of his youth ? Who will 
forget the hard hits given by Agarkar, hits returned 
with interest ? But when Agarkar was on his death- 
bed, Mr. Tilak ran to his side and the last and pathetic 
reconciliation was brought about in a torrent of tears. 
Even till the last, Mr. Tilak feelingly referred to Mr. 
Agarkar, and many have seen him weep over the past 
memories. Next to Agarkar he loved Ranade and next to 
him Mr. Gokhale. Jealousy was foreign to Mr. Tilak's 



THE MAN 323 

nature, and this has been shown by his freqnent public 
appreciation of his opponents. A conspicuous instance in 
point is the address which he presented to Mr. Gokhale in 
1905, on the latter's return from England. 

This placability towards opponents is an evidence of 
a brave and candid spirit — of true Kshatriya qualities. 
In Mr. Tilak's case, these qualities were shown to ad- 
vantage by BraJimanic lustre,— simplicity, purity and the 
spirit of renunciation. His dress, diet, habits — every- 
thing was simplicity incarnate. He never allowed him- 
self to be caught in the demoralizaing snare of luxury. 
Mr. Tilak's purity of life, publicly acknowledged by men 
like Sir Valentine Chirol was the keystone of his 
character. He was virtuous not by effort but by 
instinct. 

In the earl}^ part of his career he was considered to 
be extremely obstinate, fanatical and reckless. From 
the very first his greatness was recognised by a section 
of the educated class and by the people at large who 
instinctively looked upon him as their leader. The 
tide of j.^opularity swelled more and more, till it broke 
the barriers of province, sect and creed. At the time 
of his death, Mr. Tilak was the idol of the people, the 
moulder of the national will. Honour came to him, 
in spite of his political opponents, in spite of bu- 
reaucratic persecutions. " But the cup that in- 
toxicated others, sobered him. " He kept his head 
cool, in the midst of regal honours, huge pro- 
cessions and deafening ovations. He utilised these 
outbursts for the propagation of his ideas, but he 
was, by nature averse to and impatient of such 
demonstrations. The spirit of renunciation was a 



324 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

marked feature of his character. He liked to dispense 
honours, rather than to receive them. He would be 
something higher than a king, — a king-maker. From the 
Superintendentship of the New English School and the 
Principalship of the Fergusson College to the Presiden- 
tship of the Home Rule Conference and of the National 
Congress, Mr. Tilak studiously kept himself in the 
back-ground and rejoiced in the honour of others. Time 
was, when, while in a minority in the Congress, he 
suffered his name to be proposed for the Presidentship 
of the Congress. But that was only for establishing a 
principle and not for seeking any honour ; and when 
his party did come to caommand a majority in the 
Congress, he twice refused the highest honour offered 
to him. The Special Sessions of the Congress in 1918 
and 1920 were presided over by Mr. Hasan Imam 
and Lala Lajpat Rai, and on both these occasions Mr. 
Tilak's Presidentship was unanimously sought. 

A true Brahmin and a true Kshatriya, Mr. Tilak, at 
the time of his death, was the most powerful personality 
in India. 



## IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 

Great is Journalism. Is not every Able Editor a Ruler of 
the World, being a persuader of it ; though self-elected yet 
sanctioned by the sale of his Numbers ? 

Thomas Carlyle 

~^^R. TILAK became the declared editor of" the 
"*^' Kesari on 22nd October 1887, and of the Mahratta 
on 3rd Spetember 1891. Since then, he conducted these 
journals as proprietor till the last, and though, the 
editorship was occasionally transferred to others, still 
he supplied the necessary inspiration, except during the 
intervals when he was a guest of His Majesty's gaols. 

From the very beginning, he neglected the Mahratta, 
Indeed, it may be said, he never liked journaHsm in 
Enghsh. He believed only in the vernacular as 
an instrument of national awakening. Hence he 
never cared to turn the Mahratta into a daily 
newspaper. English weeklies in India have always been 
a source of financial embarrassment to the conductors, 
and the Mahratta was no exception to this rule. At 
the time of Mr. Tilak's death, the circulation of the 
Mahratta stood at about 2000. 

With the Kesari he was in his element. A weekly paper, 
now with a circulation of over 35,000, it has moulded 
the national life of Maharashtra during the last 30 years. 
The Kesari, as the name indicates, stands for manli- 



326 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ness, strength. During all its vicissitudes, courage has 
never failed it. Its wisdom has been occasionally chal- 
lenged, its tact or fairplay. But not even the worst 
enmies have whispered cowardice to its discredit. 

During his life-time, Mr. Tilak conducted the Kesari 
nominally as a proprietory concern. In the evening of 
his life, he intended to put it on a democratic basis. 
It was only latteriy that the Kesari was a financial suc- 
cess. During the first lo years of his ownership of the 
paper, it was burdened with a heavy debt. During the 
last six years ctgain the extraordinary rise in the cost of 
paper did not make it quite a profitable concern, and in 
spite of the increase in the subscription rates, Mr. Tilak 
had to succour the paper from the profits of the Gita- 
Rahasya. Then there was the terrible expenditure of 
the long- drawn Tai Maharaj case, which had to be pro- 
vided for. In spite of all these difficulties, Mr. Tilak 
had unreservedly placed the cash-box of the Kesari at 
the entire disposal of the national propaganda. He 
spent hundreds and thousands for the national work, 
without boast or ostentation. He could have easily 
saved large amounts by substantially increasing the 
subscription, which his devoted readers would have 
gladly paid ; but he accepted the Kesari as a sacred 
trust and not as a business concern. He wanted it to 
reach the hands of the poorest of the poor and become 
the vehicle of his message. The cheapest and the best 
—it had and has no second. 

Though repeatedly pressed to turn it into a daily 
paper, Mr. Tilak till the last kept it as a we3kly and it 
was only last year that he made arrangements to bring 
it oat as a bi-weekly. The ideal he had kept before 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 32/ 

him — cheapness and excellence — was incompatible with 
the hurry and cost of a daily newspaper. 

Mr. Tilak and the Kesari were convertible terms. 
Their careers have been synonmous with the history of 
Maharashtra during the last 30 years. It has been a 
period of storm and stress. It has witnessed a vast 
transformation and has been the era of action and re- 
action — ^political and social. Through rocks and shoals, 
Mr. Tilak steered the Kc^sari, not caring for favour, nor 
afraid of frown, with a grim S3nse of duty . He was 
always bold but uniformly wary. His is one long 
record of intellectual and moral intrepidity, sustained 
by breadth of vision and depth of insight. The Kesari 
has been a castle for national fight, reared under the 
very nose of the Bureaucracy, proving impregnable even 
under shells of repression. Truly, it has become a 
national asset. 

The style of Mr. Tilak's Kesari was, like the physio- 
gnomy of its illustrious editor, plain, blunt, and aggres- 
sive. It was " reason fused and made red-hot with 
passion." It despised mere literary garnish and was the 
very negation of the soft suppleness of an intellectual 
epicurean. It had nothing of the flowing humour of Mr. 
N. C. Kelkar's style, the sweatness of Mr. Pangarkar's,* 
the grace of Mr. Agarkar's or of the subtle suggestiveness, 
dehcate irony and arrcstive coquetry of Prof- S. M. 
Paranjpye'st style. It reminds you, not of a cloister 

* Editor o£ the Mumukshu and tho author, among other 
books, of the life oE Moropant and the life of Tukaram. He is

bold articles had created (1899) quite a panic in Congress circles. 



328 [lokamanya tilak 

or an academy, not of a music-hall or a ball-room, but 
of the battle-field. Straight, pointed, Mr. Tilak's writ- 
ten words, arrow-like whistled through the air and hit 
the mark. They struck terror into the hearts of those 
who opposed him. The flunkeys, the Government 
minions and the busy nobodies were as mortally afraid 
of them as were the Reformers, the Moderates or the 
Liberals. Even the powerful Bureaucracy, protected by 
the prestige of the British Empire and the swords and 
guns of two hundred thousand soldiers, feared his at- 
tacks. Mr. Tilak has been frequently blamed for his 
strong language. We should, however, remember that 
he was the centre of acute political and social contro- 
versies extending over one generation. He could not 
be expected to rouse the masses to a sense of self-respect, 
self-reliance, and self-confidence except by pointed lan- 
guage. He, however, never hit below the belt. His 
criticism was impetuous but never vulgar, mean or 
vindictive. It bore ' no spots which all the perfumes 
of Arabia could not sweeten." 

His instructions to his assistants reveal the secret of 
his direct but homely style. " Imagine that you are 
speaking to a villager and not writing for University 
people. No Sanskrit words please. Avoid quoting sta- 
tistics. Don't scare away the reader by quoting figures. 
Keep them to yourself. Let your style be simple and 
homely. It should be as clear as day-light. The 
meaning must never be obscure." 

He was as good as his advice. True, in the early 
nineties, the Kesari was written in a more learned style. 
The exuberant scholarship of Mr. Tilak peeped through 
every column. Not a subject under the sun, but 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 329 

iound its way in the Kesari. At a minute's notice he 
poured forth columns of wonderful learning, duly 
adorned with a literary setting. Religion, philosophy, 
economics, agriculture, astronomy, science — there was 
no subject too difficult for his pen or mind. He not 
only assimilated all the available knowledge on the 
subject in hand, but put his own stamp on it. His 
luminous and often original writmgs on knotty 
questions of philosophy or science are an intellectual 
treat and would repay a careful perusal even to-day. 

But Mr. Tilak soon realised that it is not seed, lavishly 
sown that bears fruit, but the seed that is carefully put 
under the earth. This made him take into consider- 
ation the intellectual level of his readers. He put him- 
self the question " Whom do I write for ?" and it was 
got long before he gave himself the correct answer. 
uince then, his writings and speeches tended more and 
more to simplicity, without losing an iota of vigour. 

The equipment which he brought to bear on his edi- 
torial work was indeed, extremely rare, not only in 
this country but in any other. Possessed of a profound 
knowledge of the law, he did not care what restrictions the 
Government put on the freedom of the Press. He was 
prepared, he used to say, to convey his message under 
any rigours imposed by the law. Only the Bureau- 
cracy must adhere to the compact and must not shuffle 
its position again and again and try to seek new meaning 
into the definition of sedition every time, by straining 
its words and distorting their import and significance. 

His complete mastery over the Sanskrit language and 
literature, Vedic and post-Vedic, classical and philoso- 
phical, enabled him not only to form a style at once simple 



33P LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and eloquent, but to free journalistic diction from 
the unnatural pompousness — too often mistaken for 
eloquence, which the study of English classics had 
brought into Marathi. He formed a new style in 
Marathi journalism, and most of the Marathi journals 
of the day have adopted it. 

His profound knowledge of philosophy, science, 
metaphysics — Indian and European — stood him in 
good stead not only in making scholarly criticisms, but 
in the leading controversies of the last 30 years. Our 
social and religious life, ideas and institutions, are, so 
to speak, in the melting pot and the changes that are 
to be introduced must suit the basic ideas of our society. 
Mr. Tilak believed in what may be termed, " Indian 
Sociology " as Mr. Ranade did in " Indian Economics." 
His attitude towards Social Reform was largely deter- 
mined by sociological considerations. Others had seen 
only the crust that lies on the Indian civilisation 
and had pronounced it to be worthless. Mr. Tilak 
had gone deeper and had learnt how precious our 
culture is. 

He had studied the constitutional laws and histories 
of England and other European countries. Politics 
was his sp3cial study and he wanted to write an original 
thesis on this subject. At Mandalay, he devoted all his 
leisure to the study of the French and the German. 

It would thus be seen that the range of Mr. Tilak's 
reading was enormously vast. But he was not a mere 
reader of books. He meditated profoundly on what he 
read. He supplemented his reading and thinking by 
communicating with the best minds of his age. His 
active life afforded the necessary corrective to his 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 33r 

tiioaghts. The combination of a thinker and a fighter 
ia the person of its editor, gave the Kesari that amazing 
hold over its readers, which has hardly a parallel. 

Possessed of a wonderful memory, Mr. Tilak never 
cared to cultivate those methods by which many a 
newspaper writer tries to lessen the burden on his memo- 
ry. Mr. Tilak never kept notes nor topic-books. What 
he read, he remembered. What he remembered was 
alwaj^ ready at his beck and call. Quotations, extracts, 
references — everything was ready at a moment's 
notice. When he began to dictate articles for 
the Kesari, his amanuensis could, with very great 
difficulty, keep pace with him. But though Mr. Tilak 
was a rapid reader and a rapid writer, he was a very 
careful student. Before commencing to dictate, he 
carefully studied the question in all its bearing, ransack- 
ed all the available literature on the subject and then 
considered himself ready for the task. Thoroughness 
was the secret of his success. 

As the political life of the people is developing, it has 
been found necessary to supply suitable equivalents for 
English political terminology. Such v/ords as, Respon- 
sible Government, Imperial Federation, Passive Resis« 
tance, despotism. Limited Monarchy, Budget, Decentra- 
lization, do not easily lend themselves to translation. 
The brunt of the work of coining suitable Marathi 
words congenial to the genius of the language, had 
mainly fallen on Mr. Tilak, and it was very interesting 
and instructive to find this all-India leader discussing 
occassionally with his sub-editors possible equivalents 
to knotty political terms. Tlie word ' Bureaucracy ' in 
particular baffled him for a number of years and though 



332 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

he translated it by * Adhikari Varga, still he was not 
quite pleased with the expression. It was in the course 
of a lecture that the word * Nokarshahi ' occurred to 
him. So delighted was he with this word, that he 
called some of his literary friends at the end of the 
speech, and shared with them his joy at the addition of 
an extremely nice word to the Marathi vocabulary. 
Like the elephant of the story, Mr. Tilak's intellectual 
tusk, strong enough to bear the load of heavy timber, 
was also capable of lifting up a pin. His genius was 
.at once comprehensive and subtle. 

The expression " old wine in new bottles '* is gene- 
rally an empty compliment. Mr. Tilak's discussion of 
abstruse political theories, however, never struck his 
readers as something outlandish, something developed 
and prepared thousands of miles away and thence 
imported into India. His readers always felt at home 
with his writings and were never repelled by the EngHsh 
political thought which he discussed in Marathi. Mr. 
Tilak not only made his reader understand him, he made 
him also remember the main points in his writings. 
Some words, some expressions, some sentences in his 
articles always lingered in the memory of the reader. 
The article may be forgotten, but such words stick to 
the memory. Usually the title of the heading of the 
article was pithy and expressive. It summed up the 
whole of the article in some striking phrase. He always 
said that a good heading was worth half the writing. 

The object of the propagandist is to influence his 
readers. He seeks inspiration from the people, and 
returns it thousandfold. He receives instruction and 
imparts it at compound interest. Mr. Tilak bore this 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 333. 

truth in mind while conducting the Kesari. He con- 
centrated all his energies on the work of national 
awakening. Whatever helped that work found a place 
in the Kesari ; otherwise it was shunned, though the 
very best. People went to the Kesari, not to get news, 
but to interpret it. Their estimates of men and things 
were largely influenced by the Kesari. Their attitude 
was determined by that of the Kesari. A compliment 
from the Kesari has built up many a career ; its censure 
has marred it. Verily it has been a great dictator, 
though a benevolent one. 

This then, is the work of the Kesari. It has formed 
the style of Marathi Journalism ; it has expanded the 
thought-expressing capacity of the Marathi language. 
It has familiarised the people with the political thought 
of modern European life. It has widened the 
outlook of the sons of the soil. It has roused 
them to a consciousness of the glorious past and 
the wretched present. It has inspired them with 
new hope for the future. It has concentrated 
their attention to the live political issue ; and has 
mercilessly thrust in the back-ground, whatever was 
not directly concerned with that issue. It has set an 
example of devotion, of sacrifice, of plain speaking and 
of courage. It has taught them to keep their heads 
cool in storms and rear them again after the hurricane 
spent its force. It has been the centre of political edu- 
cation, the source of political agitation, and the pivot 
of aU national organization, in Western India. As one 
speaker aptly put it, it has transformed the Maharash- 
tra of 1890 to what it is in 192 1. 



## TILAK THE SCHOLAR 

To me it {i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant 
because it appeared in the midst of the author's direst persecu 
tion when money reputation, influence and everything were 
at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare 
a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles. 

H. W. Nevinson. 

npHE scholar in politics is either a remarkable fail- 
lure or an extraordinary success. In the scholar's 
temperament, hesitency, lack of strong will-power, im- 
patience and petulance usually form the chief mgrcdi- 
ents. His knowledge of men is limited ; his grasp of 
actualities is imperfect. He has no resourcefulness, 
very little courage or presence of mind. His person- 
ality is weak and he is very rarely a ruler of men. The 
failure as an administrator of M. Guizot, the celebrated 
philosopher-historian is a striking illustration of the 
danger of appointing men of letters at the helm of 
affairs. Mr. Tilak however was primarily a man of 
action. His wonderful and luminous scholarship and 
his versatile and comprehensive genius formed merely 
the back-ground of a strong-willed, fiery, masterful, 
soldierly personality. His scholarship illuminated his 
political leadership with a lustre as rare as it was daz- 
zling ; his political leadership gave his scholarl37 work 
a prestige and a significance totally absent in the efforts 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 335 

of mere scholars. If a scholar in politics is a rarity, a 
scholar-politician finding his way to gaol is still more so; 
and that, such a man should have lifted his thoughts 
from the chilling atmosphere of gaol-life and the excru- 
ciating pain which inevitably attends it, up to the re- 
gions of ethics and philosophy is, verily a wonder of 
wonders ! 

But this was not the only wonder. Mr. Tilak's every- 
day life was hardly more favourable to literary pur- 
suits than his gaol-life. It was a life of storm and 
stress. It is really surprizing that the din of political 
controversies enabled him to concentrate his mind on 
patient and laborious research. His first work, the 
Orion was planned and written in the midst of Social 
Reform controversies, the legacy of whose acrimony 
still abides ; the Arctic Home in the Vedas was com- 
pleted and published when Mr. Tilak was in the throes 
of a prosecution which was probably intended to strike 
at the very basis of his political and social position. 
It is this peace in the midst of storms and this serenity 
amid misery and obloquy that proves Mr. Tilak's " title 
to something far higher and greater than the honour of 
mere political leadership " or scholarly \visdom. In 
him we recognize '* the stuff of which the saints and 
seers of the race are made." 

Originality and versatility were the characteristics of 
Mr. Tilak's genius. Though he planned writing many 
books, he actually wrote only three — (i) the Orion 
(English) (2) the Arctic Home in the Vedas, (English) 
and (3) The Gila-RaJiasya (Marathi). The theme of each 
is new and arresting. The Orion takes the antiquity of 
the Vedas back to 6000 B.C., a claim which Western 



336 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

scholars have at last grudgingly accepted. The Arctic 
Home proves that the cradle of the Aryans was not the 
Caucasus mountain, but the effulgent region of the North 
Pole. Both these volumes have suggested new view- 
points and have compelled Sanskritists to revise their 
estimates regarding the early history of the Aryan 
race. Mr. Tilak's commentary on the Gita esta- 
blishes a new and convincing theory of Karma-yoga, 
These books are not mere compilations. They strike 
out a novel line of thought and research. The intellect 
of Gokhale and Telang was merely assimilative ; 
that of Tilak and Ranade was original and creative. 
In the Arctic Home, for instance, Mr. Tilak has given 
quite new and extremely convincing interpretations of 
nearly 80 verses in the Rig-veda, besides throwing ample 
light on more than twice the number. It should be 
remembered that these verses had baffled students of 
the Vedas from Sayana of the hoary past to the most 
recent Sanskrit scholar of Europe or America. Nor 
was this all. The Vedic Mythology, hitherto explained 
from Yaska downwards on the Storm or Dawn theory, 
had presented several knotty problems to the end of 
the last century and it was reserved for Mr. Tilak to 
establish the theory of " cosmic circulation of serial 
waters " by means of which the legends of Indra and 
Vritra, of Saptavadhri, of Aditi and her seven flourish- 
ing and one still born son, of Surya's wheel and of 
Dirghatamas, became fully intelligible. These studies 
filled his mind with a thousand and one new and inter- 
esting ideas regarding the evolution of the Hindu 
Religion and Philosophy. He was eager to develop 
these ideas and incorporate them in two or three 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 337 

volumes, but he had no hope of being able to do so, un- 
less, as he humourously said " Government was pleased 
to send him back to Mandalay for another period of 
six years. " 

Even the perfunctory and casual account he has given 
in the Arctic Home and the Gita-Rahasya, of the progress 
of the ancient Aryans in culture, shows that he was 
gifted with an imagination of a very high order ; Mr. 
Tilak's imagination was rather the solid, strong and 
mascuHne imagination of a scientist or a philosopher 
than the poet's which like " a beautiful and ineffectual 
angel " beats " in the void, his luminous wings." His 
short but suggestive article on the " Indian and the 
Chaldean Vedas " strikes out a new line of investigation 
not only in comparative philology but in the history 
of ancient Asia as well. In this article, Mr. Tilak 
starts with a quotation from the Atharva-Veda wherein 
he finds several words that look unsanskrit in origin, 
traces them to the Chaldean Vedas and then gives his 
arguments regarding inter-communication between India 
and Chaldea. 

Mr. Tilak's genius was at once comprehensive and 
subtle. '* In one swift gyre " it surveyed the whole 
extent of the subject in hand ; at the same time there 
was nothing too minute for its ken. He developed 
argument after argument, built up theory after theory, 
with the same enjojmient with which he descended to the 
exhaustive discussion of the grammatical and philological 
peculiarities of a word ; after surveying with his intel- 
lectual teleoscope the rise and progress of philosophical 
thoughts and systems, he did not disdain with micros- 
copic minuteness to trace a missing verse from a refer- 
22S 



338 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ence book {e. g. Sankhya-Karikas) or fix the Sanskrit 
definition of Hindu Epics. This subtlety of intellect 
enabled him to emend and correctly interpret all the 
verses of that knotty little book — the Vedanga-Jyotish. 

The clarity of his ideas and the rapidity with which 
he transmitted them to paper were really wonderful. 
The Arctic Home contains references to nearly 500 
learned volumes, and the Gita-Rahasya to nearly twice 
that number. He spent days, months and years in 
collecting and analyzing materials for his treatises. 
But once the materials were fully digested and the 
skeleton-notes prepared, he took very little time to write 
or dictate the book. Thus he worked at the Orion for 
nearly four years, at the Arctic Home for nearly nine, 
and at the Gita-Rahasya for more than twenty years. 
But the time he actually took to write these books was 
incredibly small. The Orion was finished in less than 
one month and the Arctic Home (about 450 Pages) in 
about two months. His magnum opus, t^e Gita" 
Rahasya required only five months. It was written 
in the winter of 1910-11 at Mandalay. 

The Mahabharat (and especially the Gita) and the 
Rig'veda were Mr. Tilak's favourite books. While read- 
ing the Gita in 1889, it occurred to hun " that impor- 
tant conclusions may be deduced from the statement of 
Krishna that ' he was Margashirsha of the months'." 
This led him to inquire into the primitive Vedic Calen- 
dar and in 1892 Mr. Tilak sent an essay on this subject 
to the Ninth Oriental Congress held in London and in 
the next year (1893) he published in book-form the re- 
sults of his four years' researches. In this book, Mr. Tilak 
abandoned the purely linguistic method of research of 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 339 

the Western scholars and adopted the astronomical one 
about the utility of which those scholars were rather 
doubtful. The book created a sensation and though it 
was at first perused with scepticism, still subsequently 
Max Mullec Weber Jacobi and other Sanskritists had 
to accept Mr. Tilak's conclusions and re-adjust their own 
in the light of Mr. Tilak's investigations. Dr. Bloom- 
field the celebrated Professor of Sanskrit, at the John 
Hopkin's University referring to the Orion said (1894): — 
" But a literary event of even greater importance 
has happened within the last two or three months — an 
event which is certain to stir the world of science and 
culture far more than the beatific reminiscences. Some 
twelve weeks ago, I received from India a small duo- 
decimo volume, in the clumsy get-up and faulty typo- 
graphy of the native Anglo-Indian Press. It came 
with the regards of the author, a person totally unknown 
to fame. I had never heard his name. * * *. It wiU 
be understood that the entry of the little volume upon 
my horizon was not such as to prejudice me in its favour, 
and secondly, I placed it where it might be reached, 
without too much effort, in the drowsy after-dinner 
hour, to be disposed of, along with much second-class 
matter such as reaches a scholar through the channels 
of the Postal Union. Nor was the preface ai all en- 
couraging. The author blandly informs us that the 
age of the Rigveda, cannot be less than 4000 years before 
Christ and that the express records of the Hindu anti- 
quity point back to 6000 before Christ. Having in 
mind the boundless fancy of the Hindu through the 
ages and his particularly fatal facility for * taking his 
mouthful ' when it comes to a question of numbers.

proposed to myself to continue to turn the leaves of 
the book with the amused smile of orthodoxy befitting 
the occassion. But soon the amused smile gave way 
to an uneasy sense that something unusual had hap- 
pened. I was first impressed with something leonine in 
the way in which the author controlled the Vedic lite- 
rature and the occidental works on the same ; my su- 
perficial reading was soon replaced by absorbed study, 
and finally, having been prepared to scoff mildly, I con- 
fess that the author had convinced me in all the essen- 
tial points. The book is unquestionably the literary sen- 
sation of the year ; history, the chronic readjuster shall 
have her hands uncommonly full to assimilate the result 
of Tilak's discovery and arrange her paraphernalia in 
the new perspective." 

After the publication of the Orion, Mr. Tilak carried 
on correspondence with Prof. Max Muller on various 
philological and astronomical points. Like some chro- 
nic fever, the subject pursued him, despite the claims 
which political work had upon his time and energy. 
The years 1895-97 were, indeed, some of the busiest 
years of his life ; but all the same, Vedic chronology 
formed a strong undercurrent of his thoughts. This 
was a peculiarity with Mr. Tilak. Frequently he could 
so withdraw his mind from work, that only the lighter 
moods occupied him. But when a subject 'possessed' 
him, it gave him no rest, it tormentated him even in 
his sleep. Before such a powerful concentration it was- 
no wonder that Saraswati yielded the keys of her 
treasures. Throughout the busy years of the Poona 
Congress, the Famine, the Plague, the Councillorship 
and the Press-prosecutions in the Bombay Presidency^ 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34I 

the little leisure he could snatch was given to Vedic 
•studies. In 1897, he was sentenced to rigorous impri- 
sonment ; and what time he could get in the Yeravda 
Jail, was devoted to the continuation of his Vedic re- 
searches. The first manuscript of the Arctic Home 
was written at the end of 1898, but Mr. Tilak hesitated 
to publish the book for a long time " because the hues 
of investigation had ramified into many allied sciences 
"Such as geology, archaeology, comparative mythology 
and so on " and as Mr. Tilak thought himself to be a 
layman in these, he felt some diffidence as to whether 
he had " correctly grasped the bearings of the latest re- 
searches in these siences." Unable in India to find a 
University atmosphere where one could get all up-to- 
date information on any desired subject, the only course 
open for Mr. Tilak was, in the words of Prof. Max Muller 
'* to step boldly out of his own domain and take an in- 
dependent survey " of the aUied sciences like Geology, 
€ven at the risk of being called " an interloper, an 
ignoramus, a mere dilettante." After completely satis- 
fying himself on all the different points, Mr. Tilak 
published the book (1903) which was more favourably 
received by Western scholars than the Orion. 

Like the early editorial writing of Mr. Tilak, the 
Orion was written in what may be called the scholar's 
style. But the Arctic Home is a book which even the 
lay reader can peruse with enjoyment. The style is 
smooth, flowing, and extremely lucid, occasionally 
rising to the heights of philosophical eloquence. The 
treatment is at once interesting and methodical. After 
stating the problem in brief, Mr. Tilak treats of the 
Glacial Period and prores from geological evidence of 



342 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

fossil, fauna and flora that " in the early geological 
ages, when the Alps were low and the Himalayas not 
yet upheaved, and when Asia and Africa were repre- 
sented only by a group of islands, * * * an equable 
and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface 
of the globe as a result of these geographical conditions." 
Mr. Tilak then describes the Polar and circumpolar cha* 
racteristics. The former are : (i) the sun rises in the 
South (2) the stars do not rise and set but revolve in 
horizontal planes (3) the year consists only of one long 
day and one long night of six months each (4) the sun 
rises and sets only once a year but the twilight, whether 
of the morning or of the evening lasts continuously for 
about two mo7iths. The circum-polar characteristics 
are (i) The sun will always be to the South of the zenith 
of the observer. (2) A large number of stars are above 
the horizon, during the entire period of their revolu- 
tion and hence, always visible. (3) The year is made 
up of three parts (a) one long continuous night ; (b) one 
long continuous day (c) a succession of ordinary days 
and nights. (4) The dawn, at the close of the long 
continuous night lasts for several days. Mr. Tilak; 
says " if a Vedic description or tradition discloses any 
of the characteristics mentioned above, we may safely 
infer that th6 tradition is polar or circum-polar in origin 
and the phenomenon, if not actually witnessed by the 
poet, was at least known to him by tradition faithfully 
handed down from generation to generation." Mr. 
Tilak then quotes many such passages and traditions 
and proves the existence of the Arctic Home. He sup- 
ports his conclusions by studies in comparative mytho- 
logy and by quotations from the Avesta "which express 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 343 

ly tell us that the happy land of Airy ay a Vaejo or the 
Aryan Paradise, was located in a region where the sun 
shone but once a year, and that it was destroyed by the 
invasion of snow and ice, which rendered its climate 
inclement." 

Here is an Anglo-Indian estimate of Mr. Tilak's book. 
Prof. Fraser, editor of the Indian Education thus writes 
about the Arctic Home in the Vedas : — 

** We regret we cannot enter into a critical review 
of this book ; but we gladly assist to make it 
known and pay a short tribute to the clear style 
in which it is written throughout. All readers 
will appreciate this; Indian students not least. It 
is well and carefuUy printed and presented in an 
attractive cover. Unfortunately^ the binding is 
very weak and this a great pity in the case of a 
book which has a permanent value. It is fast- 
ened with wire instead of being sewn ; this is a 
feeble sort of binding in any case. In India, the 
wire soon rusts and this causes the paper to rot 
and leaves to become loose." 
Apparently the Une of Addison's Tom Folio is not 
yet extinct ! 

In the course of his Vedic studies Mr. Tilak found 
that, in spite of the valuable initial help, which the 
commentators give, it is on the whole better to carry 
research work in ancient hterature, unfettered by the 
occasionally wrong lead given by the so-called authori- 
ties. It was only when Mr. Tilak rejected Sayana on one 
hand, and Prof. Max Muller on the other that he could 
make valuable contribution to the interpretation of the 
Vedas, He tried the same method with the Gita. Hq 



344 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

was first introduced to this book during his father's 
last illness ; at that time Mr. Tilak was barely i6. In 
the stillness of evening, he would sit by the lamp-side 
and read out to his father the Gita and its Marathi 
commentary. The sublime melody of the Gita charmed 
him and since then he was a devoted student of the 
Lord's Song. But, almost from the time of his first 
perusal of the book, a doubt haunted his mind. The 
great Shankaracharya has pronounced the Gita to have 
preached Jnyana, unqualified by Karman. Can it be 
so ? If yes, how are we to reconcile the fact that 
Arjuna was moved, by the Lord's Message, to do that 
Karman, which had repelled him ? The commenta- 
tors are silent. Indeed, most of them entirely neglect 
the first chapter and start their commentaries from the 
nth verse of chapter second. Wearied by the wrong 
lead given by the commentators, Mr. Tilak read the 
original repeatedly without the aid of any commentary, 
till at last, be found that the Gita, far from being a book 
of cold philosophy, was a guide for every day life, a 
master-piece on Karmayoga Shastra. The more 
did he discuss this subject with contemporary 
scholars, the more was he convinced of the strength 
of his contention, until at last he determined to 
give his researches out to the public. But that 
was not an easy matter. The anti-Partition agita- 
tion made Mr. Tilak the leader of All-India Party » 
and all his time was swallowed up by Politics- 
He had given up the attempt as hopeless and when 
in July 1908, he was sentenced to six years' trans- 
portation, even the last lingering chance was 
apparently lost, for no-body ever expected him to 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 345 

■survive the dreary period. But the subsequent com- 
mutation of his sentence to one of simple imprisonment 
together with the Hterary facihties afforded, en- 
abled him to undertake the enterprise and within less 
than twenty months after he was " well settled " at 
Mandalay, he wrote in a letter as follows : — 

" About the Gita, I have finished what I call Gita 
Rahasya, an independent and original book investiga- 
ting the purpose of the Gita and showing how our reli- 
gious philosophy is applied therein to solution of the 
ethical problem. For, my view of the Gita is, that 
it is a work on Ethics — not Utilitarian, nor intuitional 
but transcendental, somewhat on the lines followed in 
the Green's ' Prolegomena to Ethics .' I have com- 
pared, throughout, the Gita-philosophy with the West- 
em, both religious and ethical and have tried to show 
that our system is, to say the least, not inferior to any 
of the Western methods. This Rahasya is made up 
of 15 chapters with an appendix devoted to a critical 
examination of the ,Gita as part of the Mahabharat 
and discussing its age etc. * * * j^ ^ill i think 
fill about 300 or 350 pages. To this a translation of 
the Gita, according to my view of it, is yet to be 
appended and I am now engaged on this 
translation, which, by the bye, is a light task. * * * 
I believe it will be found to be an entirely 
-original book like the " Orion "; for so far as 
I am aware, no one has ventured on such a path 
before in translating or commenting on the Gita, 
though I have had this view of the Gita in mind 
for about the last twenty years and more. I 
have used all the books that I have here with me 



346 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

but there are references to works, not with me 
here, and as these are quoted from memory, they will 
have to be verified before publishing the book * * * 
Kant's ' Critique of Pure Reason ' and * Green's Prole- 
gomena to Ethics ' are the main English authorities for 
my book which is based on the Brahmasutras (Shankara- 
charya's Bhashya) and the Mahabharat * * * and 
it treats in brief, the Hindu Philosophy of active life." 

The book — a ponderous volume of 854 closely-print- 
ed pages — was, published (1915) a few months after 
Mr. Tilak was set free. The first edition — 6000 copies — 
was sold off within a week. The second and third edi- 
tions were also soon exhausted. The book has been 
translated into Gujarati, Hindi and Kanarese and Mr. 
Tilak proposed to get it rendered into Bengali, Telgu, 
Tamil and other leading vernaculars of India. It was 
his intention to give out his researches to the Western 
countries but as that was a work which could not con- 
veniently be left to mere translators, Mr. Tilak intend- 
ed to do it himself. 

But that was not to be ; nor was this the only 
literary project he left unfinished. With life and 
leisure, he would have brought out treatises on 
(i) The Differential and Integral Calculas (2) The 
Hindu Law (3) and Politics. Regarding (i) he had 
collected all the necessary materials and digested 
them. A few months' leisure and the book would 
have been ready. The same remark holds good 
about his intended book on Politics. His sudden 
death was a loss not only to the PoUtical but 
also to the Literary World. Even Mr. Tilak's 
opponents will admit that during its life, the University 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34/ 

of Bombay has not produced a more versatile or 
original genius. Its semi-official character may not 
have enabled it to honour itself by honouring Mr. 
Tilak. India, however, gratefully recognises that the 
literary recreation of Mr. Tilak has accomplished far 
brighter and more enduring results than the works of 
many a professional Sanskritist. 



## LOKAMANYA TILAK AND MAHATMA GANDHI 

Yet this is not the whole man. You cannot say this is he, 
that is he. All that you can say with certainty is that he is 
here, he is there. Everywhere his influence reigns, his .autho- 
rity rules, his elusive personality pervades ; and this must be 
so, for it is true of all great men that they are incalculable, 
beyond definition. They partake of the nature of the Illimi- 
table and the Eternal from which they have sprung and to 
which they are bound. With their feet firm-set on earth and 
their hands among the stars, they are pointers of the way to 
those who search, encouragers of the faint and weary, inspirers 
of those breathing in deep draughts of hope. 

H. 5. Polak on M. K. Gandhi. 
"VrOW that Lokamanya Tilak, the Hercules of Indian 
nationahsm is no more and Mahatma Gandhi 
has succeeded to the leadership of the country, it will 
not be out of place to compare and contrast some of 
their character estics. It goes without saying, that the 
lives of both Lokamanya Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi 
were dedicated to the cause of the country. Mr. Tilak 
had a prevision of his ultimate destiny while 
yet a college student. Immediately after pass- 
ing the LL. B. examination, he set his back on 
the emoluments of the legal profession and the 
prospect of becoming a High Court Judge an^ 



LOKAMANYA TILAK AND MAHATMA GANDHI 349 

became a poor school-master. He resisted also that 
still greater attraction of the career of a scholar, poring 
over volumes and making immortal researches, — a task^ 
for which, he was eminently qualified — and unreserved- 
ly accepted the life of a public man, so wasteful of time 
and productive of ephemeral literature. The dedica- 
tion of Mr. Gandhi came a little late, but certainly not 
very late. Mr. Tilak's course appears self-sought and 
selected ; Mr. Gandhi's accidental and providential. 
Once Mr. Gandhi planted his foot in South Africa, his 
career was fixed and his heroic work in the Land of 
Diamonds will form one of the most splendid and inspi- 
ring chapters in the history of India. The struggle, in 
which he was engaged there, was eminently spiritual. 
It was that losing struggle, with its terrible vicissitudes 
that called forth all his moral and spiritual powers. 
With a small band of desperate and patriotic Indians, 
surrounded by an extremely unsymapthetic and selfish 
white population which was eager to take advantage 
of every weakness of their opponents it is small wonder 
that Mr. Gandhi fought out the battle on the spiritual 
plane. He tested and developed his powers in 
a struggle with opponents who depended on mere physi- 
cal force. " More important than even the success in 
our endeavours, is the development of our character in 
this struggle. Let success come or not, we have gained 
by the gain of spirituality." So said he once, while re- 
ferring to the South African compaign. The struggle, in 
which Mr. Tilak was engaged, was essentially different 
from this. It was largely intellectual and spiritual 
only partially. A vast country governed recklessly, 
despotically and unsympathetically by a handful of 



350 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

foreigners^ with the children ot the soil mostly 
inert, the educated class timid, weak and 
vacillating — such was the India, which young 
Tilak saw. Knowing that he was wanted for the 
work of uplift, he threw himself, heart and soul, into 
the breach. Impatient to get freedom, he wanted all 
to concentrate on the political issue. The Age of Con- 
sent controversy separated him from the bulk of the 
Reformers, the circumstances of the Hindu-Mahomedan 
riots marked him out for Bureaucratic attentions. 
Honours were tried, but they did not ensnare him ; and 
then, all the concentrated ire, of a small but powerful 
clique of officials burst upon him ; that too left him 
unnerved and undaunted. His Famine and Plague agi- 
tations are well-known and thev were followed in a 
few years by the Swadeshi Movement and then the 
Home Rule Propaganda. It will thus be seen, that 
Mr. Tilak 's mission called forth more varied qualities of 
the head and the heart. His career exhibits the tacti- 
cal cleverness of a politician, the far-sight of a states- 
man, the coolness of a philosopher, the profundity of a 
scholar and the fervid spirit of a martyr. These differ- 
ent hues, imperceptibly blended with one another, make 
his character as charming to the historian as the rain- 
bow is to the artist. Mr. Gandhi's greatness is more 
uniform. The rigorous discipline, with which he has 
built up his character, has made him as great and sacri- 
ficing in the petty details of his life as in his leadership of 
his countrymen. His dress, diet, habits, talk, every move- 
ment from him reflects the intense fervour of his lumi- 
nous spirituahty. Mr. Tilak 's greatness was the rugged, 
uneven loftiness of the Himalayas ; while that of Mr^ 



LOKAMANYA TILAK AND MAHATMA GANDHI 35 1 

Gandhi puts us in mind of a mountain-fastness with 
its strong-built walls and parapets, every nook and 
comer, properly guarded and utilised for defence. In 
every day life, Mr. Tilak seemed an ordinary gentleman 
with nothing remarkably wonderful about him. It was 
only when the moment for thought or action came, that 
you saw him at his best, with his armour on. He never 
liked to keep the burden of his mail on his person the 
whole day long. Mr. Gandhi works, in the language of 
Milton, always " in his great Task-Master's eye." 
Every small detail of his life, private or public, is to 
him of the utmost account, to be regulated in accord- 
ance with definite principles followed with military 
rigour. Asleep or awake, walking or talking, in thought 
or action, he is the same Mahatma with his eyes fixed 
on High. This utter holiness of life mellows the daz- 
zling heroic qualities he possesses. If, for instance, Mr. 
Tilak's courage blinded both friend and foe, 
the courage of Mr. Gandhi is most delightful 
to the eye because he has softened it to a point, at 
which we can bear its light. To a Justice Davar, Mr. 
Tilak would reply with proud and flashing defiance. 
Mr. Gandhi, equally gifted with courage would 
moderate its lustre with the same care with 
which an Indian physician medicates mercury. Mr. 
Tilak's utterances seem addressed to others, Mr. Gandhi's 
nothing but a loud soliloquy. While Mr. Tilak is talk- 
ing to others, Mr. Gandhi thinks aloud. 

It is admitted on aU hands that both Mr. Gandhi 
and Mr. Tilak have been the two most towering leaders 
of the age. Their leadership too, reveals certain pecu- 
liarities, characteristic of the temperament of each. 



352 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Both of them have been worshippers of their own cons- 
cience. But they have never, Hke the Moderate 
leaders, emphasied their disagreement with the people. 
Both have considered leadership to be the capacity to 
interpret and appreciate the national sentiment and to 
conduct it in the most constructive channels. But 
there has been one difference. During the last thiry 
years, Mr. Tilak, with unerring astuteness, not only 
understood the will of the people, but had the elasticity 
to interpret it in action, with the result, that his leader- 
ship was continuous. With regard to Mr. Gandhi, 
though his hands have always been on the pulse of the 
people, and though he has been uniformly in sympathy 
and general agreement with his countrymen on the 
political issues, still he has not always cared to lead 
them. When the whole of India was astir and aglow 
with enthusiasm under the banner of Mrs. Besant and 
Mr. Tilak, Mr. Gandhi, carried away by his chivalrous 
regard for the difficulties of John Bull, was compara- 
tively silent, though fully sympathetic. I am sure, if 
to-morrow the way to the national freedom is to lie 
through the Reformed Councils, Mr. Gandhi would 
disdain to go there and would very likely retire to his 
Ashram at Sabarmati. On the other hand, Mr, Tilak 
would have been in the Councils at the head of the mili- 
tant Congressmen fighting every inch of the ground 
with his ready, resourceful and astute brain. In fact, 
the intellectual and moral leadership of Mr. Tilak had 
immense possibilities. Born three hundred years ago,, 
he would have been the Shivajee of the Mahratta 
people ; Mr. Gandhi would have contented himself with 
becoming a Ramdas. Born a hundred years hence. 



LOKAMANYA TILAK AND MAHATMA GANDHI 353 

Mr. Tilak would be the President of the United States 
of India ; Mr. Gandhi, if at all he cares to join the public 
movement, would be the gentlest but most uncompro- 
mising opponent of capitalism. To take yet one in- 
stance more, in the 8th century, Mr. Tilak would have 
been the Shankaracharya of those times, driving Bud- 
dhism out of India with all the weapons of his wonderful 
scholarship. Mr. Gandhi, instead of fighting intellec- 
tually, would have assimilated in his character the 
noblest features of Buddhism and Neo-Hinduism. There 
is no limit to the roles Mr. Tilak would have played ; 
Mr. Gandhi's parts would be few. It is impossible to 
think of him as we can think of Mr. Tilak, as the foreign 
minister of India. What, however, Mr. Tilak gains in 
breadth and variety, Mr. Gandhi does in depth and 
intensity. Hitherto there has been no political worker 
who has fought with spiritual weapons. To Mr. Gandhi 
politics is the hand-maid of spirituality ; with Mr. Tilak, 
the case was perhaps, the reverse. There has been, 
I think, no fighter in the political world in modern 
times who has never used a single angry word. Mr. 
Tilak's love of strong language is well-known. He 
never hit below the belt but he gave his opponent na 
quarter. Mr. Gandhi's political language has always 
been the language of a Buddha or a Christ. Every 
word he utters has a " blessing behind it and a peace 
before it." It is an honour to the Bureaucracy that 
their foremost opponent is a moral and spiritual giant. 
Mr. Tilak's leadership was hard-earned and challenged 
at every step, while that;, of Mr. Gandhi can 
be described in the language of Caesar. " I 
came, I saw, I conquered." In his South Africaa 
23

struggles, where Mr. Gandhi forged his spiritual wea- 
pons, he was^the unquestioned leader of a small group 
of Indians, nobly, though hopelessly, trying to assert 
their manhood ; when he returned to India, to his own 
province, the throne of political leadership was empty. 
His leadership of the Non-co-operation propoganda, too, 
is absolute and he has no second. Mr. Tilak had con- 
tinuously to struggle against a strong combination of 
leaders from whose views he differed. In the very be- 
ginning of his political career, in the early nineties, he 
had to" put up a strong fight against such stalwarts as 
Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Bhandarkar, while the 
second rank of leaders too, contained such brilliant 
personalities as Messrs. Agarkar and Chandavarkar. 
In the essentially spiritual fight of to-day, the brilliant 
galaxy of intellectual leaders has to sit at the feet of 
the towering spiritual personality of Mr. Gandhi, and 
the only leader who possessed in a pre-eminent degree 
that spiritual spark which has made Mr. Gandhi invin- 
cible has, unfortunately for Mr. Gandhi and for us all, 
passed away on the fateful first of August 1920 ! 

The general run of political workers, all over the 
world, have so little to say to humanity at large. To 
suffering, struggling and questioning humanity, they 
have no message ; what little they teach is only indirect- 
ly, as a result of the better part of their activities. 
Their minds are insular and cannot leave the usual 
groove of thoughts. Their time is not their own, the 
dust and heat of controversy is distracting and des- 
tructive of concentration. It is not therefore surpri- 
sing that so few of the Indian leaders have to say some- 
thing new, something worth hearing on the pro- 



LOKAMANYA TILAK AND MAHATMA GANDHI 355 

blems of humanity. So far as I know, it is only 
Mrs. Besant, Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Tilak and Mr. 
Arabindo Ghose who have given us their out- 
look on some of the questions, confronting mankind. 
We may leave the names of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Ghose 
as not bearing upon our subject here. While, both 
Tilak and Gandhi have deUvered their message to 
mankind, each has done so in a characteristic way. 
Mr. Tilak's message is general ; Mr. Gandhi's is particu- 
lar. With his intellectual sweep, Mr. Tilak absorbed in 
his own brain the culture of the East and the West 
and has given us the gospel of his Karma Yoga. Mr. 
Gandhi has put all the institutions and leading thoughts 
of the modern civilization to the touch-stone of his 
truthful, pure, and loving heart and has condemned 
them as grossly material. To the nations madly 
careering after the senses, Mr. Tilak cries ' Halt ' and 
bids them look inward. Mr. Gandhi also, would stop 
them and tell them to reform their life and institutions. 
Mr. Tilak gives them the key to introspection and self- 
elevation in ' work without motive ;' Mr. Gandhi calls 
upon them to destroy the machine-made, machine- 
dependant and machine-making soul-less civilization and 
on its ruins build a purer, grander and simpler life. 
The intellectual boldness of Mr. Tilak enabled him to 
free himself from the shackles of all commentators 
and study tlie message of Lord Krishna at first hand ; 
while the moral intrepidity of Mr. Gandhi throws away- 
all cant and book-lore and having unfalteringly examin- 
ed each detail of modem Ufe and civilization, accepts or 
rejects it, according as it agrees with his basic ideals. In 
the enforced leisure at Mandalay, Mr, Tilak has given 



356 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

his message that intellectual setting, without which» 
no message, however grand, can be expected to last 
permanently ; happy would be the day when some fol- 
lower of Mr. Gandhi would present his master's thoughts 
with all the intellectual paraphernalia of science, eco- 
nomics and sociology. 



## GENERAL REFLECTIONS 

We can sacrcely express the admiration which we feel for 
a mind so great and at the same time so healthy and well-pro- 
portioned, so willingly contracting itself to the humblest 
duties, so easily expanding itself to the highest, so contended in 
repose so powerful in action. Every part of this virtuous and 
blameless life is not hidden from us in modest privacy is a 
splendid-portion of our national history. 

Macaulay on John Hampden 

rSlHE playground of Eton might have trained up the 
conqueror of Napoleon ; but it is characteristic 
either of the circumstances in India or of our college- 
life or of both, that Mr. Tilak owed absolutely nothing 
to his alma mater. None of his fellow-students or pro- 
fessors could foretell his future career; none size up the 
vast potentialities of the man. To most of his fellow- 
students, Mr. Tilak,— Mr. Blunt, as they preferred to call 
him — appeared as a young man of rather extra- ordinary 
abihties but certainly not of extra-ordinary ambition 
or application, extremely obstinate, somewhat 
domineering, simple and kind-hearted. Even to 
Ranade, the most observant man of the time, the memor- 
able ist of January 1880 appeared only to usher in 
the second stage of our public life. Even he, scarcely 
reahzed that a dynamic personality had appeared in 
the stagnant waters of our national life, — a personality 



358 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

that was destined to measure its strength with ail 
others and ultimately to triumph over them all. The 
progress of Mr. Tilak was challenged at every step. On 
the one hand, there was a strong body of Liberal and 
Moderate leaders — Ranade, Mehta, Telang, Wacha, 
Bhandarkar, to name only a few — and on the other the 
vast forces of the powerful Bureaucracy despotically 
ruling over the land. Alternately, simultaneously, Mr. 
Tilak knocked the one or the other. He, in his turn, 
received blows at every step, at every turn. Some- 
times, it appeared as if, he was done for, that he had 
ceased to count as a factor in public life and would be 
required to recede, crest-fallen, into the background. 
Defeat after defeat was inflicted upon him, and on 
many occassions, it appeared that the epitaph on his 
career could be written. But sphinx-like, he arose 
out of the ashes of every defeat more and more powerful 
until at last his opponents, deserted, defeated and con- 
founded had to make room for him. 

To fight with practically all the foremost men of one's 
time and with an extremely powerful bureaucracy to 
boot, one must be nothing less than a dare-devil — in the 
noblest and best sense of the term. Even to attempt 
such a fight is creditable ; to do it with effect is still 
more so and to win laurels therein is reserved only for 
a rare hero. It was even so with Mr. Tilak. The equip 
ment with which Mr. Tilak commenced his life-work 
was immense. His genius was of the highest order. 
Its most distinguished feature was originality. Read- 
ers of his Gita Rahasya marvel at the calm assurance 
with which he quietly sets aside the authority and tradi- 
tional interpretations of the last two thousand years^ 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 359 

To the study of the Gita, Mr. Tilak brought a mind un- 
trammelled by tradition, undeterred by authority and 
unrestrained by expediency. So in every department 
of life and thought — politics included — ^his genius must 
run its course, heedless of tradition, authority or expe- 
diency. It was absolutely impossible for his fiery and 
passionate spirit as also for his restless and original 
mind to acquiesce in the easy-going, desultory and irre- 
solute pubUc life of the day. Where would it lead us ? 
What was its goal ? Will these widow-marriages and 
all that make men of us ? Will they break the bonds 
of foreign domination that has enchained and well-nigh 
paralyzed us ? To him British Government was an 
evil — to be tolerated, to be made the best of, but after- 
all an evil, which has crushed us politically, socially, 
industrially, and spiritually. Therein he saw no " Di- 
vine dispensation of an inscrutable Providence." Two 
generations of educated Indians had been lauding, 
with a rare exception, the greatness of our English 
" deliverers "; Mr. Tilak refused to dance to the tune. 
Two generations of educated Indians had swallowed 
all the sneers and gibes at Indian society in which the 
English officials and missionaries indulged ; far from 
uttering a word of protest, the English-educated Indians 
had based their programme of Social Reform on that 
condemnation. Mr. Tilak could not agree with them. 
Two generations of educated Indians had pinned their 
faith on the benevolence, righteousness and humanity 
of the present rulers of India ; Mr. Tilak, gifted with a 
more correct perception of the state of things relied 
more on the people than on the conquerors, for the great 
consummation of all our ambitions ; and the man, who 



360 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

rejected the authority of all the Acharyas in the interpre- 
tation of the Gita, the man who rejected the reasoning of 
all European scholars with regard to the antiquity of 
the Vedas and the cradle of the Aryan civilisation — 
this same man rejected methods of Ranade, Telang, 
Mandlik, Bhau Daji and all the time-honoured leaders 
of the people and struck out a new path in public life. 
To challenge in this way the work of two generations, 
requires a degree of no ordinary courage. To strike 
out a new path in the public life almost in opposition 
to the previous generation requires vision of the first 
order ; and the pecuHar path selected by Mr. Tilak 
called for self-sacrifice of the highest degree. Mr. 
Tilak rushed into the arena of national activities fully 
gifted with this vision, courage and self-sacrifice. An- 
other man was there, Mr. Tilak's peer in every quality 
of the head and heart — Vishnushastri Chiploonkar. 
Another man yet, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, a smaller 
chip of the same block. His broken health and strain- 
ed circumstances, later on somewhat altered the angle 
of Agarkar's vision. But throughout his eventful life, 
Mr. Tilak was found equal to any sacrifice, a match 
for any misfortune. He took up the work of national 
uplift in true Jesuitical spirit. Utter renunciation was 
his watchword. He even regretted that his father 
should have got him married ; and now that he was a 
married man, he must seek for ' maintenance allow- 
ance ;' but barring that, every pie he would get would 
belong to his country. The hfe-long simplicity of Mr. 
Tilak's dress and living was due to this vow of poverty ; 
and the purity of his life — so conspicuously and deser- 
vedly recognised by all his contemporaries — instinctive 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 361 

at first, was fortified by his gradual gaining in spiritual 
stature. 

It will thus be seen that the moral and intellectual 
outlook with which Mr. Tilak started his career was 
essentially novel and was destined to bring about 
nothing less than a revolution in the public life of the 
country. The older generation of leaders, however, 
had a merry time of it for the next eleven years owing 
to Mr. Tilak's long diversion and total absorption in 
the New English School and the Fergusson College. 
Three great idolas — to use a Baconian expression — had 
seized hold of the public mind in India during the last 
sixty years and diverted the nation from pursuing its 
first duty, — freedom from foreign domination. To-day 
we recognize that there can be no National Education 
without a National Government. We now realise that 
there can be no true Social Reform without and before 
political reform. We have learnt to our cost that 
there can be no regeneration of the national industries 
unless and until political power is wrested from the 
representatives of foreign capitalists. Education, Social 
Reform, Industrial Development — all must wait and 
make room for political reform. But about 1880 people 
thought differently ; and so Ranade ran after the lure 
of Social Reform, Tilak and Agarkar attempted to start 
National Education, Kunte and others tried to intro- 
duce western industries in the unmanured soil of our 
country. The attempts failed to achieve the intended 
result. To be sure, a certain amount of progress did 
result ; but at what cost ? Mr. Tilak's dedication of 
eleven years to a school :ind a college may have made 
him a bit less idealistic and more conversant with men 



3^2 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and affairs. It may have enabled him to equip himself 
the better for the mission of his life. But at the same 
time, we must not forget, that he lost eleven precious 
years of political leadership. Eleven years! and to a 
man Hke Mr. Tilak ! What a world of difference it 
would have made ! As it was, when lesser men were 
dominating the public life, and moulding the national 
will, Mr. Tilak was busy teaching Statistics and Astro- 
nomy, Sanskrit and Science to college students, figting 
all the while with the ever-growing clique which ulti- 
mately threw him out. In the first Session of the 
Indian National Congress, the first resolution was moved 
by the late Mr. G. Subramania Aiyar, born in 1856, 
the year of Mr. Tilak's birth ; while he, Mr. Tilak was 
at Poona shaping the infant college into life and strength. 
It is impossible and at the same time idle to discuss the 
possibilities, had Mr. Tilak started life as the sole editor 
of the Kesari and the Mahratta. But it is just possible 
that in his pursuit of what proved to be a phantom, the 
process of galvanizing the Congress and the public life 
of the country was delayed by a decade. 

Within the walls of the school and the college, soon 
after their existence was assured, a struggle awaited 
Mr. Tilak which gave a rude shock to his innate idealism. 
It was a struggle between a great man and compara- 
tively small men, between idealism and worldly wisdom, 
between unbending adherence to the original understand- 
ing and the demands of worldly ease. These differences 
were probably aggravated by the introduction of 
personal element. There is no thought more humilia- 
ting to ordinary minds than the growing consciousness 
that the man, whom in school or in college we re- 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 365 

garded more or less as an equal, stands head and shoul- 
der over us and extorts greater, more ardent homage from 
the world at large. It is not impossible that such an ele- 
ment found its way into the otherwise noble heart of 
Agarkar, who generally led the opposition against Mr. 
Tilak ; and when such a paragon of sacrifice raised the 
issues, need we wonder that Apte joined him, Apte, 
who at the very time of joining the Society is said to 
have stipulated for relaxation with respect to the ori- 
ginal agreement about extra income ? The cry was 
catching and was taken up by others, even by Mr. 
Gokhale whose ardent love of the Motherland and 
sterling sacrifices in her cause are well known. Then 
came the differences of opinions with regard to Social 
Reform on which Mr. Agarkar was so keen; and they are 
supposed to have accelerated the breach. It is also 
just possible that the party led by Ranade might have 
been led, by instincts of self-preservation, to exploit 
the already delicate situation and utilise the discon- 
tented element in the Deccan Education Socity for the 
enhancement of its prestige, which since 1880 had been 
steadily dwindling. For eleven long years, Mr. Tilak had 
been trying to enlist the active sympathy or patronage 
of all that was best, most thoughtful, most influential in 
the Bombay Presidency in the cause of the Society ; 
what must have been his disappointment and mrotifi- 
cation to find that after all this laborious fabric had been 
erected, ensuring the permanent existence and the 
prosperity of the institution, he was made to feel that 
he was no longer required and that for his own peace 
he had better walk away ? Had the majority of the 
members been grateful even by a tittle for the construe- 



364 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

tive and organizing work done by Mr. Tilak, when most 
of them were nobodies, they would not, like rebellious 
children, have stooped to pass a vote of censure upon 
the father of the institution. The Hon. Mr. Paranjpye 
might find it convenient to ridicule the public which 
sympathised with Mr. Tilak on the occasion of his re- 
tirement from the Society, but the public v^as not far 
in the wrong and Mr. Tilak was really the victim of 
incessant intrigues aimed mainly at his downfall. 

When, in 1890, Mr. Tilak left the D. E. Society, he 
found himself almost shunned by the intelligentia of 
Poona. A less courageous and enterprising man would 
not have survived this defeat. Nor were his oppo- 
nents willing to let him alone. A most foolish, uncalled- 
for legislation was undertaken by the Government of 
India as a concession to the continual pressure brought 
upon them by the leading lights of Social Reform. Mr. 
Tilak opposed it tooth and nail but was prepared for a 
reasonable compromise. The turn-headed reformers, 
however, brooked no conciliation. Mr. Tilak was stig- 
matised as an incendiary, a destructive worker. The air 
was thick with his condemnation. Feelings ran so high 
that whatever was opposed by Mr. Tilak was liked and 
supported by his opponents. The Sharada Sadan, an 
institution conducted by a Christian lady, had begun 
to develop unhealthy features. The original compact 
was gradually being set aside, and Christianity insidi- 
ously sought to be preached. Mr. Tilak got scent of 
the matter. He raised a note of warning. At once 
like mad dogs, his opponents rushed at him, " Mr. 
Tilak was an enemy of female education !" " Cut 
him !" At last after more than one year of quibbling. 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 365. 

shuffling and prevarication, the leaders of Social Reform 
had the decency to withdraw their support from the 
school which is now purely and avowedly a Christian 
institution. In spite of the cold shoulder that was 
given to him, in spite of the cold way in which he was 
made to understand that he was a busy-body, a mortal 
in the midst of gods, Mr. Tilak attended the annual 
sessions of the Social Conference and tried to infuse in 
them a more constructive and responsible spirit. But 
it was to no effect. A certain Rao Bahadur, a lieute- 
nant of Ranade, openly declared that unless Mr. Tilak 
was dead, things would not work smoothty. This was 
too much for human nature to bear. Utterly disgusted 
with the autocratic and unthinking way in which the 
the Social Conference was conducted, Mr. Tilak left it 
and practically ceased taking interest in the work. 
But his opponents would not rest or give rest. At the 
time of the Poona Congress, in spite of the fact that 
Mr. Tilak had repeatedly declared through the Kesari 
and in the meetings of the working committee that 
the question of the loan of the Congress pavilion for 
the Social Conference should be decided by either Re- 
ception Committee or by the Congress itself, the cry 
was kept up that Mr. Tilak was an extremely narrow- 
minded and quarrelsome man and that he did not want 
the Social Conference to be held in the Congress pavilion. 
It is, after all, best to throw a pall over all these exhi- 
bitions of the good taste, decency and fair-play of his 
opponents ; but a Uttle peep into them is necessary in 
order to understand the stupendous difficulties through 
and inspite of which Mr. Tilak single-handed had to 
deliver his message to the people. 



366 LOKAMANVA TILAK 

Nor were the Reformers and the Moderates the only 
opponents Mr. Tilak had to reckon. There was a 
powerful section of the Bureaucracy and its proteges 
of the Anglo-Indian Press whose hostility so 
often has proved a fruitful source of trouble to Mr. 
Tilak. The success of the New English School had 
given a headache to the Times of India, and in the esta- 
blishment of an innocent school patronized by men 
like Ranade, Telang and Mandlik, it foresaw unpleasant 
results. The tone of the Kesari and the Mahratta was 
regarded as unfriendly to their interests by the Govern- 
ment. When in 1890, Mr. Tilak took an attitude of 
opposition to the Age of Consent Bill, the Times of India 
inquired how it was that such a man could be or remain 
a member of an institution like the Deccan Education 
Society ; and then with a sigh of relief and a chuckling 
sense of satisfaction, Principal Apte wrote a rejoinder 
declaring that Mr. Tilak was no longer a member of the 
Society. Three years rolled on, years in which Mr. 
Tilak was bringing upon himself the wrath of vested 
interests. Then came the Hindu-Mahomedan riots ; 
the sky was thick with the dust of controversies ; and 
Mr. Tilak, without mincing matters, again and again 
declared that the policy of favouritism inaugurated by 
a certain section of the Bureaucracy was responsible 
for all the mischief that was going on for well-nigh two 
years. This was bearding the lion, rudely and un- 
ceremoniously. How boldly and uncompromisingly 
Mr. Tilak expressed his views on this ' Divide and Rule ' 
poUcy can be appreciated only by a study of all the 
soft speeches of the so-called leaders of those times. 
Even the late Sir Pherozeshah, Tribune of the people 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 367 

that he was, gave utterance to the right view m the 
mildest and most guarded language. If ever a leader 
deUvered his message through storm and stress, thun- 
der and lightening, obloquy and persecutions, it was 
Mr. Tilak ; and delivered under such circumstances, it 
derived a meaning, it commanded a respect which 
otherwise mere abilities or learning would not have 
brought it. It is only the man who swims against the 
current and not the one who swims with it, who deser- 
ves praise ; and Mr. Tilak lived to gain this due. 

In the earlier years of his career, Mr. Tilak's pubUc 
activities were regarded as merely destructive by those 
whose influence and methods he had challenged. Let 
us see what Mr. Tilak did during the fifteen years since 
he measured swords with Ranade and Telang. He car- 
ried the message of the Congress to the smallest and 
most distant hamlet in Maharashtra ; he spread broad- 
cast the teachings of Western liberalism, of Western 
democracy. He opened the eyes of the people to their 
terrible condition — stark poverty and utter bondage. 
He held before their eyes the vision of the great ideal, — 
Swaraj. He called upon them to work hard and sacri- 
fice their very best. He told them not to be deluded 
by the words of the so-called Reformers who never 
tired of calling them weak. He accustomed them to 
look back to the past and draw therefrom inspiration 
for the work of the present. He taught them to watch 
the administration of the day with vigilance. He 
trained them up in organised opposition. He showed 
them by personal example how to suffer for one's con- 
victions and one's country. If all this be destructive 
work, Mr. Tilak loses nothingby being called a " destruc- 



368 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

tive force." Only one should like to know what 
" constructive " work means. 

When the pantalooned orators of the National Con- 
gress were in vain making passionate appeals to the 
Government, Mr. Tilak had already pinned his faith on 
the people. His gospel of Swaraj formed a refreshing 
contrast to the petty demands formulated from time to 
time by the National Congress. No doubt the festival 
of Shivaji was a provoincial affair wherein only the 
Hindus could participate. Still it did greater national 
service in Maharashtra during the nineties than the 
Congress itself. The methods of the national body 
were outlandish and hence ineffective, uninspiring and 
unpopular. The Congress stood for the glorification 
of the British Rule, while the Shivaji festival took the 
peoples' minds back to that period when the slogan of 
Swaraj was reverberating throughout the length and 
breadth of the land. This powerful appeal to a glori- 
ous past, together with the lessons of courage and self- 
sacrifice which it inculcated did in those days greater 
service to Western India than the National Congress. 
Owing to its inherent limitations, the Shivaji festival 
could not, of course, usurp the functions of the Congress 
even in Maharashtra. The festival, however, stands 
as a symbol of Mr. Tilak's methods of awakening and 
organizing the people and did exceptionally valuable 
political work supplementary to that of the Congress. 

Mr. Tilak's strenuous efforts to awaken the people 
together with the organized opposition he led in the 
famine and plague agitations excited the liveliest ap- 
prehension in the minds of some ofiicials and a moment of 
panic was seized upon to put him down. The prosecu- 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 369 

tion of Mr. Tilak in 1897 was the first serious attempt 
of the Bureaucracy to secure the silence of a " trouble- 
some " agitator. So weak were the traditions of our 
pubhc life, that Mr. Tilak's persistence in braving the 
ire of an inflamed officialdom was regarded almost as 
an act of madness and great pressure was brought to 
induce him to apologize. A similar attempt made 
(i892)tosave a Calcutta newspaper from the operations 
of 124A by a belated apology had been criticized by Mr. 
Tilak and he was not a man to set up one standard of 
conduct for others and quite another for himself. He 
cheerfully went to gaol rather than bend his knee before 
the powers that be. The terrors of gaol could not 
cow him down, nor did the actual prison -Ufe with its 
nauseating food and fatiguing work. Though he came 
out of the portals of the Yeravda gaol a broken man, 
his spirit was as unbending as ever and after a few 
months of rest and recuperation, he took up the threads 
of his public activities, unhampered by the reactionary 
regime of Lord Curzon, imdeterred by the machinations 
of his enemies in the Tai Maharaj Case. 

A great man never suffers without gaining in spiritual 
strength ; and the sufferings of Mr. Tilak in the Tai 
Maharaj case were proverbial. In the earlier stages of 
this case, there were occasions when Mr. Tilak's clouds 
were unredeemed by any " silver lining ', when expres- 
sions of hope would have sounded as nothing but 
*' hollow mockery or premature consolations," But 
he refused to be disheartened by the manifold odds 
against him. The mighty resources of a prejudiced 
Bureaucracy, coupled with the endless scheming of 
unscrupulous enemies failed to shake his faith in the 

24: 



370 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

justice and invincibility of his cause. Even when he 
was sentenced to imprisonment on a charge of perjury, 
handcuffed hke a common felon and sent to jail, cheer- 
fulness and equanimity never left him. 

To all appearances, Mr. Tilak, when he emerged {1904) 
triumphant out of the first stage of the Tai Maharaj 
case, was the same man,a bit worried and dis- 
tracted, who was drawn into its vortex in 1900. But a 
subtle spiritual change had come over him which en- 
hanced his prestige and power in the anti-Partition 
agitation of which he was to be one of the foremost 
leaders. Prior to 1904, Mr. Tilak's speeches and wri- 
tings were merely intellectual. There was of course a 
"background of spiritualit}/ which we notice in his career 
since the very beginning. But the personality was 
pronouncedly intellectual. His speeches and writings 
arrested attention, extorted admiration and roused 
enthusiasm by the ruthless logic of a trained intellec- 
tual gladiator ; but there was no consciousness of Faith 
in Divine guidance in them. The veritable ordeal of 
the Tai Maharaj Case, however, immensely contributed 
to his spiritual growth. From a patriot, he was now 
transformed into a prophet. 

While the fortunes of Mr. Tilak were apparently in 
the melting pot, his supposed rival, the Hon. Mr. 
Gokhale was rising from one pinnacle of glory to another. 
The careers of these two great Mahratta Brahmins 
suggest a series of interesting reflections. Both started 
life as school-masters. Both dedicated their all to the 
service of the Motherland. Both took to public life in 
true missionary spirit. Both were distinguished educa- 
tionists, professors of a very high order ; — Mr. Gokhale, 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 37I 

studious, copious and methodical, Mr. Tilak, versatile, 
profound and original. Both took to journalism in 
the early nineties. Mr. Tilak remained an editor till 
the end of his life. Mr. Gokhale gave up journalism 
after less than half a dozen years' apprenticeship, labour- 
ed at Statistics and became an enthusiastic student of 
Economics and Politics. Mr. Gokhale's training and 
equipment led him to the Councils and he attained re- 
putation as the first Councillor in India. Mr. Tilak 
devoted his energy to the cause of journaUsm and 
became the premier editor in the country. Mr. Gokhale 
came to be a great favourite with the Moderate leaders. 
Mr. Tilak founded a new school of poHtical thought of 
ivhich he was the undisputed and most influential 
leader. Mr. Gokhale's politics and opportunities made 
him a persona grata with the Indian Bureaucracy and 
the English poUticians. Mr. Tilak's methods or fate 
led him into bitter opposition with the Bureaucracy 
and landed him into trouble and jail. Mr. Gokhale's 
path was swept clean even by highly-placed officials. 
Mr. Tilak's course, on the contrary, was often rendered 
thorny by Bureaucratic ire. Mr. Gokhale's mis- 
sion in life was to be the awakener of the Bureaucratic 
conscience; Mr. Tilak's was to rouse the soul of 
his countrymen. 

Till the end of his brilliant career, Mr.Gokhale:could 
never overcome the struggle between his inborn enthu- 
siasm and innate caution. His enthusiasm landed him 
into difficulties from which his caution hardly extricated 
him ; on the contrary, his caution sometimes got the 
better of his enthusiasm and made him take positions, 
his better nature would never have allowed him to do. 



372 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

He lacked personality and forcefulness. The influence 
of a strong-willed colleague was often responsible for 
his inconsistencies. Then we must not forget the dizzy 
height which he had ascended. Courted by Cabi- 
net Ministers, trusted and flattered by the Bureaucracy^ 
Mr. Gokhale was in a pecuHar position during the event- 
ful years of the anti-Partition movement. His own 
enthusiasm drew him in one direction, his Moderate as- 
sociates to another, while the English and Anglo-In- 
dian officials pulled him quite in a contrary direction ; 
and Mr. Gokhale's politics reveals the evident struggle 
to keep his balance between these contending forces. 

With Mr. Tilak the case was different. As he never 
aspired to win the applause at once of the populace, of 
the Beuraucracy and the ministers at ' home ', his line 
of conduct during the eventful years just preceding his 
last and longest incarceration was uniformly consistent. 
There are those who sneer at his alliance with the Bengal 
* Extremists *, which, they argue, led him to adopt 
measures and preach opinions, which, left to himself, 
he would never have done. One may reply this criti- 
cism by counter- criticism. The Moderates of Bengal 
and the Moderates of Bombay had a world of difference 
between them and though the Moderate leaders of 
Bombay had not the courage to oppose the resolution 
on National Education at Calcutta (Dec. 1906), still 
they did not hesitate to oppose that same resolution in 
the next Provincial Conference at Surat (May 1907). 
Is not this inconsistency ? When the Congress had 
passed resolutions on Swadeshi and Boycott, when the 
Hon. Mr. Gokhale himself was warmly advocating the 
cause of Bengal and the strong measures adopted there to 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 373 

give a home-thrust to our callous rulers, Congressmen 
and Moderate newspapers were found to ridicule, 'Honest 
Swadeshi ' and ' economic boycott '. The circumstan- 
ces of Bengal were such that it was impossible for the 
harassed, persecuted and well-nigh desperate Ben- 
galis to believe in the advent of a day when Britain 
would make us their equal partners. Naturally the 
Bengalis began to look to independence as their ulti- 
mate ideal, an ideal, be it remembered, which the Indian 
law-courts and the then Secretary of State found nothing 
to find fault with. Was it Mr. Tilak's fault that when 
some of his Indian and Anglo-Indian opponents began 
to stamp the ideal of independence as illegal, he rushed 
to the rescue of his Bengali friends ? Did not Sir 
Surendranath himself allow an amendment to the 
Self- Government Resolution at the Pubna Conference 
(1908) wherein, the Nationalists did affirm their faith 
in independence as the ultimate goal to be achieved ? 
So the ' inconsistency ' of Mr. Tilak amounts to this, 
that knowing Maharashtra to be not quite ready for 
this higher ideal, he preached in Western India "Colonial 
Self-Go vernment " as the political ideal, though in 
view of certain mischievous attacks, he felt bound to 
draw the sword in defence of the theoretically perfect 
ideal of independence. 

The one work, which Mr. Tilak set himself to do 
with his phenomenal energies, was to rouse the moral 
and intellectual courage of the people. Where, as in 
Bengal, circumstances considerably helped the process of 
this awakening, he did his best to prevent it from dis- 
aster by a reckless extravagance which defeats its own 
^nd. To rouse the latent moral and intellectual nature 



374 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

of the people is comparatively easy ; to divert it in. 
constructive channels is difficult ; there the vested 
interests, so firmly established try their best to knock 
down every effort at organization. In the initial stages,. 
infant democracy has to fight not only with the 
rulers of the land, but also with the intellectual, 
industrial and other magnates in the country. Tt is in 
fact a struggle between those who are supposed to 
have a stake in the land and those who have not. Is 
it wonderful that this unholy alliance between money. 
Government and intelligence should succeed, though 
for a time, in crushing the leaders of the proletariat ? 
The struggle at Surat was really a fight between the 
old aristocracy on the one hand and the infant demo- 
cracy on the other; and looking to the vastness of 
the issues involved, it is but natural that matters 
thus came to a crisis. 

The dazzling splendour of Mr. Tilak's activities 
after the Surat breach shows how an accomplished 
leader can defy a tacit alliance between the old aristocracy 
and the alien Bureaucracy. But it is humanly impossi- 
ble for any leader to guarantee perfect peace in the rank 
and file when the tyranny of the Government inflames 
people beyond measure. The bomb-thrower at Muzaf- 
ferpore was out, not only to harm the Govern- 
ment but the Nationalist party as well ; and he created 
the same muddle in Indian politics which Shakes- 
peare's Puck in the Midsummer Nights Dream did 
in the even course of love between two young men 
and women. Mr. Tilak knew full well that a strong 
effort would be made to sweep his movement out. He, 
therefore, called his principal colleagues in Western 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 375 

India, and issued a statement deploring the outrages 
and suggesting ways and means for their prevention. 
But the Bureaucracy was apparently bent on put- 
ting down the Nationalists. Mr. Tilak was arrested 
and within a month was sent away to Ahmedabad 
and Mandalay ; he got an opportunity, however, to 
declare in solemn tones a warning that repression, 
though temporarily successful, would only strengthen 
the cause he was fighting for. 

And he proved a true prophet ; while he was at 
Mandalay, alternating his time between Religion, 
Philosophy, History and Mathematics, the surviving 
party of the Moderates tried its best to take full 
advantage of the Morley-Minto Reforms, as also of 
the inactivity of its opponents. But it quickly realized 
the truth, Mr. Tilak had repeatedly uttered that 
the Moderate could expect a little favour only when 
the Extremist was in the field. The Moderates were 
quickly disillusioned and were ready to ask for an- 
other 'boon '; the Moslems, who had accustomed them 
selves to be considered as the special favourites of Go- 
vernment, had been exasperated by the attitude of 
England in the Turko-Balkan and the Turko-ItaJian 
wars. Even Mrs. Besant, hitherto somewhat indiffer- 
ent to Indian politics, had taken a plunge into the 
arena of our public life. 

It speaks much for Mr. Tilak's elasticity of mind 
that soon after his return (1914) from Mandalay he 
took in the situation almost at a glance. Being 
always accustomed to place his country's interests 
above everything else, he was prepared to forget and 
forgive not only his Moderate opponents but even the 
incorrigible Bureaucrats. To placate the Moderates 
and the Government he made a declaration of his 
loyalty, — a declaration which created hopes in the 
mind of Mrs. Besant of Congress compromise. The 
outbreak of War found him a staunch ally of the 
Government. He offered any kind of help he could. 
But neither the autocrats of the Congress nor those 
in the Government were willing to grasp the outstret- 
ched hand of friendship. ^ 

The events of the last six years and Mr. Tilak's 
glorious part therein are too fresh in the reader's 
mind to need any reiteration. These crowded years 
of public Hfe form the noblest page of Mr. Tilak's 
life. It is a period when he emerges triumphant | 

3ver his opponents. It is a time when we see him, 
not, as in 1889-1905 — a brave soldier, hopelessly 
fighting against tremendous odds, not, as in 1905-1908, 
a party leader tr3dng to force his way through co- 
lumns of opposition, but an all—India leader, a tact- 
ful negotiator, a skilled diplomat, a far-seeing states- 
man, an all-wise prophet. We see the constructive 
side of his work in all its splendour. We see him 
brave as yore, assertive as before, but with a meUow 
splendour which refined and softened the sternness of 
his dominating personality. 

Such a leadership is the accident of a century ! 
How lucky for India then, that no sooner did the 
Lokamanya expire, than his place has been cons- 
picuously filled up by Mahatma Gandhi, whose 
unapproachable sanctity has raised politics to the 
height of rehgion. The leadership of the Lokamanya 
was pronouncedly intellectual and that of the 



GENERAL REFLECTIONS 377 

Mahatma is essentially spiritual. In both, however, 
there is an element of grandeur which reminds us of 
the following memorable words of another equally great 
patriot, Arabindo Ghose : 

I am the lord of the tempest and the mountain, 
I am the spirit of freedom and pride, 
Stark he must be a Kinsman to danger 
Who shares my kingdom and walks by my side. 



## THE ORION 

( Appendix A and B will give the reader an idea of 
the principal arguments advanced by Mr. Tilak 
in the Orion and the Arctic Home in the Vedas to 
establish his theories. The Gita-Rahasya being com- 
paratively a recent production is too well-known 
to require any summary. ) 

Oriental scholars have advanced vague and uncer- 
tain conjectures about the age and character of the 
Vedas. Prof. Max MuUer has divided the Vedic liter- 
ature into four arbitrary periods, the Chhandas, Mantra, 
Brahmana and Sutra and by assigning two hundred 
years for each period he arrives at about 1200 B.C. 
as the latest date at which the Vedic hymns have been 
composed. As opposed to this linguistic method of 
ascertaining the age of the Vedas, there is the astronomi- 
cal method which though condemned by European 
scholars as inaccurate and conjectural, can, if properly 
applied, lead us to good results. The Vedas, the Brah- 
manas and the Sutras contain numerous allusions and 
references to astronomical facts. There are several 
sacrificial hymns in the Rig-veda. Now, no sacrificial 
system could be developed without the knowledge of 
months, seasons and the year. It appears that 
the Vedic Rishis kept up their calender by perform- 
ing the corresponding round of sacrifices on the 



APPENDIX A 379 

sacred fire that constantly burnt in their houses ; and 
as they were not only the sacrificers of the community 
but were also its time-keepers, these two functions 
appear to have blended into one by assigning the com- 
mencement of the several sacrifices to the leading days 
of the year on the natural ground that if the sacrifices 
were to be performed, they must be performed on the 
principal days of the year. Samvatsara and Yajna 
therefore came to be regarded as convertible terms. 

Let us now examine the principal parts of the year 
alias the sacrifice. The Savana or the civil day, as its 
etymology shows, was selected as the natural unit of 
time. 30 such days made a month and 12 such months 
or 360 Savana days made a year. Now, a month of 30 
civil or savana days cannot correspond with a lunar 
synodical month and so a day in some of the Savana 
months was required to be omitted to secure the con- 
currence of the civil and lunar months. The year of 
360 Savana days was thus practically reduced to a 
lunar year of 354 civil days or 360 tithis. But a further 
correction was necessary to adjust the lunar with the 
solar reckoning of time. The commencement of the 
cycle of the seasons was, therefore, the only means to 
correct the calender and the ancient Aryans hit upon 
the device of the intercalary days or month for the 
purpose. 

It appears that the early Vedic priests were ignorant 
of the motion of the equinoxes. The early Aryans must 
have determined the position of the sun in the 
ecliptic by observing, every morning, the fixed 
star nearest to it. Under such system, the year 
would naturally be over when the sun returned to the 



3 So LOKAMANYA TILAK 

same fixed star. The solar year, therefore, mentioned 
in the Vedic works, must be considered as sidereal and 
not tropical. The difference between the sidereal and 
the tropical year is 20.4 minutes which causes the 
seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about 
every two thousand years. When these changes came to 
be noticed for the first time they caused surprise and 
were regarded as foretelling some great calamity. 

Another important point, relevent to our purpose is 
when the year commenced. The Vedanga-Jyotish 
makes the year (and Uttarayana) commence with the 
winter- solstice. But a closer examination shows that 
the winter-solstice could not have been the original 
beginning of the annual sacrifices (and therefore of the 
year). The middle day of the annual Satra is called 
the Vishnuvan day and as Vishnuvan literally means 
the time when day and night are of equal length, if we 
suppose the year to have commenced with the winter 
solstice, the Vishnuvan or the equinoctial day could 
never have been its central day. If Vishnuvan was 
the central day of the year, the year must have once 
commenced with the equinoxes. We may, therefore, 
take Uttarayana to mean " the passage of the sun into 
the northern hemisphere, i.e., to the north of the 
equator ; and thus we can say that the Uttarayana and 
the year must have commenced with the Vernal equinox. 
While describing the Devayana and Pitriyana, the 
Shatapatha Brahmana (ii-i-3-3). lays it down in dis- 
tinct terms that Vasanta, Grishma and Varsha were 
the seasons of the Devas. It is impossible therefore 
to maintain that the Devayana or the Uttarayana 
-ever commenced with the winter-solstice, for in 



APPENDIX A 381 

neither hemisphere the winter-solstice marks the 
beginning of the spring, the first of the Deva sea- 
sons. It is difhcult to definitely ascertain the 
time when the commencement of the year was changed 
from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice. When 
this change was made, Uttarayana must have gradually 
come to denote the first half of the new year, i.e., the 
period from the winter to the summer solstice especially 
as the word was capable of being understood as " turn- 
ing towards the North from the Southern- most point.*^ 
All our present calenders are prepared on the sup- 
position that the Vernal equinox still coincides with the 
end of Revati and our enumeration of the Nakshatras 
begins with Ashvini, though the equinox has now re- 
ceded about 18° from Revati. This position of the 
Vernal equinox was true at about 490 A.D. when 
probably the present system was introduced. Let us 
now see if we can trace back the position of the Vernal 
equinox amongst the fixed circle of stars. From Vara- 
hamihira, we know that before the Hindus began to 
make their measurements from the Vernal equinox in Re- 
vati, there existed a system in which the year commenced 
with the winter solstice in the month of Magha and the 
Vernal equinox was in the last quarter of Bharani or the 
beginning of the Krittikas. TheVedanga- Jyotish, the old- 
est astronomical work in Sanskrit, gives the follow- 
ing positions of the solstice and the equinoxes : — 

(i) The winter solstice in the beginning of Shra- 
vishtha (divisional). 

(2) The Vernal equinox in 10° of Bharani. 

(3) The summer solstice in the middle of Ashlesha, 

(4) The autumnal equinox in 3° 20' of Vishakha. 



382 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

From these data, astronomers have calculated that 
the solstitial colure occupied the above position be- 
tween 1269 B.C. to 1181 B.C. There are many passages 
in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Taittiriya Brahmana 
where the Krittikas occupy the first place in the list of 
the Nakshatras. We must, therefore, presume that 
the Vernal equinox coincided with the Krittikas when 
the Taittiriya vSamhita was compiled. The Taittiriya 
Brahmana (i 5, 2, 7) says that the Nakshatras are the 
houses of Gods and that the Nakshatras of the Devas 
begin with the Krittikas. The Shatapatha Brahmana 
expressly states that the Sun was to be considered as 
moving amongst and protecting the Devas, when he 
turned to the North, in the three seasons, of spring, sum- 
mer and rains. This, therefore, at once fixes the posi- 
tion of the Krittikas at the beginning of the Devayana 
or the vernal equinox at the time when these works 
were compiled. The Taittiriya Samhita expressly states 
that the winter solstice fell in Magha. From all these, 
we conclude that the Krittikas coincided with the Ver- 
nal equinox when the Taittiriya Samhita was compiled 
{2350 B.C.) 

The passage in the Taittiriya Samhita which states 
that the winter solstice fell in Magha also refers to the 
Phalguni full-moon and the Chitra full-moon as the 
first days of the year. Now as evidently there can't 
be real beginnings of the year at an interval of one 
month each, the passage must be understood as re- 
cording a tradition about these two full-moon days 
being once considered as the first days of the year. If 
the year commenced with winter solstice with the 
Phalguni full-moon, the Vernal equinox must have been 



APPENDIX A 383 

in the Mrigashiras (Orion) The word Agrhaayani (Syn. 
for Mrigashiras), suggests the same tale. With the Vernal 
equinox near the asterism of Mrigashiras, the autumnal 
equinox would be in Mula which was so called because 
its acronycal rising marked the commencement of the 
year. Again with the winter solstice occuring on the 
Phalguni full-moon day, the summer solstice fell on 
the Bhadrapadi full moon so that the dark half of 
Bhadrapada was the first fortnight in the Pitriyana, 
understood as commencing on the summer solstice. 
On no other hypothesis can the dedication of the dark 
half of Bhadrapada to the Pitris be satisfactorily ex- 
plained. 

When the Vernal equinox was in Orion it was the 
beginning of the Devayana and as the constellation is 
remarkable for its brilliancy and attractiveness, the 
ancient Aryans may have been naturally influenced not 
merely to connect their old traditions with it but also 
to develop them on the same lines. Thus the Devayana 
and the Pitriyana, as representing the two hemispheres 
must be joined and the Vernal and the autumnal equi- 
noxes became the natural points of union between the 
regions of Gods and Yama. The equinoxes were in fact 
the gates, of heaven and as such it was natural to sup- 
pose that they were watched by dogs (Canis Major 
and Canis Miror). In the later Indian literature we are 
told that the souls of the deceased have to cross a stream 
before they reach the region of Yama which we can 
easily identify with the Milky W^ay which could then 
have been appropriately described as separating the 
regions of Gods and Yama, the Devayana and the Pritri- 
yana or the Northern and the Southern hemisphere. 



384 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Later, it is actually called the celestial river and we are 
further told that the land of the blessed is to be reached 
by " the celestial ship with a good rudder." We can 
satisfactorily account for these legends by supposing 
that the Vernal equinox was near the Dog-star in those 
days just near the Milky Way, 

There is another set of traditions which can be simi- 
larly explained on the supposition with which we have 
started, viz., the Vernal equinox was then in Orion. The 
heliacal rising of the constellation at the beginning of 
the year marked the revival of nature at the commence- 
ment of spring and the asterism may thus be said to 
represent all these milder influences which in later 
mythology were fully embodied in the conception of 
Vishnu. But the case was completely reversed if we 
take the acronycal rising of the same. It was at the 
autumnal equinox that the Dog-star rose at the begin- 
ning of night and though strictly speaking it marked 
the end of Varsha,yet the portion of the heaven wherein 
the constellation is situated could have been easily re- 
garded as the battle-ground of Indra and Vritra, who 
fought in those days and also as the stage on which the 
terrible Rudra made his appearance. On this same 
hypothesis we can explain how Vritra came to be sta- 
tioned at the gates of hell. Indra cut oH the head of Vritra 
or Namuchi in the form of a Mriga and this at once sug- 
gests whether that head is not the same as that of 
Prajapati cut off by Rudra (Ardra or Sirius). The 
foamy weapon with which Indra killed Namuchi is noth- 
ing but a reference tot he Milky Way, The attributes of 
Rudra, chasing of the antelope, his bearing of the Ganges 
in his matted hair and fondness for the burning ground 



APPENDIX A 385 

and appearance as a Kirata or hunter — all these can be 
accounted for by placing Rudra just below the Milky 
Way or the celestial Ganges at the gates of the Pitriyana 
and figured as a hunter. In Rig. X 192-2, Samvatsara 
or the year is said to rise out of the ocean, the place 
where Vritra was killed (Rig. X 68-12). Prajapati as 
represented by Orion may also be naturally supposed 
to commence the year when the Vernal equinox was in 
Orion. Rudra killed Prajapati (or Samavatsara or 
Yajna) at the beginning of the year and as Yajna also 
meant sacrifice, Rudra was later believed to have killed 
the sacrifice of Daksha. So then Vishnu, representing 
the happy times of Vasanta, Rudra presiding over 
storms and Prajapati, the deity of sacrifices — these 
three principal deities of the Hindu Mythology can be 
traced to and located in the part of heaven occupied by 
Orion when the Vernal equinox was there. Later 
writers have described this Trinity as represented by the 
three-headed Dattatraya, followed by the Vedas in the 
forms of dogs, and from what has been written above, 
there can be no diificulty in identifying this personified 
Trinity with Orion having three stars in the head and 
closely followed by the dog (canis) at its foot. 

These and other traditions especially those of Ribhus 
and Vrishakapi strengthen the hypothesis of the tradi- 
tional year-beginning on the Phalguni full moon. With 
the Phalguni full moon at the winter solstice, the Vernal 
equinox was in Mrigashiras ; so with the Chitra full 
moon at the solstice, the Vernal equinox would be in 
Punarvasu. The presiding deity of Punarvasu is 
Aditi and we are told that Aditi had been blessed with 
a boon that all sacrifices must commence and end with 
25 



386 LOKAMANVA TILAK 

her (Aitareya Brahmana 1-7 and the Taittiriya Samhita 
vi 1-5-1,). The story begins with the statement that 
the Sacrifice (the mysterious Sacrificial personage) went 
away from the Gods. The Gods were then unable to 
perform any further ceremonies, and did not know 
where it (the sacrifice) had gone to ; and it was Aditi 
that helped them in this state, to find out the proper 
commencement of the sacrifice. This clearly means 
that before this time sacrifices were performed at ran- 
dom, but it was at this time resolved and fixed to com- 
mence them from Aditi. Aditi was thus the oldest and 
rst commencement of the sacrifice or the year. In 
the Vajasaneyi Samhita 4-19 Aditi is said to be Ubha- 
yatah Shirshni " double-headed " and the commenta- 
tors interpret it to mean that the two termini of the 
sacrifice which began and ended with Aditi, are the 
two heads here alluded to. These traditions are further 
corroborated by the sacrificial ceremonies. According 
to the sacrificial terminology, the 4th day before Vishnu- 
van or the central day of the yearly Satra is called the 
Abhijit day. Now if Abhijit day be supposed to be 
named after the Nakshtra of that name (i.e. when the 
Sun is in Abhijit) then the Vishnu van or the autumnal 
equinox must fall four days after the asterism 
of Abhijit ; and it can be shown by astronomical calcu- 
lation that with Aditi or Punarvasu at the Vernal 
equinox to commence the sacrifice, we nearly get at 
the same result. 

Therefore, the oldest period in the Aryan civilisation 
may be called the Aditi or the pre-Orion period and we 
may roughly assign 6000 — 4000 B.C. as its limits. 
Then there was the Orion period roughly extending 



APPENDIX A 387 

■from 4000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. from the time when the 
Vernal equinox was in the asterism of Ardra to the 
time when it receded to the asterism of the Krittkias. 
The third or the Krittika period commences with the 
Vernal equinox in the asterism of the Krittikas and 
•extends up to the period recorded in the Vedanga- 
Jyotisha, i.e., 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C. and the fourth and 
last period of the old Sanskrit literature extends from 
1400 B.C. to 500 B.C. or to the birth and rise of Bud- 
dhism which may be called the real-Pre Buddhistic 
period. It will thus be found that the antiquities of 
the Vedas can be traced up to a far remoter time than 
what Max Muller and other European scholars were 
wilUng to assign. 



## Arctic Home 



Up to the middle of the igth century, myths and 
traditions were the only materials available for the 
study of pre-historic man. So various attempts were 
made to systematise these myths and explain them ra- 
tionally. But the mythologists carried on their re- 
searches at a time when man was beHeved to be post- 
glacial and when the physical and geographical sur- 
roundings of the ancient man were assumed not to have 
been materially different from those of the present day. 
But about the middle of the igth century, from hund- 
reds of stone and bronze implements found buried in 
various places in Europe, the archaeologists established 
the chronological sequence of the Iron, the Bronze and 
the Stone age in times preceding the historic period and 
discovered evidence to prove the existence of the Gla- 
cial period at the close of the Quarternary era and the 
high antiquity of man who was shown to have lived not 
only throughout the Quarternary but also in the Ter- 
tiary era when the climatic conditions of the globe were 
quite different from those in the present or Post-Glacial 
period. It, therefore, became evident that the results 
previously arrived at by philologists and mythologists 
must be revised in the hght of new scientific discoveries. 
It also became necessary to study the ancient 
sacred books of the Aryans in the light of modern 



APPENDIX B 389 

archaeological and geological discoveries ; for if 
man existed before the last Glacial period and witness- 
ed the gigantic change which brought on the Ice 
age, it is not unnatural to expect that a reference, howso 
ever concealed and distant, to these events would be found 
in the oldest traditionary beliefs and memories of man- 
kind. If we read some of the passages in the Vedas, 
which have hitherto been considered incomprehensible, 
in the light of the new scientific discoveries, we arc 
forced to the conclusion that the home of the ancestors 
of the Vedic people was somewhere near the North 
Pole before the last Glacial epoch. 

Before proceeding to discuss the Vedic texts which 
point to a Polar Home, it is necessary to briefly state 
the results of recent discoveries in archaeology, geology 
and palaeontology. Human races of earlier times have 
left ample evidence of their existence on the surface of 
this globe. It consists of hundreds and thousands of 
rude or polished instruments of stone and metal, recent- 
ly dug out from old camps, fortifications, burial-grounds, 
temples etc. Archaeologists have come to the conclu- 
sion that these implements can be classified into those 
of stone, those of bronze and those of iron, representing 
three different stages of civilisation in the progress of 
man in pre-historic times. Of these three different ages, 
the oldest or the Stone age is further divided into the 
PalaeoUthic and the Neolithic period or the old and the 
new Stone age. 

The Geologist takes up the history of the earth at the 
point where the archaeologist leaves it and carries it 
further back into antiquity. From an examination cf 
the stratified rocks, according to the character of the 



39® LOKAMANYA TIL4K 

fossils found in them, the geologist has divided the 
history of our planet into five different periods. 

The Iron age, the Bronze age and the Neolothic age 
come under the Recent or the Post-Glacial period while 
the Palaeolithic age is supposed to fall in the Pleisto- 
cene period. Various estimates have been made re- 
garding the time of the commencement of the Neolithic 
age but the oldest date assigned does not exceed 5000 
B.C. Regarding the commencement of the Palaeolo- 
thic period, there are two different views entertained 
by the geologists, Prof. Geikie putting it between 50 to 
60 thousand years ago and the American geologists at 
about 8000 years only. 

As regards the races which inhabited Europe in these 
early ages, the evidence furnished by human remains or 
skulls shows that they were the direct ancestors of the 
races now living in the different parts of Europe. The 
question, whether the Aryans were autochthonous or 
went to Europe from some other place cannot be settled 
by these discoveries. But the Vedic and Avestic evidence 
proves that the Aryans were autochthonous neither in 
Europe nor in Central Asia but had their original home 
somewhere near the North Pole in the Palaeolithic 
times and that they migrated from this place south- 
wards in Asia and Europe, not by any " irresisti- 
ble impulse " but by unwelcome changes in the climatic 
conditions of their original home. From the geological 
evidence of fossil, fauna and flora, we find that in the 
early geological ages when the Alps were low and the 
Himalayas not yet upheaved and when Asia and Africa 
were represented by only a group of islands, an 
equable and uniform climate prevailed over the 



APPENDIX B 391 

whole surface of the globe. A luxuriant forest 
vegetation, which can only grow and exist at present 
in the tropical or temperate clirpate, flourished in 
the high altitude of Spitzbergen, where the sun goes 
below the horizon from November till March, thus 
showing that a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic 
regions in those days. If, therefore, the Vedic evidence 
points to an Arctic Home where the ancestors of the 
Vedic Rishis lived in ancient times, there is nothing 
in the latest scientific discoveries which would 
warrant us in considering this result as a priori impro- 
bable. 

It has been a fashion to speak of the Polar regions as 
characterised by light and darkness of six months each ; 
but this statement is only roughly true. The Pole is 
merely a point and aU the inhabitants of the original 
ancient Home, if there was one near the North Pole, 
could not have lived precisely at this single point. We 
must, therefore, distinguish between the characterestics 
of the Polar region and those of the circum-polar region. 

THE POLAR CHARACTERESTICS. 

(i) The Sun rises in the South. 

(2) The stars do not rise and set ; but revolve or spin 
round and round, in horizontal planes, completing one 
round in 24 hours. 

(3) The year consists only of one long day and one 
long night of six months each, 

(4) There is only one morning and one evening. But 
the twilight, whether of the morning or of the evening, 
lasts continuously for about two months. The ruddy 
light of the morn or the evening twilight moves round 
and round along the horizon, like a potter's wheel. 



392 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

THE CIRCUM-POLAR CHARACTERESTICS. 

(i) The Sun will always be to the South of the Zenith 
of the observer. 

(2) A large number of stars are circum-polar ; the 
rest rise and set, but revolve in more oblique circles. 

(3) The year is made up of three parts : — (a) one long 
continuous night lasting for a period of greater than 24 
hours and less than six months according to the lati- 
tude of the place (h) one long continuous day to match 
ic) a succession of ordinary days and nights during the 
rest of the year, never exceeding a period of 24 hours. 

(4) The dawn, at the close of the long continuous 
night, lasts for several days but its duration and magni- 
iicance is proportionally less than at the North Pole. 
The other dawns will only last for a few hours. 

We can take these differentae as our unerring guides 
in the examination of the Vedic evidence bearing on the 
point at issue . If a Vedic description or tradition dis- 
closes any of the characterestics mentioned above, we 
may safely infer that the tradition is Polar or circum- 
Polar in origin, and the phenomenon, if not actually 
witnessed by the poet, was at least known to him by 
tradition, faithfully handed down from generation to 
generation. Such references in the Vedic literature 
may be divided into two parts : the first comprising 
those passages which directly refer to the long night or 
the long dawn and the second consisting of myths or 
legends which corroborate and indirectly support the 
first. 

We find passages in the Rig-veda (X, 89, 4. II, 15.2. 
IV, 56, 3 X, 89, 2) which compare the motion of the 
heavens to that of a wheel and state that the celestial 



APPENDIX B 393 

Vault is supported as if on an axis. Combining these 
two statements, we may safely infer that the motion 
referred to is such a motion of the celestial hemisphere 
as can be witnessed only by an observer at the North 
Pole. 

Let us now turn to another characterestic of the 
Polar regions viz a day and a night of six months each 
and examine references to this characterestic, reference 
to which is found not only in the Puranas but also in 
astronomical works. Surya-Siddhanta (XII, 67) says 
" At Meru, Gods behold the sun after but a single 
rising during the half of his revolution beginning with 
Aries." Manu describing the divisions of time says 
(I, 67) " A year (human) is a day and a night of the 
gods." In Chapters 163 and 164 of the Vanaparvam 
(Mahabharat), Arjuna's \dsit to mount Meru is described 
in detail and we are therein told " At Meru the sun and 
the moon go round from left to right every day and so 
<io all the stars " Later on, the writer says " The moun- 
tain by its lustre, so overcomes the darkness of night, 
that the night can hardly be distinguished from the 
day." A few verses further, and we find, " The day 
and the night are together equal to a year to the resi- 
dents of the place." Evidently, the writer had a tole- 
rably correct idea of the meteorological and astronomi- 
-cal characterestics of the North Pole. The lustre of the 
mountain is the splendour of the Aurora Borealis visible 
at the North Pole. Passing from the Post Vedic literature 
to the Vedic we find in the Taittiraya Brahmana (III, 9 
22, i) " That which is a year is but a single day of the 
Gods." It is true that the statement, or anything similar 
to it is not found in the Samhita portion of the Rigveda^ 

But there are many other passages which go to corro- 
borate this statement in a remarkable way. 

The long continuous dawn with its revolving splen- 
dours is another characterestic of the North Pole. The 
Vedic poets could not have gone into raptures over the 
short-lived dawn of the tropical or temperate zone. In the 
Aitareya Brahmana IV, 7, a long recitation of not less 
than a thousand verses is to be recited by the Hotri priest 
"when the darkness of the night is about to be relieved 
by the light of the dawn." So there must have been 
in those days, sufficient time between the first appear- 
ance of light and the rise of the sun, to recite the long 
song. Sometimes the recitation ended long before sun- 
rise and in that case other hymns are required to be 
continued, and Apa Stamb requires all the ten 
mandalas of the Rigvedas to be recited if necessary. 
In Rigveda VII. 76 the poet expressly tells us 
that a period of several days elapsed between the first 
appearance of the dawn and the actual rising of the 
sun, and the commentator, Sayana, not under- 
standing how the words " day " can be applied to a 
period of time anterior to sunrise, twists the meaning 
of the " Ahan " and translates it by " splendour." 
Similarly in Rig. II. 28-9 the words bhuyasih ushasah 
avyushtah which literally mean " many dawns have 
not dawned or fully flashed forth " have been a riddle 
to the commentators. These dawns were thirty in 
number (Taittiriya Samhita IV. 3. 11). Sayana, 
unable to account for so many dawns explains that 
though the dawn was one yet by its Yogic powers, it 
assumed these various shapes ! 

When the long duration of the Vedic dawn is once 



APPENDIX B 395 

demonstrated, it astronomically follows that long days 
and long nights existed in those times. Let us, how- 
ever, try to find independent evidence of their existence. 
There are many passages in the Rig- Veda that speak of 
long and ghastly darkness in one form or other. Thus 
in I, 32, 10 Vritra, the traditional enemy of Indra, is 
said to be engulfed in long darkness. In V, 32, 5, Indra 
is described as having placed Shushna, who was anxious 
to fight in " the darkness of the pit." The next verse 
speaks of Sunless (ghastly) darkness. These expres- 
sions lose all their propriety, if the darkness, in which 
the enemies of Indra are said to have flourished, be 
taken to be ordinary darkness of twelve, or at best, of 
twenty-four hours' duration. It was in reality a long 
one. 

In the loth Mandala of the Rig- Veda we have a hymn 
(127) in which Night is invoked to " become easily 
fordable." In the Parishishta, which follows this 
hymn the worshipper addresses the Night " May we 
reach the other side in safety ! May we reach the other 
side in safety." In the Atharva-Veda, XIX, 47, the 
second verse runs thus " Each moving thing finds rest 
in her (Night) whose yonder boundary, is not seen, nor 
that which keeps her separate " In the Taittiriya Sam- 
hita I, 5, 5, 4, we have a similar prayer addressed to 
the Night and a little later I, 5, 7, 5, the Samhita itself 
explains the prayer thus " In old times the Brahmans 
were afraid that it (night) would not dawn." What 
does this signify ? If the night was not unusually long, 
where was the necessity for entertaining any misgivings 
about the coming dawn ?" 

Ill, 55, II literally translated means : — " The twin 

pair (females) make many forms ; of the two one shines 
and the other is dark. Two sisters are they, the dark and 
the bright." We have here a two-fold description of 
the couple (Day and Night). It is called the shining 
and the dark and also is described as possessed of many 
forms. Say ana interprets these forms as different 
colours like black, white etc. This is evidently 
wrong. Are we to suppose that we may have 
sometimes green, violet, yellow or blue days and 
nights ? Again though mpa may lend itself to 
this interpretation, the word used in the above 
verse, Vapumshi cannot be so understood. It 
can only denote the extent, duration and length of days 
and nights, in addition to their colour, which can be 
only twofold, dark or bright. The first half of the 
verse, therefore, means, " The twin pair assume various 
(nana) lengths (Vapumshi) ; of the two one shines and the 
other is dark. The third quarter of the verse " Two 
sisters are they, the dark (Shyavi) and the bright 
(arushi)" has puzzled the commentators but they have 
solved the riddle by regarding the twins (yamya) and 
the sisters (svasaran) as identical. But this is wrong. 
The only possible explanation is that the year spoken 
of in the passage is a circum-PoIar year made up of one 
long day and one long night, forming one pair and a 
number of ordinary days and nights of various lengths 
which can be described as " bright, dark and of varying 
lengths." 

In X, 138, 3, the third verse begins with " The Sun 
unyoked his car in the midst of heaven," not at sunset 
or on the horizon but in the midst of heaven. The 
words are quite clear. Mr. Griffith tries to explain this 



APPENDIX B 397 

difficulty by thinking that the poet here refers to an 
ecUpse. But during an eclipse, the sun is covered with ♦ 
the dark shadow of the earth and is not besides sta- 
tionary. Sayana twists the meaning. But we need 
not be impatient to escape from the natural meaning 
of the verse. A long halt of the sun in the midst of 
the heaven is clearly described here and it refers to the 
long day of the Arctic region. 

In the Samhita and the Brahmanas, the annual 
sattras, or yearly sacrificial sessions, are said to extend 
over twelve months. But this was impossible within 
the Arctic region, where the sun goes below the horizon 
for a number of months during the year, thereby pro- 
ducing the long night. The oldest duration of the 
annual sattras, if such were ever performed within the 
Polar regions, would therefore be shorter than twelve 
months. In other words, an annual sattra of less than 
twelve months would be the chief distinguishing mark 
of the older sacrificial system. As all the people can- 
not be expected to be stationed at the Pole, the months 
of sunshine will vary from seven to eleven for the inha- 
bitants of the Arctic region ; and the Arctic sacrificial 
year, would be made up of these months of sunshine. 
Let us now interpret the legend of Aditi or the seven 
Adityas (Suns). This legend expressly tells us that the 
oldest number of Adityas is seven. The sun is called 
seven horsed and in V, 45, 9 and his seven wheeled 
chariot is said to be drawn by seven bay steeds (I, 50, 8). 
The Atharva-Veda speaks of the " seven bright rays of 
the Sun (VII, 107, i). Sayana is unable to account for 
the number seven as appUed to the rays. The cue to 
understand the legend can be had from Shatapatha 



398 LOKAMANYA TII^K 

Brahmana which says " There are twelve months of 
the year ; these are the Adityas.'* It therefore the 
twelve Adityas represent the twelve months of the year, 
the seven Adityas must have once (purvyam yugam) 
represented the seven months of the year. The legend 
of the Dashagvas or Dirghatamas points to the existence 
of an year of ten months ; and as these cannot be ac- 
counted for except on the Arctic theory, the chain of 
evidence is strengthened by these legends. 

The sacrificial literature also helps us in arriving at 
the same hypothesis. Once in the Aitaraya Brahmana 
and twice in the Taittiriya Samhita, we meet with des- 
criptions regarding the Gavam-Ayanam, or the " cows' 
walk " wherein cows are represented as holding a sacri- 
ficial session. This session could be completed in 10 or 
12 months. Why the session could be completed in 10 
months seems to have puzzled Sayana and others, who 
merely content themselves with remarking that it is 
an " immemorial customs." The Arctic theory throws 
quite a new light on this tradition. Tlie Gavam-ayanam 
of ten months and the old Roman year of ten months 
are relics of the period when the Aryans lived within 
the circumpolar regions. The * cows ' were not really 
cows, but the Adityas (month-gods). 

If we turn to Vedic mythology, we find several stories, 
which cannot be properly explained either on the Dawn 
or Storm theory. The description of Indra's fight with 
Vritra records four simultaneous effects (i) the release 
of the cows (2) the release of the waters (3) the produc- 
tion of the dawn and (4) the production of the 
Sun. Advocates of the Storm theory describe 
Vrita as a storm-cloud and by smiting it with his 



APPENDIX B 399 

thunder- bolt, Indra may be described as releasing the 
waters imprisoned therein. But where are the cows 
which are said to be released along with the waters. 
The Niruktas interpret cows to mean Waters ; but in 
that case the release of the waters and the release of 
the cows are not two distinct effects. 

The struggle between Indra and Vritra is really a 
struggle between the powers of light and darkness. The 
passages where waters are said to be released by Indra 
after kilhng Vritra do not refer expressly to the rain- 
cloud. Vedic scholars have wrongly supposed that when 
the Rig- Veda speaks of the celestial waters (divyah apah) 
only the rain-waters are intended. But this is a mis- 
take ; for in passages which speak of the creation of the 
world (X, 82, 6 ; 129, 3) the world is said to have once 
consisted of nothing but undifferentiated waters, — or 
in the language of modem scientists of ' ether ' or 
* nebulous mass of matter.' The ancient Aryans like 
the old Hebrews believed that the subtle matter which 
filled the whole space in the universe was nothing but 
watery Vapours ; and secondly that the movements of 
the Sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies were 
caused by these Vapours which kept on constantly cir- 
culating from the neither to the upper and from the 
Upper to the lower celestial hemisphere. The mischief 
wrought by Vritra was that he stopped the flow of these 
waters ; consequently the Sun, the moon, the stars all 
ceased to rise. Indra by killing Vritra released the 
waters and brought with them the dawn, the Sun, and 
the cows (i.e., days or the rays of the morning). The 
victory is thus naturally described as four-fold . Ob- 
jectors to this theory might say that the struggle 



400 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

between Indra and Vritra is a daily fight between light 
and darkness. But X, 62, 2 shows that the struggle 
was annual. This proves the Arctic Home hypo- 
thesis. 

The Avesta contains two passages (first two Far-^ 
gards) which also point to this theory. The first 
Fargard (chapter) of the Vendidad enumerates 16 lands 
created by Ahura Mazda. As soon as each land was^ 
created Angra Mainyu, the evil spirit created different 
evils and plagues to invade the land and make it unfit 
for human habitation. Out of these 16 lands 10 can 
be still identified with certainty. This proves that 
the account is real and not mythological. The Airyana 
Vaejo is described as the first good and happy creation 
of Ahura Mazda but Angra Mainyu converted it into 
a land of ten months winter and two months summer. 
This sudden change in the climate of the Airyana Valjo, 
converting ten months summer and two months winter 
into ten months severe winter and two months cold 
summer was clearly due to the advent of the Glacial 
period as established by modern geologists. The 
second Fargard of the Vendidad' gives us a graphic des- 
cription of the actual advent of ice and snow. It also 
informs us that a Vara or enclosure was made to pro- 
vide against the calamity and that in this Vara, the sun, 
the moon and the stars rose but once a year. 

The cumulative weight of these and other researches 
incontrovertibly establishes Mr. Tilak's theoiy.

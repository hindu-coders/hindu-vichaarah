title: Reactions to AIT

## Embracing AIT

Shrikant Taligeri has a section on the "Hindu Invasionist School"​, quoting fine patriots like BG TiLak, S.D. Kulkarni and vIra sAvarkar supporting AIT.  

- ""V.D. (Veer) Savarkar, who more or less accepted Tilak’s hypothesis,takes equal pride in the “achievements” of the Aryans, but is less inclined to stress the “extermination” of the inferior races, and, infact, tries to suggest that the non-Aryans were relatively few  in number, and that most of them welcomed the Aryan invaders with open arms.""

## Positivity of Aryan and Iranian farmer influx.

- The portrayal of this Aryan migration as some sort of a negative event underlies denial of Aryan migration by reactionary hindu-s. It is combined with misinformation and used as a political tool by Dravidian politicians, communists, missionaries etc..
- Rather, it was a positive event with the heathen cultural ideal of transforming the land into AryAvarta, which involved development of symbiotic relationships.
- Pagan consolidation and dominance

## AIT phobia

- Causes
    - "Political aspect of the whole debate lies in the potential of and past use of the Aryan Invasion /Immigration Theory to justify the Muslim/ British invasion of India and opposition to and ridiculing of the Indian Freedom Struggle or Indian National Movement on that basis."
    - "It also has connections with norh Indians and upper castes particularly Brahmins being picturized as the ancient invaders of India and other Indians being victims of that from ages." \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]
- Manifestation among Indian geneticists
    - Confused statements from Indian authors of [Nature2009](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/nature08365.html) (Lalji, Thiagarajan) : [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/a-note-on-some-recent-work-on-india-genetics/) , exposition [BVP16](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/yUHi_V9tS8Y/03qB1C8PCgAJ).

## Treating AIT phobia

- "this reaction is based in folly and a sad sign of our current intellectual state. One can quite easily be a abhimAni hindu, accept evidence in favor of AIT and repudiate enemy narratives (just think of the great patriot bAlagangAdhara TiLak). We don't even need to be apologetic about any Aryan Invasion, dominance and consolidation (quite the opposite - we can derive pride in it and explore exactly why such stunning success came to pass) - all we have to do is reject the fake equivalence of Aryan invasion with the genocidal invasions of the mlecCha-s in India, the America-s and Australia (which is exactly what PV kANe did - never spilt any ink propping OIT up AFAIK)." \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]
- "​Furthermore, वीरभोग्या वसुन्धरा - nature does not care for moral justifications like "oh we're unjust victims of atrocious foreign dominance. we never did such a thing to others". That's so defeatist and pitiable (besides being false).​ Who are we trying to convince? Does the Pakistani or Chinese nationalist waste any breath justifying his aggression or defense on some inane theory of moral superiority?"  \[[BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/ynh97Vw2Cnk/58B8967QAgAJ)\]

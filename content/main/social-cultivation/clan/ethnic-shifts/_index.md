## Initial hominid settlement
- Narmada cranial fragment is believed to be H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
- Exact date of modern human entry as well as the effect of the giant Toba volcano explosion on Indian hominid population is unclear. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
  - "Likewise, previous archaeological studies have recovered actual human fossils from only around 31,000 years (the Shri Lankan caves), though there are poorly studied assemblages of earlier stone tools from main land India."

## Early Hunter Gatherer settlement
- There were early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G Are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. A represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians. 
- IVC (see below) + IHG gave rise to pre-Aryan Indians (confusingly called ancestral south Indians  / ASI by Reich etal).

## Aryan migration/ invasion
See separate pages on:
- [Arya invasion](Arya-invasion/)
- [Arya consolidation](Arya-consolidation/)
- [OIT Story](oit-story/)

## Austro-Asiatic incursion
See separate page.


## Dravidian bloom
See [dravidian-bloom page](dravidian-bloom/).

## Islamic invasions
These seem to have left comparatively little genetic footprints even among muslims. Partly because they are genetically very similar to the earlier Aryan influx - albeit more admixed with Turkik markers.

## Summary blurp
- First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP.
- Then came early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G Are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. A represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians.
- Then came the Iranian farmer influx. Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate). The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, not to be confused with the later varNa, may have been part of these people.  Many of the middle and service castes are positions on this cline of Indian HG-IRF admixture and have a genetic heritage predominantly of this type. The supports the idea that the diversified service jAti-s typical of India developed in the Harappan system and continued relatively intact after the subsequent Aryan conquest of the land. The IVC language was not Dravidian, but went on to form the substrate of IndoAryan.
- Then came the Aryan invasion and consolidation. This likely happened in collaboration with a faction of IVC elites, some of whom were later incorporated in the highest echolons of Arya society. The soma cult, a distinct feature of I-Ir branch, might have come from them.
- Then came the male-biased Munda influx (likely via sea route into Orissa region) dated to be approximately around 3000 YBP with a lower bound of 3800 YBP.
- Then we have the Dravidian bloom. Harappans spoke a now lost/ subsumed language. In their southern borderlands were DR speakers who admixed with them and acquired some of the Harappan cultural elements. IA met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes. This is indicated by estimated time of L1 haplotype’s blooming after the blooming of the R1a haplotype.
- Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input.

Now, the Arya-s merit special attention:

- Indo-Aryans initially resided in the area around/ beyond the Black Sea, and were familiar with cold and long dawns (as evidenced by some parts of the Vedic texts - long ashvina-shastra to be recited at dawn).
- They radiated out widely, merged with and dominated prior occupants in vast tracts of Eurasia (just as they did in India, Iran etc..). Half of Western European men descended from one Bronze Age ‘king’.
- The IA invaders had "dharma" and a highly effective conservative core, which gave them the edge. (It is not some teme like chariots or gene like lactose tolerance which can explain the massive invasion from the Ural area into Europe and Asia.) This effective structure transferred over quite easily to each land they spread to, leading to secondary expansions such as that of the Dravidians into South India, NE India, SE Asia.
- In India, they similarly merged with a faction of IVC people. Steppe ancestry seen in BMAC first ~2100 BCE.
- Early Arya society consisted of common people (the vish), kShatriya-s and brAhmaNa-s - the lattter formed the elite, and were relatively fluid in early times. The vish might have traded with core IVC people long before the invasions.
- The core portions of RV or even YV far predate their invasion of India. Just equinoctial position indicated by the naxatra-sUkta puts it at around 2200BC, not to mention Thuban, other relatively oblique astronomical references.
- They came in multiple waves. The late RV sarayu and gomati were to the west. They were later moved east perhaps indeed with the movement of ikShavAkus.
- Along with that came great tumult and civil war (eg: mahAbhArata). In the end, kuru-pAnchAla realm was where major brAhmaNa vedic consolidation happened. Gradually, this culture and its carriers (mainly in the form of brAhmaNa-s) spread elsewhere in India and beyond. The hymns were recast, reorganized and their preservation was there shored up.

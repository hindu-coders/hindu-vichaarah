title: CKP (Chandraseniya kAyastha-s)
---

## Motivation
- "Gupte (1919, pp. 6-7) reports that the question of the Vedic rites for the CKPs began with Balāji Avaji's desire to have the upanayana ceremony performed for his elder son in Sake 1591 (1669AD). However, Shivāji's Brahmin ministers Moropant Pingle and Raghunathpant Amātya opposed this notion. Shivāji then sent this dispute to Anantadeva and Gāgābhaṭṭa in Banaras."

## Support
- They claimed descent from kShatriya-s (see theory page) by a story which explained their functioning as accountants.
- Gāgābhaṭṭa allowed them the ceremony of Upanayana, only as a rite of passage (samskāra), but did not allow them the study of the Veda. There is a letter sent out by Raghunātha Paṇḍita, a minister of Shivāji, to the CKPs that refers to Anantadeva and Gāgābhaṭṭa and says that these great scholars had resolved the question of the Kṣatriyahood of the CKPs and their eligibility for Upanayana.

### Text manipulation
#### Observations
- In subsequent disputes on the same issue, two versions of Gāgābhaṭṭa's work on the Kāyasthas seem to have appeared. As K.T. Gupte (1919) reports, the Kāyastha-dharma-dīpa became available in two versions at some point. 
- The Kāyastha-dharma-dīpa known to Gupte prescribed non-Vedic rites for Kāyasthas, but then contained a statement that the Cāndrasenīya Kāyastha Prabhus were not to be treated as śūdras, and that Vedic rites for them will be taught in another text, namely the Kāyastha-dharma-pradīpa: "citragupta-cāndrasenīya-kāyasthayor vedokta-mantra-sahitāḥ kriyās, tās tu matkr̥ta-kāyastha-pradīpe draṣṭavyāh. atra tu kapilakṣīrapānenety ādini kāyasthānām vedādhikāra-niṣedha-parāni vākyāny uktāni. tāni tu saṅkaraja-parāni (iti) bodhyam. citragupta-kāyastha-cāndrasenīya-kāyastha-saṅkaraja-kāyasthā iti kāyastha-padasya jāti-traye 'pi sattvāt kāyastha-padena bhramād dharma-saṅkaro bhavati. tatra ādau asmin granthe śaṅkaraja-kāyasthānām dharma-karmāṇy ucyante. atha kāyastha-dharma-pradipe citragupta-cāndrasenīyayor dharmān vakśyāmi"
- "There are textual indications that the Kāyastha-dharma-pradīpa as printed by Gupte (1919) is concocted by altering the text of the Kāyastha-dharma-dīpa. The benediction of the Kāyastha-dharma-dipa reads: natvābhīra-kiśoraṁ coraṁ vidyudvad-ambudha(da?)-prakhyam / kāyastha-dharma-dipaṁ gāgābhaṭṭas tanoti līlātaḥ // The benediction of the Kāyasthadharmapradīpa reads: natvābhīra-kiśoram coram vidyudvad-ambudha-prakhyam / kāyastha-pradipo 'yam gāgābhaṭṭas tanoti lilātah. Here the second line of the verse does not even scan metrically and is ungrammatical. It seems most likely that the Kāyastha-dharma-pradīpa is a slightly altered version of the Kāyastha-dharma-dīpa."

#### Conclusions
- MD - "I have not found this passage in the Kāyastha-dharma-dīpa mss at the BORI (# 342/ 1887— 1891). I have not found any reference to Kāyastha-dharma-pradīpa in the BORI mss."
- MD07 - "One needs to carefully go through the available manuscript material and its origin in order to fully understand what is going on. It seems likely that Gāgābhaṭṭa's original work did offer Vedic rites for the Kāyastha Prabhus of Maharashtra (as seen in the BORI ms of the Kāyastha-dharma-dipa). Then someone produced a version of Gāgābhaṭṭa's work that treated all Kāyasthas, without exception, as śaṅkaraja śūdras, and took away their Vedic rites.[10] At this point, a pro-CKP pandit inserted the above quoted statement into the text of that work, saying that the vedic rites for the CKPs will be treated in a separate supplementary work, namely the Kāyasthadharmapradīpa, and produced that version.[11] This seems to be a likely course of events, though one cannot be certain without checking all the available manuscript material and its origins."

## Disagreement
- "Other Brahmins were not so sympathetic to the cause of the CKPs in later times. A series of documents from the Satara court of Shāhu, Shivāji's grandson, reveal how the issue erupted and, in spite of Shāhu's sympathy in favor of the CKPs, was for a while resolved against them under the pressure of a massive demonstration by the Brahmins of Pune, Vai, and Satara. With ten thousand Brahmins converging upon Satara, including representatives of Brahmins from Shringeri and Varanasi, the mass śāstrasabhā decided the issue against the CKPs. Here the documents refer to the story of Dālbhya, but with a new twist. The CKPs are made out to be the sons of a Dāsī of Dālbhya, and hence clearly belonging to the status of śūdras. The Karhada Brahmin, Mr. Athalye, who sided with the CKPs and represented their case at the court of Shāhu, was forced to undergo a prāyascitta "expiation" and admit his mistake."
- Referring to a number of such antecedents, Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa issued a stiff set of conditions on the behavior of the CKPs to which they were forced to agree in writing (katabā lihūn dila)-
    - We shall not perform any of our rites with Vedic mantras. Even if known, we will not utter the Vedic mantras. 
    - We will not make rice pindas during the srāddha. 
    - We will carry out the worship of Devi and other rites as per the Purāṇas. 
    - We will not invite Brahmins for a meal in our homes. 
    - We will not do sāligrāma-pūjā. 
    - We will worship only at those shrines where the śūdras worship. 
    - We will say dandavat to Brahmins. 
    - We will not employ Brahmin men and women as servants inside or outside of our homes. 
- "The surviving historical documents indicate to us the political-executive power that the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa put behind this decision. Vad (1911, 287 fr.) not only provides the text of the order issued by the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, he also gives a long list of 196 names of individuals and localities to whom copies of this order were sent and these individuals were advised that any violations of this order would lead to stiff penal ties. Without the backing of the executive authority of the Peshwa, the nirṇayapatra would have remained ineffective."

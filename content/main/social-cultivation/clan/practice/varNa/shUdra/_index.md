## Untouchability
- The objectionable aspects of the jAti-system is now a thing of the past in much of urban India, while it persists in parts of rural India.
    - "Dalit writer Chandrabhan Prasad pointed out in an article that of the 1.81 lakh schools in the state of Uttar Pradesh, barely in one thousand schools had non-Dalit children refused to eat the food cooked by non-Dalits, which reflects the rapidly changing social equations at the ground level in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh. \[Source: Chandrabhan Prasad, ‘Caste revolution’, The Sunday Pioneer (Foray), p V\]."
- "Numerous Hindu saints and savants like Guru Ravidas, Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh tirelessly worked for eradication of untouchability. The great saint Ramanuja of South India (1017-1137) openly condemned untouchablity and adopted many so-called untouchables as his disciples. In Andhra Pradesh, Veera Brahmendra Swamy (10th century) campaigned against the evil, while Basavesvara, a minister of a Kalachuri king (1131-1167 A D) vigorously fought this practice. Again in Andhra, a minister Brahmananda Naidu of Paindu (14th century A D) had openly condemned the evil practice and even appointed an “untouchable” Hindu, named Chenna, as chief of his army." \[[source](http://www.indiatomorrow.co/nation/2025-india-must-guard-against-the-threat-of-a-post-hindu-india)\]

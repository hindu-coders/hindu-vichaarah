## Disputes
- Sometimes the varNa affiliation of certain jAti-s were subject to disptues.
- In marATha times, these disputes were called "grAmaNya"-s.

## Decisions
- The disputes would oft be sent to distant authorities (eg. dharmashAtra writers in kAshi or shankarAchArya-s) for resolution.
- "There was an established pattern of either sending the locally unresolved Dharmaśāstric disputes to authoritative centers of Brahmanical learning like Paithan or Banaras for resolution, or inviting authoritative persons from such centers of learning to the region to resolve the local disputes. We have a number of such decision-documents relating to disputes in the Maharashtrian communities going back to the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries, and this pattern continues into the subsequent periods until the coming of the British colonial rule."

## Enforcement
- "The surviving historical documents indicate to us the political-executive power that the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa behind this decision (about CKP-s). Vad (1911, 287 fr.) not only provides the text of the order issued by the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, he also gives a long list of 196 names of individuals and localities to whom copies of this order were sent and these individuals were advised that any violations of this order would lead to stiff penal ties. Without the backing of the executive authority of the Peshwa, the nirṇayapatra would have remained ineffective."
- "Religious authorities like the various śaṅkarācāryas also issued nirṇayapatras that began with a statement of the high standing of the office and ended with a stamp that reads mahānuśāsanam varīvarti." Example after a long list of adjectives: "srīguru-bhakti-parāyaṇeṣu sakalaśiśya-vr̥ndeśa-kalyāṇābhivardhakāśīḥ-purah-saram anuśāsanīyam idam."

## The stable brAhmaNa core
- The brAhmaNa-s conserved their original ethnicity to a higher degree than the kShatriya-s and others. This stability did not hinder the spread of vaidika ideals throughout initially non-vaidika populations in the early times.  
- Indeed, some dharmashAstra-s get along fine assuming that in the kaliyuga there are only brAhmaNa-s and shUdra-s - the kShatriya-s having disappeared after the nanda takeover, and vaishya-s having given up their AchAra; while others disagree. All this, really, is beside the point. The varNa system was still the framework used to organize the society and settle disputes.

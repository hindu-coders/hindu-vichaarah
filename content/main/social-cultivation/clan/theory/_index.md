title: varNa theory
---

varNa/ jAti = (social role/ hereditary caste) system.  

## Theoretical Structure

- A chAturvarNya universalism. The dharmashAstra-s claimed to explain the origin of EVERY SINGLE population they were aware of - out of admixture and fall of the 4 original varNa-s.​ According to the early smRti-s there was no fifth ([PVK1](http://i.imgur.com/l0XuhbQ.jpg), [PVK2](http://i.imgur.com/LRHL6vV.jpg)). This is a sort of universally applicable framework. They had various  (sometimes peripherally incompatible) theories for their origins, and the ultimate varNa assignment was very very clear. Even the deities had varNa-s \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n99/mode/2up)\] assigned to them! 
    
- The 4 main varNa-s were the brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s (ie dvija-s) and shUdras, who were of two major categories - aniravasita and niravasita.
    
    - Besides these there were tribes who were not following the varNa-system (perhaps because of living in distant lands or in inaccessible places), who were termed as dasyus. They were also termed mlechCha-s if they spoke a very different language.
        
    - In some later works, niravasita-shUdra-s were called avarNa-s (bRhatsamhitA [89.1b](https://archive.org/stream/Brihatsamhita/brihatsamhita#page/n709/mode/2up)).
        

## Prominent traits in the varNa-s:

- Difference in the dominant or prominent occupations.
- Gradation relative to each other (despite their complementaryness)
    - brAhmaNa >= kShatriya > vaiShya > aniravasita shUdra > niravasita shUdra >= populations outside not following chAturvarNya (dasyu-s). 
        - This hierarchy was justified using hypothesized karma from past lives.
            - Eg. bhAgavadgItA calling women, shUdra-s and vaishya-s pApa-yonis.
    - The recommendation by medhAtithi about expanding AryAvarta by a king subjugating the mlechCha-s, and relegating them to the position of chaNDAla-s (niravasita shUdra-s) should make the view of dharmashAstra writers about the place of mlechCha-s in the hierarchy abundantly clear ([PVK_IMG](http://i.imgur.com/rWyjGFD.jpg)). They were considered impure and untouchable ([PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n225/mode/2up)).
    - Consequently, difference in the severity of daNDa (punishments) and , with authorities such as manu and vyAsa prescribing (in nearly all cases) heftier punishments on higher castes.
    - This was motivated not just due to importance of social function, but also because of severe codes of conduct and refinement (tapas and samskAra), as described in the Motivation section.
- Hereditary nature for the most part.
- Restrictions on marriage: endogamy > anuloma exogamy (male of higher caste) > pratiloma exogamy.
    - varNa-s resulting from anuloma unions were considered dvija-s.
    - pratiloma unions (formal or otherwise) were severely discouraged, and their offspring were considered shUdra-s or worse \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n109/mode/2up)\]. "शूद्र.सधर्माणो वा, अन्यत्र चण्डालेभ्यः ॥" \- कौटिल्यः।
        - This applies to suta-s (theoretically illegitimate offspring/ descendents of xatriya males and brAhmaNa females) as well \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n155/mode/2up)\]. The sUta and mAgadha of purANa-s is entirely different according to (kauTilya ०३.७.२९) पौराणिकस् त्व् अन्यः सूतो मागधश् च, ब्रह्म.क्षत्राद् विशेषः ॥
- Restrictions on interdining.
- Different expectations in terms of conduct and personality traits (guNa-s)
    - Gita 18.41says: " ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां शूद्राणां च परंतप। कर्माणि प्रविभक्तानि स्वभावप्रभवैर्गुणैः।।" Nilakanthacharya commentary takes close adherance to the shamAdi-sAdhAraNa-dharma as an example of contrast: "तस्माद्यस्मिन्कस्मिंश्चिद्वर्णे शमादयो दृश्यन्ते स शूद्रोऽप्येतैर्लक्षणैर्ब्राह्मण एव ज्ञातव्यः । यत्र च ब्राह्मणेऽपि शूद्रधर्मा दृश्यन्ते स शूद्र एव ।"

## Mitigations and limitations (barring rare exceptions)

- On the positive end, one observes rarity of the more severe forms of slavery - unlike slave societies of Greece, Rome, Islamic states, early USA. The dharmashAstra tradition forbids any enforcing service by those bound by dharma ("न च बलात् स्वीकर्तव्यः…" [shabara on MS7,6,6](https://imgur.com/a/BWs34%5C), [tr](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282745/2015.282745.Sabara-Bhasya#page/n493/mode/2up)).
    - Example - Megasthenese [TW1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/721326921724882945).
- Most occupations were open to all jAti-s or varNa-s.
    - We don't have the slightest problem loving the mahAbhArata written by the rustic smelly son of a fisherwoman (mentioned thusly in the mahAbhArata) about her descendents, with shUdra heroes like vidura the brahmajjnAnI cum super-archer, ekalavya, ghaTotkacha; while simultaneous supporting a more fluid social dynamic.
    - **Ministership** for all!
        - "mahAbhArata's prescription (an ostensibly "brahmanical" source) placed in the mouth of the dying grandfather bhISma, as part of his lectures on statecraft, that a king should have 4 brAhmaNa & 4 shUdra ministers, 8 kSatriya ministers and 21 vaishya ministers. This may be due to the complexity of regulating various trades and crafts in an ncreasingly sophisticated society."
- Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life and pursue the ultimate Ananda (joy).
    - Prior to the turuShka invasion, the nAstika sects especially offered channel of entry to an intellectual life and social respect by common people.
    - "far from the non-brāhmaṇa population being disenfranchised and deprived of knowledge and rituals, the brāhmaṇa-s constantly innovated new texts, paths and strategies to significantly circumvent any restrictions, which may have been in place... As it is in a diverse, polytheist society, every group of Hindus, has a general right to create its own traditions and develop an exclusive ritual space for its own needs. The rural traditions centred around their local, village pantheons as well as the tribal systems had their own separate, sacred spaces. Even then, brāhmaṇa-s, who overwhelmingly were responsible for developing the śrauta, gṛhya, paurāṇika and āgamika ritual content, were interested in expanding access for their non- brāhmaṇa brethren." \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
    - The case of niShAdha-sthapati-s and rathakAra-s in the veda-s set a good precedent for expanding access for others to enter the broad vaidika system \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
    - shrI-vaiShNava-s
        - āgamaprāmāṇya of yAmunAchArya - "kimiti vā tatparigrahādaprāmāṇyam atraivarṇikatvāditi cet kiṃ bhoḥ traivarṇiketarasavarṇa rathakāraniṣādādi parigṛhītānuṣṭhīyamānārthānām atharvaṇavacasāṃ rathakāra ādadhīta etayā niṣādasthapatiṃ yājayet ityādivacasāṃ prāmāṇyaṃ nāsti |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - bhaṭṭāraka śrī vedottama: "śūdrasyāpyādhikārād avaidikatvam iti yad uktaṃ tad asat, sthapatīṣṭivad upapatteḥ। yathaiva hi “niṣāda sthapatiṃ yājayed” ityatra vācaniko’dhikāraḥ siddhaḥ, tathehāpi bhaviṣyati। “śrāvayec caturo varṇān” iti vacanād itihāsa purāṇādai yathaiva śūdrasyāpyādhikārād, na cāvaidikatvaṃ, tathātrāpi bhaviṣyati ।" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - The shrIvaiShNava tradition includes shudra saints ( [Alvars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvars) ) with stories of their greatness and brAhmaNa-s falling at their feet. Plenty are such religious movements - eg: [vIrashaiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingayat)-s, sikh-s.
        - shrIvaiShnava Initiation - pancha-samskAra (prapatti/ samAshrayaNam) is available to all people irrespective of caste - [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7jG3GJ8NK0).
    - shaiva-siddhAnta
        -  kāmikāgama uttarabhāga 23.220-221a : "ityevaṃ kathitā dīkṣā sarvapāpavimocanī | catvāro brāhmaṇādyāścāpyanulomāśca ye matāḥ || nyāyajā gūḍhajātā vā dīkṣāyāmadhikāriṇaḥ |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]
        - hierarchical guru-authority: "viprādayastrayo varṇāḥ dīkṣāyāṃ sthāpane’pi ca | brāhmaṇakṣatriyādīnāṃ kṣatriyaḥ śūdra vaiśyayoḥ || vaiśyaḥ śūdrasya dīkṣāyāṃ svasyajātāvapīṣyate | svārtheṣṭau cala liṃgasya pratiṣṭhāyāṃ trayasvime || śūdropi śūdradīkṣāyāṃ svārthe ca calasaṃjñake |" \[[AS17](http://indiafacts.org/access-ritual-knowledge-hinduism-case-veda-agama/)\]

## Role of later traditions

Some people falsely generalize later anti-varNAshrama traditions.

- Agamika pAncharAtra tradition strongly supports varNAshrama-dharma.
    - See quotes in the "Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life" section.
- shaiva-siddhAnta supports varNAshrama-vyavasthA.
    - "iti varNAshramAchArAn manasApi na la~nghayet | yo yasminn Ashrame tiShThan dIkShitaH shivashAsane | sa tasminn eva samtiShThech ChivadharmaM ca pAlayet || ... siddhAnta shaiva did not forsake his Ashrama or varNa when he attained dIkSha into the shaiva path and was not a means of “revolting against” or “escaping” the ordinances of the Aryas. ... the general followers were encouraged to maintain their existing life-style/profession and varNa-related observances, while accomodating the shaiva observances with that framework. In fact the basic dharma-shAstric injunctions are relating to other nitya issues are reiterated by the shiva-dharma." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/06/23/siddhanta-tantrics-and-the-mainstream-brahminical-path/)\]
    - See quotes in the "Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life" section.

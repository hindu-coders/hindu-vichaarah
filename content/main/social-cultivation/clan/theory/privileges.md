title: Privilege contrast
---

- The dharma system was framed more in terms of duties than rights or privileges. This fundamental difference should not be forgotten. However, in modern debates, it sometimes becomes necessary to get an accurate picture of privileges that existed in practice.

## Untouchability

The following classes of people / circumstances were subject to untouchability rules according to the smRti-s:

- A person who has committed a grave sin (mahApAtaka), but has not performed prAyashchitta.
- People whose spiritual practices were abhorrent to certain other people. Eg - bauddha-s jaina-s nAstika-s, even pAshupata-s and sAnkhya-s according to some texts.
- People following undersirable professions. Eg. a devalaka, a purohita for an entire village, hunter, butcher, fisherman etc..
- People in circumstances generating ashaucha. Eg.
    - Women in their periods.
    - A person shortly after a relative's death or a birth.
    - An uchChiShTa who is yet to wash his hands after/ while eating.
    - A person who has touched a corpse, but is yet to bathe.
- Certain races such as the mlechCha-s.

### Untouchable jAti-s

- There is no compelling evidence that untouchability existed in the Vedic Indo Aryan society.
- The smRti-s also do not recognize people the existance of people within the hindu society who were excluded from the 4 varNa-s and untouchable.

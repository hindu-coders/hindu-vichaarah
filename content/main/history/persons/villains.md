Where there are heroes, villains are no surprise. Many were self-professed ghAzis (mujAhids intent on jihAd). Others power hungry people who pursued personal ambition at the cost of higher ideals.



## Religious villains

- [kalinga-magha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalinga_Magha), pillager, destroyer of bauddha temples in lankA - a rAvaNa of modern times.  

- mahmUd of ghazni, pillager, destroyer of temples (including sOmanAtha), who firmly established a deep distaste for turuShkas in hindu and shramaNa hearts.
- alauddIn khilji, who coveted rANI padminI, destroyer of temples, whose general malik kafur spread destruction to the south.
- Malik Kafur, the eununch general of alauddIn khilji, who reached as far as kanchi and rAmEshvaram, destroyer of temples.
- Firoz Tughlaq, who outlawed the practice of the dharma - even in private - in dilli.  

- Syed Ali bin Shahab-ud-Din Hamadani Abidi, also known as Amir-I-Kabir or Ali-I-Sani, the Suhrawardi-> Kubrawi order sufi who ensured the success of the islamic contagion in kAshmIra cleverly (anti-hindu edicts [1](../../../images/snippets/hamdAni-edicts.png)).
- Rinchan aka sadruddin, the Tibetan usurper and iconoclast (constructed “Bud Masheed”, on the site of a Buddhist temple) who took to Islam.
- [sikandar bhUt-shikAn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandar_Butshikan), as his title suggests, the idol-breaker sultAn of kAshmIr, who fuelled with the mad zeal of the sUfi-s, also delighted in burning critical books, giving the usual convert-or-die choice to hindu-s, who banned music and festivity. A true exemplar of "kAshmIriyat".  

- Ghiyasuddin Al Damaghani, sultan of madurai, whose depravity is described by Ibn Batuta \[[AS16](https://agentsaffron.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/the-saviors-of-dharma-in-south-india-part-1/)\].
- mahmUd beragha, sultAn of gujarAt, a  monstrous person who ate 100 mutton samosa-s a day with a pot of ghee daily, destroyed temples, had an appetite for seizing Hindu women to add to his harem ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/a-pashupata-temple-desecrated-by-mahmud-begarha/)).
- kAlA-pahAD, formerly ferocious oriya general rAjIv lochan ray who converted to islam because of fury at orthodox blockage of desire to marry the paThan sultan's daughter, who raided jagannAtha-purI, supposedly murdered by gajapati remnants (such as princess sAmbhaleshvarI).  

- [awrangzib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb), [impozer](http://www.aurangzeb.info/) of jizya, destroyer of temples (बिन्दु-माधव [ट्१](../../../images/snippets/awrangzeb-bindu-mAdhav-edict.jpg)).
- Tippu sultAn, who pillaged and converted people at sword point in kEraLa. \[Sandeep [Dec 2014](http://www.dailyo.in/opinion/why-tipu-sultan-was-a-false-hero/story/1/1278.html).\]
- daud sayed gilAni aka David Coleman Headley, opportunistic and ideologically motivated spy for lashkar-e-tayyaba and ISI, US-double agent, who [cased out](http://video.pbs.org/video/2169905444) locations for the Dec 2008 mumbai attacks.  


## Hindu traitors
- udayasimha, treacherous son and murderer of rANA kumbha.
- shilAditya the pUrvIya tomara who betrayed sangrAma-simha of mevAr to bAbuur.
- Sewand Rai, general of masUd of ghazni: "Only fifty days after the death of Mahmud, his son despatched Sewand Rai, a Hindu chief, with a large body of Hindu cavalry in pursuit of the nobles who had espoused the cause of his brother. Sewand Rai died in the ensuing battle." 
- tilak, the bauddha/ hindu general of Masud of Ghazni: "The son of a barber, he became a confidant of Khwaja Ahmed Hasan Maimandi, the influential wazir of Sultan Mahmud. The khwaja made Tilak his secretary and interpreter, and in 1033, when news was received from Lahore of the rebellion of Ahmad Niyaltigin, it was Tilak who was sent to deal with the situation. The extreme measures taken by the Hindu general against the Muslim partisans of Ahmad show his confidence and sense of security.".
- hemant karkare, policeman who framed and tortured the likes of Lt Col shrIkAnta purohit and sAdhvI prajJNA, before ultimately (and ironically) being killed by jihAdi-s.

### Various traitor marATha-s:
- Bhim Singh, who was conferred the title Raja Ghorpade Bahadur (Dakkani word for the Varanus lizard) by the Sultan at the behest of minister Gavan and his brother.
  - "The Turks advanced again, and Appaji decided to hold them up using the same tactic of defending from the well-fortified Vishalgad. However, Karan Singh and Bhim Singh were breeders of the Varanus lizard which they used in climbing forts. Accordingly Karan and Bhim decided to help the Moslems in taking the fort, in return for the province of Wai. Karan and Bhim sent out several lizards to scale the precipice on which the fort was located with ropes tied to them. With the aid of these ropes they climbed the fort and sent down rope ladders for more men to follow them. Then they cut their way to the main fort gate and opened it. In the process Karan Singh was killed by the Hindu defenders but the Moslems managed to get in and massacred Appaji and his men. With the fall of Vishalgad, Mahmud Gavan attacked the Chalukyan army by surprise at Samgameshvar." [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/04/06/war-in-the-konkan/)
- [raghunAth rAv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghunathrao), the highly capable but power-hungry uncle of the good peshvA [mAdhav rAv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghunathrao), whose machinations and alliances with enemy powers only weakened the marATha confrederacy.
- AnandI-bAyi, power-hungry wife of raghunAth rAv, murdress.
- murAri rao, servant of the Qutub Shahi, who stole the Ahobilam idol
- paTTavardhana who stole the hiNDi of tirupati
- lamaans (a caste dealing with grain) under Raghunath rao ‘dada’ Kurundwadkar (brother of parashurAma-bhau) who looted shRngagiri during the time of Tippu sultAn (marATha-s made amends later). ([SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/what-exactly-happened-at-sringeri-math-in-april-1791/))

## Hindu charlatans

These bring the sanAtana dharma to disrepute, even as they deceive feeble hindu-s.

-  Swami Nithyananda - the center of a sex scandal in 2010s. Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyTT2UrTSCc) where he gleefully dances over his father's corpse, then 'liberates' it by stomping on its forehead, gives it diksha post mortem, and declares it a sishya-turned-sanyasi.

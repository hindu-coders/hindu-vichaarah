## Levant appearence and genetics

  - \[[Fayum portraits](https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/fayum-portraits/) are burials of middle class Egyptians from Cleopatra's era.

- "There have been quite a few DNA studies on modern Egyptians, and to date, no noticeable amount of DNA from Italy or Greece has been detected, or DNA from anyone other than Arab, Berber and African. The same argument could equally point out that modern Egyptians could actually be darker than the ancient because of the Nubian invasion lead by Piye. Other DNA studies on prehistoric North Africa have revealed mostly Caucasian DNA (Taforalt site), and studies of the teeth, skulls and hair monotonously place Egyptians in the same category as modern North Africans – mainly Caucasian, a bit of African ancestry at the South."
- Modern day Coptics, who speak a descendent of ancient Egyptian, are very fair. So are many of other modern Egyptians.

### Blackness of Egyptians and Racism
Evidence indicates that ancient Egyptians were like neighboring levantine populations in appearence and genetics. They were neither "blacks" nor "whites" in contemporary terms. Yet, many people (with SJW tendencies, particularly in the America) say things like: "Kemeticism is a black religion" - [TW20](https://twitter.com/Khenneferitw/status/1268427854972432385), "Ancient Egyptians were blacks", "I don’t care about genetics, that’s not what this is about. That’s why the other person was trying to talk about “biological racism”. These are social categories in a discourse of power." [TW20](https://twitter.com/EPButler/status/1268744232627568643). 

- What do modern Egyptians would think of foreigners repeatedly inaccurately insisting that their ancestors were "blacks" or "whites". 
- Also, it is not like "blacks" don't have proud traditions of their own so that we need to do them the charity of thrusting some fictitious heritage on them. THAT is condescendingly racist.
- Racism is propagation of discrimination and inequality based on race. What would it have to do with veracity of "egyptians were blacks"? It is an old Euro-american habit to superimpose their fancies on foreign cultures in reaction to their terrible internal problems. For example: secularism motivated by their bloody catholic-protestant conflicts, svastika-hatred because of Nazi experience, "white" Aryanism motivated by racial superiority theories, denial of genetic disparity in mental faculties due to guilty-conscience over slaver racism.

## Egyptian language

- Many claim monophyly with semitic, assyrrian, chadic etc.. Some contest semitic monophyly, speaking of absence of common inherited concept hierarchy which cant be explained as loans.
- Later survived among copts.

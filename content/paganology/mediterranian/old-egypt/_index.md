## Genetics
- Levant appearence and genetics \[[fayum portraits](https://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/fayum-portraits/),[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/869797224334675968)\].
- "There have been quite a few DNA studies on modern Egyptians, and to date, no noticeable amount of DNA from Italy or Greece has been detected, or DNA from anyone other than Arab, Berber and African. The same argument could equally point out that modern Egyptians could actually be darker than the ancient because of the Nubian invasion lead by Piye. Other DNA studies on prehistoric North Africa have revealed mostly Caucasian DNA (Taforalt site), and studies of the teeth, skulls and hair monotonously place Egyptians in the same category as modern North Africans â€“ mainly Caucasian, a bit of African ancestry at the South."

## Egyptian language

- Many claim monophyly with semitic, assyrrian, chadic etc.. Some contest semitic monophyly, speaking of absence of common inherited concept hierarchy which cant be explained as loans.
- Later survived among copts.

## Cause of rise
Why did Rome expand from a small city state to an empire which spanned 3 continents?

In the Roman republic, every notable person seeking greater power and reputation had to gain military victories. This meant that positive ambition was never in short supply.

## Leaders
- Gaius Julius Caesar
  - raised in the wealthy patrician gens Julia, his family lost everything because the father sided the loosing side in a civil war.
  - Joined the army to regain prestige and wealth, became a seasoned soldier.
  - Convinced the wealthy merchant Crassus not to retreat, to do a suprise attack and defeat the huge army of Spartacus.
  - Lost his wife Capurnia to illness.
  - Took advantage of the rivalry and the resulting stalemate between Crassus and Pompei to broker a peace by getting himself elected Consul of the Senate after gaining Pompei's trust by giving his daughter Julia in marriage. (From his father's fall, he had was wary of being on the loosing side of another civil war - so he thought beyond loyalty to Crassus.)
  - Conquered Gaul, studying and crushing local resistance and killing Vercingetorix
  - Even campaigned in Britannia
  - Defeated Pompei Magnus
  - Conquered Egypt, fell in love with intelligent and manipulative Cleopatra
  - Returned to Rome to be offered the throne, but was murdered by Senators led by Brutus who were afraid of his rising popularity.
- Kaiser (Caeser) Augustus Octavian, first emperor, avenger of his adopted father's murder, bringer of virtue and strength.
  - Got rid of critics such as Cicero.
  - He wisely sidelined the less disciplined soldier Marcus Antonius (based in Egypt, loving Cleopatra) and routed him.
  - As part of the succession arrangements, Augustus adopted Tiberius on 26 June AD 4, but first required him to adopt Germanicus, thus placing him next in the line of succession after Tiberius.
- Germanicus, brilliant General,
  - who avenged and recovered the three lost eagles from the ambushed legions, designated successor of Tiberius, raised imperial suspicions by his independent actions there,
  - recalled and sent to Asia, reorganized various client kingdoms,
  - sadly likely murdered by paranoid and jealous Tiberius.
- Tiberius, of gens Claudia, step son of Augustus, imperator for 23 years.
  - He became paranoid and ordered treason trials (punishing slightest criticisms harshly).
  - Likely murdered much loved general Germanicus to secure his son's succession - but lost his son to illness. With the fueling of his paranoia by Sejanus, he further had the remainder of Germanicus's family - including the irate wife Agrippina, exiled, killed or confined under the treason trials.
  - Retreated to the island of Capri in paranoia, leaving much power in the hands of the head of Preatorian Guard, Sejanus. There he pursued a life of decadance. Sejanus took advantage and increased his power and wealth - partly with confiscations as part of further "treason" purges of Senators.
  - Killed Sejanus with the help of Macro, former head of Roman vigiles/ police, via a letter to the senate where Sejanus was cleverly summoned with praise.
  - Brought Caligula, son of Germanicus, to Capri. Played with his mind, while grooming him to be a possible successor. Named Caligula and very young grandson Gemellus as joint successors. 
- Caligula (boot straps), son of celebrated general Germanicus, grandson of general Drusus, raised for his first 7 years in various military camps.
  - Traumatically witnessed the murder of his father, exile and imprisonment of family. Grew up in confinement, brought to Capri and supposedly made to participate in whimsical activities by Tiberius, besides being groomed to succeed. 
  - Sidelined Gemellus, making him adopted son and heir instead.
  - A good ruler for the first 7 months
    - commissioned good public works
    - pardoned many of Tiberius's political exiles, cancelled treason trials.
    - restarted the games
    - initially very popular as the restored son of Germanicus.
  - Went through a 3 month "brain fever" which changed his personality.
  - In paranoia Eliminated allies such as the head of the praetorian guard Macro, even young Gemellus. Macro had attempted to ally himself with Gemellus when it appeared that Caligula might die of fever.
  - He immersed himself in desultory decadent orgies. Started incest with his sisters (probably at the prodding of the eldest Agrippina). His married sister Drusilla became pregnant by him, but died.
  - The remainder plotted to kill him, but were caught and exiled.Agrippina
  - Ordered treason trials to replenish treasury and carry on decadence. That failed, so he increased taxes.
  - Killed off his cousin Ptolmey of Mauretania
  - To recover popularity, ordered an invasion of Britannia, but the soldiers resisted and he changed his mind - and supposedly paraded fake captives.
  - The senate conspired with the Praetorian Guard to kill him.
- Claudius, brother of Germanicus, uncle of Caligula, succeeded as emperor after securing support of the Praetorian Guard and foiling Roman Senatorial Republic plans. He was underestimated by opponents, and wasa  competent emperor. He expanded the empire into Brittannia and added Eastern provinces. Had a troubled family life, where his ambitious wife Messalina cuckolded him and eliminated rivals before being killed. In her stead, he married her rival and his neice, Agrippina sister of Caligula.
- Nero, son of Agrippina, step son of Claudius came to power. He expanded and consolidated teh empire. Got his mother overbearing mother Agrippina murdered. Became more vain. Became unpopular after the great fire of Rome. A military coup and adversarial senate let to his suicide.

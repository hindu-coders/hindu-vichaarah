## Incessant Emanationism
- "Pagan Neoplatonists were not creationists. Instead, they speculated that the process of the emergence of the universe from their divine principle, has gone on forever, just as it continues at this very moment and will continue to do so, sustaining a world without end. ... reality emerged from “the First” in coherent stages, in such a way that one stage functions as creative principle of the next."

### Concomitant inner and outer activities
- "every activity in the world is in some sense double insofar as it possesses both an inner and an outer aspect." And this applies recursively - with outer effect having other outer effects.
- "The outer effect is not the purpose or end of the inner activity; rather, it is simply the case that one falls out of the other and is concomitant with it."
  - Thence: "Hypostasis" is defined: underlyingness of an entity.
- "For example, the inner activity of the sun (nuclear fusion, as we now know) has the outer effect of heat and light, themselves activities as well. Or the inner activity of a tree that is determined by the kind of tree it is (its genetic code, we would now say; the Neoplatonists spoke of an inherent formative principle, logos) results in the bearing of a particular kind of fruit; or again, thoughts and feelings internal to human beings express themselves in speech and actions."
- "Furthermore, it is also the case that these outer activities will typically be productive of yet other outer activities that are ontologically more remote and derivative: Fruit serves as nourishment or poison for other individual life forms, and human speech and action constitute, over time, a person’s biography or a society’s history. "

### The ultimate cause
- To Hen (τό ἕν), The One, First, The Good.  Hence the the first “Hypostasis”.
- "an entity that is beyond Being, transcending all physical reality, very little can actually be said, except that it is absolute Unity. However, we know empirically of its effect, the entire universe, and we must therefore suppose that the One is the carrier of, or rather identical with, a boundless sort of singular activity or energy. "

### Nous
- the outer activity and effect of the First must be nous - pure and absolute “Consciousness”.  Hence the the second “Hypostasis”.
- Consciousness would not be some kind of emergent property of material constituents arranged in a certain way, but rather be the first effect of the activity of the One.
- "What, then, is the inner activity of Consciousness? The inherent task of consciousness is to understand, and understanding entails the cognition of causes. In trying to understand itself, Consciousness can only turn towards its origin and thus posit or behold the First as the transcendent principle of its own reality."

#### Forms
- "Becoming thus aware of another entity, the originary unity of Consciousness breaks up into duality, and with it emerge the categories of identity and difference, of greater and smaller, of number, of change and of rest."
- "Forms of the Neoplatonists, far from being mere schemata, definitions, or ghostly blueprints of the natural world, are rather noetic entities teeming with conscious life. "
- "Neoplatonists assumed as axiomatic that nothing could come to be here below that is not prefigured paradigmatically in the intelligible realm."  .. Every form we see in reality pre-exists in the Nous.

#### Demiurge
- "In the Timaeus, Plato had described in detail the structure and function of the world soul (outer effect of Nous), and had recounted the way in which it was put together by a divine craftsman (demiurge) and conjoined with the realm of disorderly matter."
- "Although the Neoplatonists followed Platonic tradition in talking about a demiurge (divine craftsman), their cosmology has nothing demiurgic about it, as Plotinus rarely failed to point out. ... "

### World Soul (psychê)
"Soul, a further hypostasis of being that effortlessly “falls out of” the inner activity of Consciousness in a similar way as Consciousness “fell out of” the First, is the link that facilitates the manifestation of form in matter."

### Henads
- henad, unit; the term is taken by Iamblichus, Syrianus and Proclus from Plato’s Philebus, where it is used interchangeably with the term ‘monad’. henad is the first principle (arche/ ἀρχή) and the measure ( metron) of being; the One is unparticipable, but the henads are participable, therefore they correlate with real beings.
- Proclus divides henads into transcendent or independent units and those that are immanent and belong to their participants and are irradiations of the first.
- in theurgy, henads constitute a set of theophanies, i.e. divinity in its many diffenent forms at all different levels of reality, therefore divine henad stands for the god-entity as a whole; the difference between the One and the participable henads (which may be compared with the Egyptian neteru), opens the theurgic way of adoration, worship and ascent.

### Attributes
- ""Hyperessential" (Greek huperousios) refers to entities like the Gods who transcend being or substance. "

## Adoration of the Gods
- Theurgy (θεουργία) describes the practice of rituals, sometimes seen as magical in nature, performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the presence of one or more deities, especially with the goal of achieving henosis (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.

## Tradition
Middle Platonists, possibly Hindus ->  Ammonius Saccas (died c. AD 265) an apostate -> Plotinus (c. 205 – c. 270) of Egypt -> Porphyry (c. 233–c. 309) of Syria -> Iamblichus (c. 245 – c. 325) of Syria.

Later, Hypatia (c. 360 – 415) of Egypt who was burned by Christians, Proclus Lycaeus (February 8, 412 – April 17, 485) of Lycia in Anatolia, Roman Emperor Julian (331/332 – 26 June 363)) the apostate and his friend Sallustius.

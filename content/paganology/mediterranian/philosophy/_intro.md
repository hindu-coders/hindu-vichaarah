## Theology
### Summary
"Tired: gods are fake/just dead people, except the stars (euhemerism)
 Wired: gods are the elements, but also the elements are alive. And there are invisible god people (stoicism)
 Divinely inspired: gods are hyperessential henadic hypostases emanating a seira (neoplatonism)" - [KM](https://twitter.com/KaraMartiana/status/1077528569365049345)

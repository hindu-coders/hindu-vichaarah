## Old irAnic religion
- A sibling of the Arya deva-dharma, a child of the ancestral Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-Aryan. They shared several deva-s with the Arya-s.

### deva-s
- "From the fragments of the pre-Achaemenid Medians and Persians, and also to certain extant the later Parthians and shAkas we observe that the system based on the worship of the Aditya-s (though they are never called that) was the dominant one. Especially, mitra, varuNa, bhaga (who came to be widely transmitted throughout the ancient Iranic sphere - "bhAgdAd" to the Turks and mongols - "bhagaputra/ bhagAtur, ulAn bATar")." [MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/12/26/iranian-miscellany/)
- "the mighty vAyu, even after zarathuShTra’s heterodox sweep, remained the first receiver of the haoma in the Iranian ritual. From the Kushana evidence we note that vAyu was extremely prominent and perhaps the preeminent deity in the eastern Iranian frontier."
- "indra is only third in the system"
- "The goddess aredvI sUrA anAhitA, the sarasvatI ortholog, was one of the Iranian deities to receive an iconic representation from very early on. ...  Like sarasvatI (also perhaps even the prototype of Pallas Athena, sarasvatI and anAhitA), she had a warrior aspect. "

### Rituals
- "Iranians, like their Indic counterparts, were largely un-iconic in public ritual to start with, probably using icons only in small private shrines."
- "On the eastern front things were dramatically different, with Iranians receiving iconographic inputs not just from the Greeks but also Indians. For example vAyu of the Kushanas inherits his iconography from rudra in India. ...  The goddess aredvI sUrA anAhitA, the sarasvatI ortholog, was one of the Iranian deities to receive an iconic representation from very early on. It appears that even Artaxerxes-II, who had a special devotion to this goddess, might have founded iconic temples of hers at Hamadan, Babylon and Damascus. In the early period her iconography was influenced by Semitic goddesses such as Ishtar. But in the eastern zone of the Iranian territory her iconography was clearly influenced by chaNdikA or durgA."


## jarad-uShTra's reconfiguration
### yazata-s
- "In the amesha spenta-s we find an invention of new devatA-s, in part to conceal the old ones. Thus, the abstractions of vohu-manaH, asha vahishta, and khshathra-vairiya are raised to devatA-s. The abstractions haurvatAt and amaratAt are used to conceal the old demonized twin devatA-s (i.e. the ashvinau)." [MT-iShmin](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/)
- "The old devatA-s mithra (=mitra), baga (=bhaga), airiyaman(=aryaman), vAyu (same), aredvI surA anAhitA (=sarasvatI), haoma (=soma), thworashtar (=tvaShTar), thrita (=trita), apAm-napAt (same), spentA Armaiti (=aramati), yima vivanghat (=yama vaivasvata), and nairyosangha (=narAshaMsa) were, in large part, maintained as is but reconfigured as partisans of the ahuric force directed against the daeva-s." [MT-iShmin](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/)
- "Some devatA-s were retained as is, but they were given a new preferred named, and in some cases their old preferred name might being demonized as a daeva. Thus, the old varuNA received a new preferred appellation of ahura mazdA; viShNu received a new name raShnu, suggesting that the old ‘vi-‘ prefix was interpreted as a negative ‘vi-‘ prefix and replaced by a “right” “ra-” prefix; indra received the preferred name verethraghna, even as the name indra (andra) was demonized as indra-daeva; agni also received a new preferred name in the form of Atar." [MT-iShmin](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ishmin-and-the-raudra-devata-s/)
- "the most drastic change, i.e. the attenuation of the “raudra” class of deities ... In the avesta only vAyu is retained and the rest of this class is apparently nullified or transmogrified. This is rather dramatic relative to what happened in the Indo-Aryan sister group. Here, the old raudra class underwent major changes but was never attenuated as in the avestan world. "

### Demonized deva-s
- "he innovates to create a new “head daeva” for his pandemonium:Angra manyu who is described as: daevAnAm daevotamA. Angra manyu is followed by the following series: indra daeva; saurva daeva; nAnghaithya daeva; taurvi; zairi; aeshma. Of this series the first three are transparent demonizations of indra, sharva and the nAsatyA. ... "
- "taurvi has no counterpart in the veda, though its cognate tUrvi used in a positive sense to described deva-s."
- "we cannot rule out the possibility that a demonized viShNu equivalent underlies the zairi of the Iranians." 
- "In the Iranian tradition recorded during the Sassanian rule we have one more demon coming after nAnghaithya daeva named tarOmaiti (tarOmat in Pahlavi) who is battled by the goddess spentA Armaiti (or just Armaiti). We posit that tarOmaiti corresponds to an inversion of Armaiti who is the daughter of ahura mazdA in the Iranian world. "
- "aeshma is one of the most feared entities of the avestan tradition." Cognate with vedic ishmin. rudra/marut-class.

### Rituals
"In fact the cult of zarathuShTra was a vigorously iconoclastic one which appears to have been imbibed by the Judaistic stream of the Semitic world. But on the other hand other Middle Eastern Semites and Elamites appear to have influenced the Iranians towards iconic worship."

### Motivations
"The old IE system, like many heathen systems, has deities who as actions relative to humans or their domesticated animals is ambivalent. The raudra class of deities are epitomes of this ambivalence of action. Why the Hindu system revels in the various shades of grey, zarathuShtra was driven by black and white binary thought. "

## Influence on Jews
- "While some people try to trace the emergence of Abrahamistic eka-rAkShasatvaM to the exclusivist worship of Aten by Akhenaton, we have argued that its iconoclastic streak is more consistent with a transfer from the zarathuStrians. "
- "The evidence for the transfer of aeshma-daeva comes from the story narrated in the Judaistic book of Tobiah: In the Iranian province of mAda (Media) lived a Jewish woman Sarah. She was seized by ashmedai (Judaist version of aeshma-daeva). ... The Semitic deity Rafael befriended Tobiah and taught him a ritual with a burnt offering of fish meat to subjugate ashmedai. As result he was able to successfully drive away ashmedai and marry Sarah. ...  The setting of the story in an old Iranian province, the idea of a specific deity (Rafael) to counter ashmedai, and a specific ritual for this purpose supports the whole-scale transfer of the meme from a zarathuShtrian source. Importantly, in the narrative of Sarah, ashmedai kills seven of her husbands before Tobiah marries her. In the bundahishn (28.15) of the Iranians, aeshma daeva is described as having 7 powers to utterly destroy creatures who he seizes. This numerical correspondence clinches the above hypothesis."

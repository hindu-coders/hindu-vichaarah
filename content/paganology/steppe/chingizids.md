Chingizid Menggu/Mengwu/ Mongol tribe. The great chingiz temujin khAn (family tree [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Genghis_Khan)) conquered and started the empire. He drew inspiration from the Hunas.

Thence emerged:

- The Golden horde (urdu)/ Ulus of Jochi towards Russia, which after Öz Beg Khan declined due to internal conflict and Islamicized.
- (Chagatai) Tsagadaina Khaanat Ulus ruled over mughalistaan in Ferghana area - also islamicized.
    - gUrkhAni-s Timur and babur's mogols (displaced by Oirat-s) came thence.
- House of Ögedei, later split and subsumed by chagatai and Tolui's descendents. 
- Tolui's yuan dynasty came from his Nestorian Christian wife Sorghaghtani Beki.
- From Tolui's son - Hulagu-yn Ulus/ Ilkhanate accross Iran, Iraq etc., which also islamized.

## Il-khAns
- " Il-Khans had conquered Mesopotamia after annihilating the Shi’a power of the Hashishins and the Sunni Kilafat. So the Mohammedans were no longer a political force in Mesopotamia. Yet they were able to destroy the external influences and re-establish the Shari’a." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
- "Due to the Mohammedan persecution of various groups favored by Arghun he came up with a plan to conquer Mecca and restore heathen worship there with construction of temples of buddhakapAla and heruka, but due to other preoccupations he failed to do so. Indeed, during the Ilkhanid regime multiple temples to buddhakapAla, kAlachakra and hevajra had been built in Baghdad, Tabriz and in some places in the province of Khurasan." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/some-notes-on-rashid-ad-din-bin-imad-ud-dawla-abul-khair-and-his-times/)\]
- [Ghazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazan), shortly before he overthrew [Baydu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baydu), converted to [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam").

## Secularism failed here

## Ritual systems
- “There was a great battle between the demons and the Tengri in which the latter were defeated. They turned to Qormusta Khan Tengri (ahura mazdA), the high god, for aid. He declared that their defeat was due to them having no horse-standard and recommended that they invoke the Suelde Tengri the god of the horse-banner. Then appeared 9 divine brothers armed with swords, tiger-skin quivers and bows, the eldest of whom was Suelde Tengri, riding fiery horses (corresponding to the nine horse tails of the banner). Aided by these deities, the Tengri fought the demons and defeated them.” {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)}
- "Chingiz is also said to have formalized other rituals such as those of marriage. Walther Heissig noted that in eastern Mongolia they still recite this history during the pre-marriage ritual: “The fortunate Chingiz Kha’Khan, the incarnation of Qormusta Tengri, at the time when he took to wife Boerte [Footnote 3], the daughter of the Bayan of the Khunggirad tribe, the subject of Ughichud, sent his wise officials, led by the ministers Boghorju and Muqali [Footnote 4] and following the custom of the old, the custom was fulfilled to ask after the name and the year of birth of the bride. He is said to have introduced the ritual of anointing the yurt followed by the worship of the deities of the sun and moon and making offerings to the yurt hearth fire.” The last can be compared to the ritual offering to the gArhapatya fire in the Hindu tradition."

### Late Indo-tibetan influence

- Tension with the earlier IA influenced tengri-ism \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)\]
- "Chingizids of the Qubilaid line might have waned into anonymity had they found a new leader in the form of the direct descendent of Qubilai Khan, Puṇyaśrī Oljei Temür. On one hand Puṇyaśrī was a learned Sanskritist, with literary interests going beyond the vajrayāṇa tantra-s and encompassing the works of Daṇḍin and Bhojadeva Paramāra. On the other he was a vigorous warrior who started rebuilding the Mongol army and drew back the Arans to his side. He repulsed the Ming thrusts into Mongolia and struck out at the Chinese forces in several encounters to the south. ... in 1424 CE the Arans and Puṇyaśrī had a falling out and the latter was killed in the conflict." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/some-notes-on-the-rise-of-oirat-power-and-the-jangar-tuuli/)\]
- Adoration of the 5th dalAi lAma sonam gyatso by Altan kakhAn, partial suppression of shamanism \[[TW17](https://i.imgur.com/c7LQTfL.jpg)\]
- Later transmission through the geluk-influenced incarnation of tAranAtha - jJNAnavajra (zanbazar).

## Summary
- From the lowest start in an abandoned family where he hunted for survival and spent time as a captive, he rose to form timely alliances, to recover his kidnapped wife, to raid others, thence to (revolutionarily) incorporate spared conquered people into his own band iteratively, all while repeatedly escaping death in battle, betrayal and traps, constantly improving war tactics and strategy despite starting from just basic hunting, raiding and herding instincts.
- A shaman in his own right, he devised new laws and military organizational systems for his people; favored merit and loyalty over past lineage, made his people rise over their internecine conflicts. He inspired great loyalty. He set apart the Burkhan Khaldun mountain surroundings as a sacred and restricted area - which continues to this day. He came to be regarded as a great spirit, as an incarnation of Quormazda (~Ahura Mazda) Tengri.
- Understanding where his mongol band stood relative to the surrounding powers and where riches from the sedentary people lay, he determined to found a hun-like steppe empire, secured his northern (sibir), western, eastern frontiers before learning seige craft, incorporating new war technology and engineering, herding captured civilians as human sheilds and laborers, buring farms and villages for pasture, setting up relay communication system, learning about enemy setups and divisions.
- Then he started picking off the Tanguts and the Jurchen controlled north China. And then the Uighurs, Khwarazm Turk sultanate. Then Persia, afghanistan, and the western qAra khitai. From Korea to Eastern Europe did his mongols go. In all this, novel technology and tactics were used including leveraging mobility by attacking from multiple points (crossing a desert unexpectedly in case of the Khwarazm), doing excellent propaganda - "surrender and be treated well, or resist and be fully slaughtered", spawning and herding refugees, killing off all the old elite.
- From his lineage sprang great conquerors and many able successors. Family tree [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Genghis_Khan)
- Alas, his secularism and tolerance of abrahamisms sucked out mongolness and the grace of tengri from one islamized half; while sedentary decadance did the other major part in.
- "The biggest impact that has been uncovered to date appears to be that of Chingiz Kha’Khan, the founder of the great Mongol nation, who appears to have left behind 16 million male descendents in the modern world."

## Low start
- Born in a lowly and poor family of the Borjigin tribe which lived on northern forested fringes of Mongol society which survived mostly by hunting (rather than herding) along with occassional raiding.
- Even within his family, he was the son of his father's second wife Hoelun. After his betrothal as a 8/9 year old to Beorte, his father died and he returned to see his family abandoned by the rest of the Tayichiyuds. Hoelun heroically marshalled the family and they scraped by with their hunts. His elder half-brother bullied him - and got hunted to death by himself and his brother as a result.
- For this crime, he was made captive by the Tayichiyuds, whence he escaped thanks to the beneficence of a servant family.

## Securing family
- He returned and grew older, brought Boerte home. Made an alliance with his father's anda / blood brother, the Mongol Christian Ong Khan of the Kereyid.
- Boerte was kidnapped by the Merkid to the north - with the grace of his home mount Burkhan Khaldun, he escaped. Giving thanks to the sacred mountain, with the help of Ong Khan and his vassal Jamuka (also Temujin's adolescent blood brother/ anda) he recovered his now pregnant wife. Thence was born Jochi (guest) of uncertain parentage, whom he raised as his own.
- In time were born Chagatai, Ogodei and Tolui.

## Uniting mongols
- Thence he split from Jamuka, who was treating him inequitably; joined the Jurchen inspired Ong Khan in raiding the Tatars to the east, then fought Jamuka (who now claimed to be Gurkhan) and Tayichiyuds. In the next Tatar raid, departing from past practice - he totally destroyed them -having postponed looting till after they could destroy all combatants; then he incorporated remnants into his own band as adapted family. He divided people into squads of multiples of tens (overriding tribe loyalty).
- Ong Khan rejected the now powerful Temujin's marriage offer, then set a trap (allied with Jamuka) by fake acceptance. Temujin and his small party of ~17 men (including 3 muslims, many christians and buddhists) fled for days in the direction of Lake Baljuna. Thence he called forth his new tribe. They routed Ong Khan's folks (most of whom anyway defected). Then he attacked the Naiman with his unpredictable skirmishes, "moving bush" tactics, wave-like attacks before switching to chisel formation.
- Jamuka escaped, but was betrayed and executed with his betrayers.
- In next year's kuriltai, he named his people "yeke mongol ulus" and became chingiz (wolf-like firm) khan. The shamans and his people said "huree huree" (~hurray).

### Laws and ritual
- Thence he gave his people the great law -  the Ikh Yasag (the Great Yasa). He abolished previously common practices of intra-mongol slavery, bride kidnapping, bride selling, cross-family adultry, animal rustling - thereby increasing harmony. Further he restricted hunting to winter, instituted tolerance for all religions, election of the next khan by a family kuriltai, recognized group guilt.
- "Chingiz is also said to have formalized other rituals such as those of marriage. Walther Heissig noted that in eastern Mongolia they still recite this history during the pre-marriage ritual: “The fortunate Chingiz Kha’Khan, the incarnation of Qormusta Tengri, at the time when he took to wife Boerte [Footnote 3], the daughter of the Bayan of the Khunggirad tribe, the subject of Ughichud, sent his wise officials, led by the ministers Boghorju and Muqali [Footnote 4] and following the custom of the old, the custom was fulfilled to ask after the name and the year of birth of the bride. He is said to have introduced the ritual of anointing the yurt followed by the worship of the deities of the sun and moon and making offerings to the yurt hearth fire.” The last can be compared to the ritual offering to the gArhapatya fire in the Hindu tradition."
- "It is notable that the yasag had an aspect paralleled the dharma of the Hindus and maat of the Egyptians. Just as dharma has the divine dimension of the laws laid down by the great gods Mitra and Varuṇa (captured in the śruti) at the base of the yasag was the old “divine law” of the Turks and Mongols known as the törü which is said to have been promulgated by the god Köke Möngke Tengri. On this rested the yasag of the great Khan which was like the smṛti brought to humans by Yama and our law-giver father Manu."

#### Later influence

- Major parts of these laws were abandoned, while others were continued after his death.
- "Among the Mongols it seems to have inspired later reforms of law like the “Code of Altan Khan” promulgated by Altan Khan in the 1500s. The yasag’s influence was so powerful that even after the conversion of the western Mongols to Mohammedanism it exerted its influence against the sharia. "
- The yasag’s influence was so powerful that even after the conversion of the western Mongols to Mohammedanism it exerted its influence against the sharia.
  - For example, Muhammad Shaybani Khan in the 1500s overturned a decision of his Qāzi-s by stating that the correct decision would follow the yasag of Chingiz Khan. 
  - Similarly, after the execution of a brāhmaṇa (who had told the marūnmatta-s that their founder was an unmatta) by a shaikh against the Mogol tyrant Akbar’s wishes we see him increasingly remodeling his law as per the yasag of Chingiz Khan and moving away from the sharia. This culminated in Akbar commissioning the production of the illustrated work, the Chingiz Khan Nāmā, in 1596 CE. Not surprisingly we see the Mohammedan Badā’ūnī pour his scorn on the yasag.
- "Finally, we may also mention in passing that it included dimensions, like the tamgha system, which played a key role in driving the economy of the unified “world system” of the Mongols."

### Organization
He continued his army organization, started a mail system with fast riders and outposts.

## Mongol World wars
### Building on prior steppe powers
- Chingiz Khan exploited the knowledge and techniques of prior steppe powers- especially the Khitai and Uyghur.
- "This was accompanied by the recognition of the region around the Ötükän mountains near the Orkhon river in Central Mongolia as a holy territory of the Khans. ... Thus, the foundational Hun empire defined the religious geography of the later Mongolic homeland." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\].
- "The population of Mongolia at the time of the great Khan is estimated to have been around 700,000 people, who were divided and lost in conflict. ... Despite all this background the best of the earlier Uighur Kha’khans and Khitan Khans were not Chingiz Khan. Thus, the backdrop of the buildup of innovations among the Altaic people, rather than contradicting, actually shows that Chingiz Khan stood apart from the best the steppe had produced. There are two sides to this, military and administrative. "\[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\].

### Securing the base
The below heavily copies \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\].

The big enemies to the south, the Jin and the Tangut were objects in need of serious action as settled people but like the Khitans before him once engaged in combating settled people he could have lost the base in Mongolia to others who had the advantage like him, namely powerful mounted cavalry enemies like the Turkic groups to the west and Islamized Turks even further west. So he proceed systematically by : 
- (i) defeating and absorbing the Turkic groups to the immediate west; 
- (ii) clearing the eastern flank completely by conquering the Koreans and eastern Khitan holdouts. Similarly, the northern flank was cleared by defeating all tribal groups to the north; 
- (iii) then inflicting a serious blow on the Jin but not engaging them in their own turf in an involved campaign of taking major fortified centers; 
- (iv) Conducting the great outflanking operation to the west by clearing the forces of the Ghāzis and the Rus to a great distance. By this configuration he ensured that he stabilized a well-defined home-base for the Mongols.
- Then he stung the Jin strongly enough to ensure that they would find it hard to threaten Mongolia while he dealt with the west but did not engage them in depth right then. 
- Then he proceeded west to neutralize the serious threat from all other cavalry powers which could fight by similar means as him. 

### Tackling the Tangut and jin
By this he created strategic depth and a cast a pincer-grip on the Tangut to destroy them in his final campaign. Through this period he kept the Jin on low burn after the initial hammering he gave them. Thus he left for his successors the stranglehold on them which they quickly tightened to put an end to the mighty Jin.

## Tech innovations
"Second, while there are many examples of tactical brilliance through all his campaigns, one notable point is his innovative development of military technology like firepower and siege-craft to take fortified centers of settled zones. This was one deficiency which Altaic steppe powers routinely had – the inability to take fortified power-centers settled zones effectively. After Chingiz we even see a relapse to this state among successor states like those of the Oirats.

However, his development of innovative siege-craft, firepower, “biological warfare” and hydraulic works to divert rivers in flooding cities allowed them smash these strongholds like no one before them. Other innovations included the use of military booms (chains) on rivers to block naval operations of enemies, like in the campaign to bring down the Mohammedan Turk Temür Maliq."  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]

"In this the Chingiz Khan set a precedence which allowed his people to clearly exceed the previous steppe powers including the Uighurs who in a sense where their first teachers. Importantly, in the domain of practical knowledge they were good at picking out things which were critical and useful with great avidity – medicine and weaponry are two cases – we see this starting with the great Khan himself taking a great interest in assembling the best of the knowledge of the world at that point. The quick adoption of printing and standardizing of text production went on to allow extensive documentation of the newly acquired knowledge."

"This trend continued among the successors of the Chingiz Khan with Hülegü having Nasser ad-din al Tusi take the books that mattered most, like those on astronomy and medicine, from the Hāśīśin library upon the sack of their citadel. He also recognized the value of a individual like Nasser for his knowledge while demolishing the rest of the Mohammedan edifice. His brother Qublai Khan’s astronomical observatory employing astronomers across the empire was another example of the interest in knowledge in a more general sense. Finally, Qublai’s chartering of several thousands of schools throughout his realm allowed this knowledge to plowed back into the population."

## Merit and elite
- Chingiz killed quickly off old elite after their defeat (as he had done since early raids on Tatars barring exceptions he later regretted and fixed). "Likewise, he showed no mercy for any level of the Jurchen or Tangut and their sinitic or sinicized power-holders. These he simply destroyed and replaced with his talent. This was followed by his successors with the southern Han power centers. This was very different in form and action from previous client-patron relationship that both steppe-land and sedentary powers tried to establish."  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]
- "A key aspect of the plan was the kind of accommodation he showed for different preexisting power structures: He was rather clear about meritocracy and was willing to take in various Uighur, other Turkic, Khitan, and Aran/Alan talent for his cause. For instance he appointed the Khitans Yelü Ahai and Yelü Tuhua to rule over the lands he took from the Mohammedans in Khwarizm.

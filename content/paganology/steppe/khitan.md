- Liao (eastern khitan) empires. Toppled by Tungustic jurchen. The jurchen were in turn toppled and pushed south by Chingiz Khan; aided by khiTan remnants who acted as their bridge with Chinese.
- Yelü Dashi's Qara (western/ black) khiTai uncharacteristically resisted conversion to Islam even while ruling over muslim subjects, in contrast with several other turkish and mongol branches. \[[SP16](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/725049903102197761)\] \[[MT17](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)\]

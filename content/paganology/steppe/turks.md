## Kök Türük Göktürk Khaganate 
- [Kök Türük (Gök Türk = Blue Turk)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)
- They took over from the Hunnic Rouran khanate.
- "However, legacy of the Blue Turks was lasting one- it gave the Turks the the concept of a nation, ethnic identity and made them into a civilizational influence. This  was also influenced the Mongols who had made similar earlier attempts at nationhoods in founding the two great Hunnic Khanates \[commonly termed the Xiongnu and Rouran or Juan-Juan Khanates\]. .. Their rise for the Turks was as momentous as the rise of the Bharatas amidst the Indo-Aryans. ... However, it had not sunk deep enough for the transformation of the entire Altaic people. Here lie the roots of modern Turkey and the Central Asian Stans’  identity crisis  which was hijacked by the desert delusion in the centuries to come. "  \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)\]

## Uyghur
- Tocharians and shaka-s -> uighur (with significant genetic input)
- "The Uighur Turks, who absorbed the earlier Indo-European Tocharian civilization, showed how a genuine steppe potentate, which mixes militarism directed against sedentary populations and trade with them, could emerge. Notably, they laid the foundations for many aspects of the government of a steppe empire, which the later Mongols would adopt. These included the first script of the Chingizid Mongols. Ironically, they were a major bulwark against the spread of Mohammedanism into the eastern steppes; thus, they allowed the survival and subsequent efflorescence of heathen steppe cultures." {[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/)}

+++
Lord Naoshige once said, “There is nothing felt quite
so deeply as giri. There are times when someone
like a cousin dies and it is not a matter of shedding
tears. But we may hear of someone who lived fifty
or a hundred years ago, of whom we know nothing and who has
no family ties with us whatsoever, and yet from a sense giri shed
tears.”
When Lord Naoshige was passing by a place called Chiriku,
someone said to him, ’ ’In this place there lives a man who
is over ninety years old. Since this man is so fortunate, why
don’t you stop and see him?” Naoshige heard this and said,
“How could anyone be more pitiful than this man? How many
of his children and grandchildren do you suppose he has seen
fall before his very eyes? Where is the good fortune in that?”
It seems that he did not stop to see the man.
When Lord Naoshige was speaking to his grandson, Lord
Motoshige, he said, “No matter whether one be of high or low
rank, a family line is something that will decline when its time
has come. If one tries to keep it from going to ruin at that time,
it will have an unsightly finish. If one thinks that the time has
come, it is best to let it go down with good grace. Doing so, he
may even cause it to be maintained.”
It is said that Motoshige’s younger brother heard this from
him.
Chapter 4
When Nabeshima
Tadanao
W
hen Nabeshima Tadanao was fifteen years old, a
manservant in the kitchen committed some rude
act and a foot soldier was about to beat him,
but in the end the servant cut the soldier down.
The clan elders deemed the death sentence appropriate, saying
that the man had in the first place erred in matters concerning
the ranks of men, and that he had also shed the blood of his
opponent. Tadanao heard this and said, “Which is worse, to
err in matters concerning the ranks of men or to stray from the
Way of the Samurai ?”
The elders were unable to answer. Then Tadanao said, ”I
have read that when the crime itself is unclear, the punishment
should be light. Put him in confinement for a while.“
Once, when Lord Katsushige was hunting at Shiroishi, he
shot a large boar. Everyone came running up to see it and
said, ”Well, well. You have brought down an uncommonly large
one !” Suddenly the boar got up and dashed into their midst.
All of them fled in confusion, but Nabeshima Matabet drew
his sword and finished it off. At that point Lord Katsushige
covered his face with his sleeve and said, “It sure is dusty.” This
was presumably because he did not want to see the spectacle of
his flustered men.
When Lord Katsushige was young, he was instructed by his
father, Lord Naoshige, “For practice in cutting, execute some
men who have been condemned to death.” Thus, in the place
that is now within the western gate, ten men were lined up,
and Katsushige continued to decapitate one after another until
he had executed nine of them. When he came to the tenth, he
saw that the man was young and healthy and said, “I’m tired of
cutting now. I’ll spare this man’s life.” And the man’s life was
saved.
Lord Katsushige always used to say that there are four kinds
of retainers. They are the “quick, then lapping,” the “lagging,
then quick,” the “continually quick,” and the ”continually lagging.”
The “continually quick” are men who when given orders will
undertake their execution quickly and settle the matter well.
Fukuchi Kichizaemon and the like resemble this type.
The “lagging, then quick” are men who, though lacking in
understanding when given orders, prepare quickly and bring the
matter to a conclusion. I suppose that Nakano Kazuma and men
similar are like this.
The “quick, then lagging” are men who when given orders
seem to be going to settle things but in their preparation take
time and procrastinate. There are many people like this.
Other than these, one could say that the rest are ”continually
lagging.”

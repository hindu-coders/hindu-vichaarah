- Sumo (very clear Shinto roots, all wrestlers including foreigners have to participate in shrine visits & rituals), agriculture (believed to be taught by kami to Japanese & hence ritually reenacted such as @ Sumiyoshi shrine), timekeeping (assoc with Omi jingu shrine, big clock companies like Casio & Seiko dedicated their clocks there), sword making (just watch any Samurai sword makers documentary, u will see the Shinto rituals to be performed), Traditional soy sauce & sake breweries both have rituals for the kami.
- "Alcohol makers in general (including foreign drinks like whiskey) https://t.co/t2239dShr6 Shinkansen & the rail companies building them also have kamidana in their offices. Many big Japanese corps r associated with specific shrines whether it be due to the given kami being known for its connection with the industry the company is involved in or because the founder of the corp was big devotee (e.g. Sazo Idemitsu the founder of Idemitsu was a worshiper at Munakata shrine & made big contributions to its renovation)"

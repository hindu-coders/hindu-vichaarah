title: Risks
---

## Intro
Becoming a Hindu is an excellent thing! Still, it is advisable be bold as well as intelligent. Anticipate the risks you will face, and work around them!

## Social
- Your family members may need to be convinced (eg. wife/ husband).
- Some of your relatives may boycott you. +++(Just make new friends.)+++
- Your house owner may ask you to vacate. +++(Then just find a new house.)+++

## Economic
- Your employer may discriminate against you. +++(Then just change your job.)+++

### Inheritence issues
- In case of reconversion - one will be entitled to all benefits of Hindu law.
  - +++(PS: People who have converted out of Hinduism to Christianity or Islam have no right to ancestral property - they just have a share in parents' property.)+++ 
- In case persons from whom you inherit property are Christians - either Indian succession act or Hindu succession act applies depending on the religion of the deceased person. Either case, no problem. Of course, a parent can make a will to specifically exclude certain people from inheritence.
- In case of conversion from Islam to Hinduism - the convert looses all entitlement to family property. +++(Just stand on your own feet and be self-sufficient!)+++

## Security
- In rare cases, individuals belonging to your old religion (eg. Muslim fanatics) may resort to violence against you and your family. In such cases, please consider getting security. You can try [contacting us](../../contact/) or local hindu orgs for help.

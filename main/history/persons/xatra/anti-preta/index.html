<li>&ldquo;Kashishwar made a deep impression on the santals and a large number of them embraced Hinduism. They gave up eating pigs, fowls and other food considered obnoxious by the Hindus. It needs to be mentioned here that there was a similarity in observances and tenets between the Sapha Hor of Santal Parganas and the Satyam Shibam of Malda. The followers of the Sapha Hor also did not take pigs or fowls nor did they drink toddy or pachwai. While the Sapha Hor was santals and half way to Hinduism, the Satyam Shibams were full-fledged Hindus. Both these sects had adopted the principles of pollution and purification of the Hindus. Kashishwar Chakraborty selected his favourite disciples from every village and conferred him with the title sardar. Every sardar received the particular cloth, turban and a piece of silver, in which the words &quot; Satyam Shibam Sundaram&rdquo; were inscribed. Sardars had to look after the practice of social norms and customs of their villages. The title sardar was a prestigious one and disciples rendered a habitual obedience to them. At every village there was a &ldquo;Kalithan&rdquo; where on every Tuesday evening disciples used to pray, worship and sing.&rdquo;</li>

<li>The mlechas of England having captured our country, tread over the sanathana dharma of the Hindus and destroy them.

<ul>
<li>Acceeding to the wishes of MK gandhi to withdraw from prime minister candidacy in favor of javAharlAl nehru ultimately ruined the country.</li>
<li>Mild opposition to the activities of NB Khare.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nArAyaNa-bhAskara-khare
<ul>
<li>As prime minister of Alwar state: achieved huge conversions in bharatpUr and AlvAr in 1947-48. Alwar was ~30% Muslim in 1941. It was 6% Muslim in 1951. &ldquo;Meo peasants were in revolt, incited by both the Communists and an assorted bunch of Muslim organisations [not just the Muslim League]. They were clamouring for Meostan, burning temples, slaughtering cows and raping Hindus. Faced with these troubles, Khare turned this crisis into an opportunity. He put together a Hindu force made up mostly of Jats and Gujjars, and began paying the Jihadis and the Communists in their own coin. Communists and Jihadis were ruthlessly crushed, and Meos converted.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He was consistently opposed by government and Congress folks (including Patel, Gandhi and Nehru) and arrested, but they thankfully failed.</li>
<li>Being in charge of &ldquo;commonwealth relations&rdquo; in viceroy&rsquo;s executive council: &ldquo;He was responsible for placing on the Statute book the Indian Reciprocity Act Amendment Bill and enforcing it against South African Europeans for getting acquitted all the highly placed Indians in Malaya, like Dr. Goho, who were charged with high treason and collaboration with the Japanese, for securing rights of citizenship for Indians domiciled in America, for withdrawing the High Commissioner of India from South Africa, for applying economic sanctions against South Africa and for lodging complaint against South Africa in the United Nations.&rdquo;</li>

<li>bhIm rAv <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar">ambeDkar</a>, who strived for respect and opportunities for the untouchable jAti-s (sAvarkar on him: <a href="../../../images/snippets/sAvarkar-on-ambeDkar.jpg">img1</a>) - even at the cost of hinduism or Indian independence, an intelligent subversive inimical to hindus, used Christian categories to accomplish this (JDRoover <a href="http://swarajyamag.com/politics/counterview-ambedkar-was-wrong-about-hinduism-the-right-can-stop-trying-to-appropriate-him">here</a>), who transformed into a hindu cultural nationalist ally (CR<a href="http://centreright.in/2012/04/bodhi-sattvas-hindutva-part-1/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/">ambedkar_partition</a>, sanskrit promotion <a href="http://i.imgur.com/h6N5vQ2.jpg">P1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Parikramah/status/582703386337792000">T194909</a>,  ..) when circumstances made the continuation of British empire unlikely, and ultimately strived to ensure that dalita-s stay within the fold of dhArmic religions while rejecting caste hindu orthodoxy [<a href="https://twitter.com/parikramah/status/582704308262555648">T1936</a>], a <a href="http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm">clear thinker</a> in regards to the security of hindustAn.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;His education, encouraged and financed largely by the Gaikwad of Baroda, led to his role as the Untouchable&rsquo;s chief spokesman, the founder of a political party for Untouchables, and the moving spirit behind organizations, schools, and colleges established for their uplift.&rdquo;</li>
<li>It is clear that bhImrAv Ambedkar was not an advocate of Indian independence (if not openly against it at times). For example, AruN Shourie says about him [<a href="http://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed1.htm">htm</a> , <a href="../../../images/snippets/wavell-on-ambeDkar.png">IMG</a>]: &ldquo;The Untouchables have stayed out of the Freedom Movement for good and strong reasons, he says again and again.&rdquo;</li>
<li>His efforts to reactivate the mAhar regiment in the British army was only motivated by the desire for social upliftment rather than the &ldquo;learn to fight and rebel&rdquo; hopes of Savarkar.</li>
<li>bhImrAv was (mostly willingly) a sort of enemy agent (someone used by the Brits to weaken and fracture the high caste Hindu dominated Indian independence movement). We would have got rid of untouchability etc.. (as the Japanese, Koreans, French and Spaniards did) without him as well, while preserving more of a feeling of national brotherhood. But he was somehow pumped up, like the khujliwal of Delhi. (That British would use these dalit leaders to subvert and fracture the hindus who were demanding that they leave is a no-brainer.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;In the 1930s and 40s, like other acclaimed heroes of social reform such as M.N. Roy and Periyar Ramaswamy Naicker, Dr. Ambedkar was literally a paid agent of the British, even becoming the Member for Labour of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council.&rdquo; (<a href="http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/wiah/ch11.htm">KE</a>)</li>
<li>This he did collude with the Brits (his big bet) and the preta-s. [eg <a href="http://www.sakshitimes.net/blog/2008/09/22/dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-defender-of-conversions-and-a-friend-of-christianity-294/">here</a>] It is only late in his life, after his attempts to convince the Brits to rule on with dalit help failed [<a href="https://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed.htm">AS_Redif</a>, <a href="https://aryasamajvserranthindus.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/dalits-helped-british-conquer-india-b-r-ambedkar/">WP</a>] that he decided to tie dalit fate with buddhists so as to not denationalize them from the Hindu society where they found themselves.</li>
<li>All this said, I do not begrudge bhImrAv - an intelligent enemy is better than a stupid friend. He knew when it was time to leave his treachery be. In that sense, it was far better that we deal with him than upper caste stupid &ldquo;friends&rdquo; such as the baldie and the chacha (without offence intended to anyone, this holds true today too).</li>
<li>Among his bad legacies is a constitution that deviated from the spirit of the hindu dharmashAstra-s (../explained <a href="../social-cultivation/dharma/">here</a>). “People always keep saying to me, oh, you are the maker of the Constitution. My answer is, I was a hack. What I was asked to do, I did much against my will. I am quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn it. It does not suit anybody.” - B R Ambedkar on the floor of Rajya Sabha, on 2 Sep 1953, while debating in favour of the AP State formation.</li>

<li>
<p>kAnhojI jEDhE deshmukh, deputed by Shahaji himself to protect shivAjI, who as a senior nobleman at a crucial juncture (during the Afzal Khan campaign) inspired and convinced all the deshkumkh-s to fight for svarAj rather than buckle towards Adil Shah, played major role in planning and executing battle of pratApgaD against Afzal Khan.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Kanhoji Jedhe went to Rajgad with the firmans received from Afzal Khan and publicly declared that he would relinquish his lands and his earnings to Shivaji but not join Afzal Khan. This simple act of bravery and farsightedness had an electrifying effect : that someone with the experience and seniority of Kanhoji Jedhe was supporting Shivaji meant that Swarajya was an idea they could and should fight for. All defections to Afzal Khan immediately stopped.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>pratAprAv gujjar, a gifted general who defeated mogols at salher, made the mistake of releasing AdilshAhi general bahlol khan with troops and supplies at Nesari. shivAji scolded him in a letter, so he rode alone (followed by 6 others) in a suicide charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raghunAtha nArAyaNa hanmante, author of  rAjavyavahArakosha (<a href="https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/536370856206020609">ref</a>), who left the service of Tanjore&rsquo;s Ekoji (aka vyAnkoji) Bhonsle to join his half-brother the brilliant shivAji, who counselled merciful quelling of ekoji&rsquo;s despicable forwarding of muhammedan interests. He was made governor of the resulting southern conquests. He similarly publicly rebuked a wayward sambhAji.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baji_Prabhu">bAji prabhu</a> deshpANDe, a chandrasenIya kAyastha prabhu (dejure quasi-kShatriya dvija), who sacrificed his life at ghoD khiND delaying the enemy while ensuring shivAji&rsquo;s escape. (Joke <a href="../../../images/snippets/bAji-prabhu-joke.png">1</a>). His son Pilaji, who was taken Prisoner by the Sidi of Janjira and converted to Islam, reverted to Hinduism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>murAr bAji the kAyastha, who successfully defended purandara fort defiantly and with astounding energy despite superior enemy firepower and numbers [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murarbaji">W</a>].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dhanaji Jadhav (1650–1708), able commander, harassed the mughals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Santaji Mhaloji Ghorpade, (1660-1696) of the broader bhosale community, named by Shivaji on his death bed to be among six pillars of Maratha Empire, who in a daring feat cut the ropes of Aurangzeb’s tents and took the imperial golden pinnacles and fled boosting marATha morale and confidence, argued oft with rAjArAm over decisions and was sacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hambirrAv mohite, commander in chief of shivAjI and shambhu, father of Tarabai.</p>
<ul>
<li>In early 1676, Hambirrao led a daring raid into Mughal territory as far as Bharuch in Gujarat &amp; after much heroic fighting, brought back a large booty to the Raigad treasury. Later, during the karNATaka campaign, when shivAji had to rush back to raigarh, hambirrAv defeated Adil shAh armies and Ekoji.</li>
<li>During the attack on diler khAn and mogols while aiding Adil shAh - he saved shivAji&rsquo;s trapped army and trounced diler&rsquo;s army.</li>
<li>He harassed the mogols under sambAji- &ldquo;Shahabuddin Khan, father of Nizam-ul-Mulk, advanced with a huge army to take Raigad. Crisis once again! And yet again it was Hambirrao&rsquo;s cavalry which fell upon d besiegers routing them completely! Hambirrao immediately followed that up with another counter attack. 60 miles South East of Pune, Aurangzeb had setup an elephant stable with a large number of elephants. Hambirrao&rsquo;s cavalry swooped down upon it, massacred the Mughal garrison drove off d entire herd of elephants! &hellip; Shivaji had massacred Afzal Khan&rsquo;s army in the forests below Pratapgad. It was Sarja&rsquo;s turn now. Hambirrao drew Sarja Khan&rsquo;s army deeper into the dense jungles around Mahabaleshwar &amp; suddenly fell upon them. &hellip; The Mughals were completely surrounded &amp; massacred. But just at that moment of a decisive victory a most tragic event happened. Hambirrao was hit by a stray gun shot &amp; fell dead.&rdquo;.
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Then the Mogol mined two of the hill slopes leading up to Mahabaleshwar plateau where the Maharattas were stationed and filling them with explosives, detonated it. Shaken by these two explosions the Maharattas began to flee helter-skelter. The Mogols soon rolled their heavy artillery and opened heavy fire on Hambirrao’s army. Hambirrao realized that his men would not hold out much longer and a defeat more or less guaranteed the end the Maharatta resistance to the Mogols in Maharashtra. Unless he turned the tide right there there was no hope stopping the Mogols from marching right through. With a chosen group of 100 ace commandos he rushed straight at Sarja Khan with the aim of killing him. This Maharatta band fought with unbelievable fury leaving a lane of blood and severed heads through the Mogol army. The swordsmanship of Mohite was unrivalled as he cut deep into the Mogol troops bringing down all before him and reaching the artillery line. His men fell upon the Mogol heavy artillery and destroyed the operators and wetted the powder. Seeing the tables turning, the fleeing rank and file of the Maharatta army recovered and fell upon the Mogols with renewed fury. The Mogols were completely swept away by the attack destroyed. However, in the midst of this Sarja Khan surrounded Hambirrao. The Mohite’s horse was shot down under him, but he continued fighting on foot and struck Sarja with his sword killing him. He was attacked on all sides and his strength was ebbing from the cuts he received. But leaning against a tree Hambirrao continued fighting keeping the Moslem assilants at bay till head was finally cut off. However, the surge of the Maharatta army was so great that the Mogol army was completely destroyed.&rdquo; [<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/02/the-death-of-hambirrao/">MT</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;But the cost of this last great victory of the Maharatta army in Sambhaji’s reign was most expensive. In intelligent leadership, knowledge of the terrain and strategy, Hambirrao had been unmatched. Further, he was the only one who had dared to challenge Kalash and mitigate his negative effect on Sambhaji. As Kincaid the British commentator states, had the brave Hambirrao lived he had all the skill and resources to repulse the Mogol offensive. But with his death the Maharatta army in Maharashtra became rudderless. This was followed soon after by Sambhaji’s capture and execution by the Mogols.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Dada Rane Sardesai, from the legendary Maratha clan of Ranes, initiated the Rane Revolt of 1895. <a href="https://twitter.com/maharattas/status/1266326534966648832">TW</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Background: &ldquo;On September 14, 1895 the Maratha soldiers of Goa were ordered to set sail to Mozambique where they would die out a slow death. As all dignified men do, they refused collectively. They rode out to Sattari and conquered the fort of Nanuz and requested Dada Rane Sardesai of Sattari, to take up their leadership. Dada Rane himself was infuriated that Portuguese encroachers were distributing land of his forefathers among the Narcornis. Thus the united parties under the leadership of Dada Rane unleashed their Revolt on October 14, 1895.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Fights: &ldquo;Dada Rane first mounted an assault against Bardez and looted the Tivim Church where all the hoarded treasures of Hindus accumulated by the Portuguese came into their hands and with this they swiftly struck next at Mapusa. The garrison surrendered as the Mayor was attacked and the entire Municipal Treasury fell into the hands of the rebels. Moving on, they invaded Colvale and broke open the Community Safe. The impact of Dada Rane&rsquo;s ferocity was such that some of the local merchants, landlords and others fled to British India. &hellip; To support them, a reinforcement fleet was deployed from Portugal itself led by their own Prince Alfonso Henriques. With their bolstered numbers and morale, the Portuguese Prince and the Governor-General attacked Dada Rane together. Despite this, the revolt was further intensified and the Portuguese had to end up inviting Dada’s spiritual guru, Shankaracharya of Sankeshwar, who requested Dada to conclude the mutiny peacefully!&rdquo;</li>
<li>End: &ldquo;They were sentenced guilty and in 1902, he was sentenced to exile in Timor in the Pacific ocean, where he and his son, Indroji, died in the course of time.&rdquo;</li>

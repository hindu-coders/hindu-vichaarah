Soon the yAdava-s fell under the subversion. \[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemadpant#Writings), [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/13/the-cracks-in-the-edifice/)\]

There was virtually no resistance. Ballala hastened back & now became a vassal himself.
It was Ballala's turn to now aid Kafur. Ballala personally accompanied Kafur & guided his army over the mountain passes (which would be unknown to an imvader) & led him on to the capital of Vira Pandya. As Vira Pandya fled from place to place an immense booty on the backs of 120 elephants fell into the hands of Kafur. Kafur in hot pursuit ransacked Kanchipuram."

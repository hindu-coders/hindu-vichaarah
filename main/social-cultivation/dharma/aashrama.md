## Intro

An individual's life passes through various phases. Important among them were described and suggested by dharma-shAstra writers with the view of bringing and maintaining individual and social harmony. Phase transitions were especially marked. Following are the four major stages of life: 

- brahmacharya - Student life, starting with upanayana and ending with samAvartana.
    - naiShThika-brahmacharya, starting with a special ceremony after samAvartana. "He may also rekindle the fire with a ‘substitute wife[10]’... he may rekindle the fire alone for himself[11] (Trikandamandana 3.128) and taking Shraddha (faith/conviction) as his ‘substitute wife’ may perform agnihotra etc. " [Nithin](http://indiafacts.org/sati-dharmic-perspective/#_ednref14)
- gRhastha - Householder life, starting with vivAha/ marriage. The most important Ashrama, for this is where family traditions are maintained. 
    - brahmachArin-s taking up sannyAsa or vAnaprastha without marriage is criticized.
        - Eg. indra in MBh - "ke cid gṛhān parityajya vanam abhyagaman dvijāḥ/ ajātaśmaśravo mandāḥ kule jātāḥ pravavrajuḥ/ etc.." \[[GA16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/756753649888481281)\]
    - Mate choice and marriage maintenance - [KV18](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/marriage-advice-for-hindu-snataka-s/).
    - "Hindu parents rooted in Dharma are living temples." \[OGS\]
- vAnaprastha - Retirement to forest. (vaikhAnasa-gRhya-sUtra gives a procedure for transition to this Ashrama, while others don't.)
- sannyAsa - Asceticism in pursuit of mokSha or Ananda (../described [here](../tattvam/purushaartha/)), mostly to the neglect of pravRtti-dharma.
    - Not at all dealt with by the gRhya-sUtra-s - some say because it is out of scope, others say that this is because this Ashrama was unknown, unpopular or frowned upon.
    - Early mention in the bRhadAraNyaka. An easy extension of the naiShThika-brahmachArI concept. Possibly later gained more and more acceptance due to the influential shramaNa streams.
    - Rejected by several later texts as kali-varjya.
    - The controversial role of Ananda-pursuit in the neglect of dharma by hindu-s is considered [here](../../tattvam/purushaartha/).

## gRhasthAshrama

- Main purpose
    - Production of offspring
    - Supporting other Ashrama-s (brahmachArin-s, sannyAsin-s)
    - Harmonious achievement of dharma, artha, kAma.
- The bond
    - Co-sacrificer relationship: yajamAna-patnI
        - The fire comes from the wife's parents' house.
        - When needed, they make fire with the araNI together.
    - guru-shishyA relationship: [IMG](https://imgur.com/SrLfzQd).
- Child marriage.
    - shatAvadhAnI gaNesh's view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXustFOkOr4&feature=em-uploademail).
    - Child marriage is referred to in the distant past, but very rarely.
    - Consummation ritual ought to happen on the fourth day of marriage - this indicates that adult marriage was intended. But later practice changed this and introduced a delay. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/849856736110362624)\]
    - Common ages of marriage, classically, were: 20 for men (having completed 12 years of education starting at 8) and about 16 for women.
    - Note: It should not be considered inferior to adult marriage out of hand.
- Inbreeding
    - prohibited by manu
    - Prevelant (in the past and an few pockets now) in south india (eg among shrautins: [IMG](https://imgur.com/9mKPIOJ)).
- Widow remarriage / status.
    - UN report about widows left in vArANAsi : [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SxPv5aQP0c).
    - shatAvadhAnI gaNesh's view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXustFOkOr4&feature=em-uploademail) paints a sympathetic picture of such women before 1k years.

- Divorce
    - There is an ancient sanskrit word for divorce - a beautiful and very meaningful word. kauTilya uses it - mokSha. It is a simple misconception that there is no provision for divorce among hindu thinkers. \[[A1](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marriage/comprehensive-essay-on-divorce-in-india/4370/)\]

### Widower options
- "For a widower, at least four different options are suggested in the Dharmashastras. While Yajnavalkya Smriti (1.89) suggests the widower to take another wife without delay and rekindle a new fire (for religious Yajnas), texts like Baudhayana Dharmasutra (2.17.4) suggests one to renounce the world and become a Sannyasi. He may also rekindle the fire with a ‘substitute wife[10]’ made of gold or Kusha grass (Aitereya Brahmana 32.8; Trikandamandana 2.8) and thus enter Grihasta Ashrama symbolically and continue his duties, or he may rekindle the fire alone for himself[11] (Trikandamandana 3.128) and taking Shraddha (faith/conviction) as his ‘substitute wife’ may perform agnihotra etc. similar to those who remain unmarried (Naishtika Brahmachari). Thus, the four options for the widower are: remarriage, renunciation, taking a substitute wife in the form of statue made of gold or kusha grass for ritual purposes, staying as Apatnika by rekindling the sacrificial fire for oneself alone. ... Apatnikas are those who do not have dispassion and hence cannot take Sannyasa, but because of their love and attachment to their departed wives, they cannot even remarry. Either due to sorrow at the loss of the wife or due to desire to enter a Vanaprasta-like stage, the widower chooses the Apatnika path and practices Agnihotra etc. and lives a highly restrained life by cherishing the memory of the departed wife." - [Nithin](http://indiafacts.org/sati-dharmic-perspective/#_ednref14)

### Widow options
- Widow suicide - see [anugamana](../../violence/anugamana/) page
- "For a widow, on the other hand, Dharmashastras prescribe three different paths: Anugamana, Vidwavrata, and Punar-vivaaha[13]. While texts like Parashara Smriti (4.28-30) mention all the three paths, other texts mention only one or two options. ... Vidhwavrata, on the other hand, takes on elements from both Sannyasa and Apatnika paths of the widowers. ... Parashara Smriti (4.28) clearly allowing remarriage for women under five circumstances for Kaliyuga— if husband is missing, dead, has renounced the world, is impotent, or if he commits severe Adharmic actions— which pretty much covers all legitimate grounds; except for Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, no Dharmashastra writer or commentator has written much about widow remarriage. " - [Nithin](http://indiafacts.org/sati-dharmic-perspective/#_ednref14)


## anAshrama-flaw
- " one becomes Anashrami i.e. one without an ashrama, which is unhelpful to a person, since, Vishesha Dharma, or the righteous duties as contextualized to a specific individual is always defined with reference to varna and ashrama, and without an ashrama, one is unable to perform Dharma and hence will neither attain material welfare nor gain spiritual merit. It is for this reason, the state of “anashrama” is condemned in the Dharmashastras" - [Nithin](http://indiafacts.org/sati-dharmic-perspective/#_ednref14)

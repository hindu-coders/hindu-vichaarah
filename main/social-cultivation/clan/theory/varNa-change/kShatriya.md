## kShatriya-s in Kali age
### Parashurama and Nanda eliminations
- "The very basic question was whether there were any true Kṣatriyas alive during the Kali age. The questions were prompted by the Purānic story of the sage Paraśurāma having killed in revenge all the Kṣatriyas on the earth twenty-one times, and by the Purānic narratives that claimed that there will be no Kṣatriya dynasties after the Nandas [nandāntam Kṣatriyakulam], the precursors of the Mauryas in the 3rd century bc [tatahprabhr̥ti sūdrā-bhūpālā bhavisyanti, Viṣṇu Purāṇa, 4.24.21; also Bhāgavata-Purāṇa, 12.1.8-10]."
- "These stories were widely interpreted by the authors on the Dharmaśāstra to suggest that there were only two Varnas left in the Kali-age, the Brahmins and the śūdras. Everyone other than Brahmins is a śūdra \["kalāv ādyantayoh sthitiḥ", quoted in Kamalākarabhaṭṭa's śūdrakamalākara\]."

#### Exceptions
- Many were tales of kShatriya-s surviving parashurAma's slaughter. 
- ChandrasenIya-kAyastha-prabhu example: "When Parasurāma was killing all Kṣatriyas on earth in revenge, the pregnant queen of the king Candrasena took shelter in the hermitage of the sage Dālbhya. In pursuit, when Parasurāma arrived at Dālbhya's hermitage, he was pleased with Dālbhyas hospitality, and offered Dālbhya a boon. Dālbhya requested that the life of the unborn child of the queen of Candrasena who had taken shelter in his hermitage be spared. Parasurāma agreed to save the child on the condition that the child, though a born Kṣatriya, must not do the function of a Kṣatriya. This is how the CKPs became accountants, even though they claimed a Kṣatriya birth."


### Degenerate kShatriya concept
- "Kṣatriyas physically survived in the Kali age, but by non-performance of their initiation for generations patitasāvitrika, they reached a śūdra like state."
-  parAkhya-saMhitA - amadyapaḥ kulīnaśca, nityaṃ dharma parāyaṇaḥ | śūdraḥ kṣatriyavat jñeyaś, śeṣā nindyās tato bhṛśam ||

### Continuous saMskAra cases
In some cases, one may argue that despite stories of their elimination, some kShatriya clans survived and maintained an unbroken tradition of basic saMskAra-s. 

## HiraNyagarbha rite
- A kShatriya-wannabe could perform the hiraNyagarbha rite (atharva-veda-parishiShTa [13.2](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/2_paris/avpari_u.htm) morphed with regional anukalpa-s and paddhati-s).
- According to practice and paddhati-s, this involves offering up a golden calf (sometimes substituted by bronze as by vIrarAghava nAyaka).
- The yajamAna is popularly considered to have taken a second birth (parishiShTa clues - rājā hiraṇyagarbhatvam abhīpsaty asmin bhavanto 'numanyantām iti.  ).
- The phala is very general, according to the parishiShTa - whatever the brAhmaNa-s grant.

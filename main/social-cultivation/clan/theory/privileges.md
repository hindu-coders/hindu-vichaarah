title: Privilege contrast
---

- The dharma system was framed more in terms of duties than rights or privileges. This fundamental difference should not be forgotten. However, in modern debates, it sometimes becomes necessary to get an accurate picture of privileges that existed in practice.

### Crossing seas

- Also see ["India entry" page](../ethnic-shifts/Arya-consolidation//) for context regarding the fluid definition of AryAvarta.
- "There is a rule about ocean cross at least starting from an interpolated passage in bodhayana and you see the sentiment in later smritis. But it is not universal hindu practice."
- "Various brahmanas historically have done it and helped established hindu kingdoms in south east. They've composed mantra manuals of which few fragments survive - eg. khADgArNava fragments from Indonesia."
- "अस्माकमुदधिपारगतत्वमाकाशमार्गचारिणा वायुयानेनाऽभवन्न तु जलकपोतयानेन समुद्रसंयानेन वा  (कृष्णयजुर्वेदीयतैत्तिरीयशाखाया: बौधायनधर्मसूत्रेषु २.१.२.२. – “समुद्रसंयानम्” – अत्र विवरणव्याख्यानकर्तुः श्रीगोविन्दस्वामिनोऽभिप्राय: समुद्रयानेन/जलपोतयानेन द्वीपावान्तरयात्रायां पर्यवस्यति न त्वाकाशमार्गेण वायुयानेन) ।" इति केचित्।
- Plausible tales: "Pallavamalla narasimhavarmans pancaraatrin guru came from cambodia/malaysia by sea. The guru is depicted on walls of vaikuntha perumal temple. "

## Untouchability

The following classes of people / circumstances were subject to untouchability rules according to the smRti-s:

- A person who has committed a grave sin (mahApAtaka), but has not performed prAyashchitta.
- People whose spiritual practices were abhorrent to certain other people. Eg - bauddha-s jaina-s nAstika-s, even pAshupata-s and sAnkhya-s according to some texts.
- People following undersirable professions. Eg. a devalaka, a purohita for an entire village, hunter, butcher, fisherman etc..
- People in circumstances generating ashaucha. Eg.
    - Women in their periods.
    - A person shortly after a relative's death or a birth.
    - An uchChiShTa who is yet to wash his hands after/ while eating.
    - A person who has touched a corpse, but is yet to bathe.
- Certain races such as the mlechCha-s.

### Untouchable jAti-s

- There is no compelling evidence that untouchability existed in the Vedic Indo Aryan society.
- The smRti-s also do not recognize people the existance of people within the hindu society who were excluded from the 4 varNa-s and untouchable.

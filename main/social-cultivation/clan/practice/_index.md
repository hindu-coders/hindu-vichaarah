## Correspondence of theory with practice
- Frameworks always exist and make sense once defined - irrespective of how closely they were practiced. Whether or not one writes in the hindu decimal system, it exists. What matters to us (and the creators of the many many dharmashAstra works) is - how useful is the framework in \*organizing\* or systematizing the society to make it function smoothly.

## Overlay of varNa-s on jAti-s
- varNa-s were overlaid on/ mapped to many many pre-existing jAti-s (which could vary). These jAti-s and sub-jAti-s had their own hierarchies and restrictions on marriage and inter-dining beyond what the varNa-system required.
- These myriad jAti-s were hypothesized to have arisen from the main varNa-s mixing together in various ways.
- brAhmaNa-s learned in the dharmashAstra-s adjudicated disputes regarding varNa-assignment.
    - "On matters of dharma, including varNa and jāti, non-specialist administrative and legal functionaries of regional courts, lacking in Sanskrit knowledge, deferred to specialist Brahmins living in places like Paithan and later Banaras. Dalmia describes Banaras as a “supraregionally recognized” locus of juridical authority (Dalmia 1996: 322–3). The brahmasabhā would issue a decision, recorded in a document called a vyavasthā-patra (‘document (patra) bearing the decision (vyavasthā)’) or vijaya-patra (‘document spelling out the victory (vijaya) (of the authoritative claim"(siddhānta)’).169 The disputants would carry out the injunctions of this document, and their local political authority would not object." \[[AV2011](http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1088&context=ananya_vajpeyi)\]

## Education and jAti
- see background [here](../../intellect-sentiment/).
- In south India, shUdra courtezans like madhuravANI were highly learned in the shAstra-s and accomplished poets. ([SG1](https://youtu.be/xUdrbAZJCEk?t=275), [SG2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6mVQ_yn2s) ). Same with devadAsI-s.
    - "Sri Narayana Guru discusses how his Ezhava ancestors studied and authored medical texts in Sanskrit. Likewise, Balasaraswathi recounts that even 400 years ago, her ancestors from the Isai Vellaala caste (an MBC caste) authored treatises in music in Sanskrit and Tamil."  
- An account of education in early 1800-s in Bengal - [GB](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=FZcxAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA714).
- shUdra women (albeit princesses) did have excellent access to sanskrit. (eg. mallamma linked below).
- [Beuatiful tree](http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/beautifultree.pdf) pg 311: "The Vaidyas or medical tribe, and even some rich Kayasthas, are permitted to study such portions of Sanskrit literature as have been composed by wise men; but they are excluded from whatever is supposed to be of divine origin and authority. ".  

## shUdra challenges to hierarchy 
Abhinavagupta on varNavyavasthA : "कृतयुगे सत्त्वोत्कर्षबलादेव सर्वः स्वधर्ममनुपालयति । अद्यत्वे तु राजसत्वाच्छूद्रप्रकाराः करणादिजातीयाः सर्वेऽखर्वगर्वाक्रान्ता वर्णत्रयानुवृत्तिं न विदधते । शास्त्रं भवद्भ्य एवमादिशतीति च ते वचनमात्रेण नाद्रियन्ते । " (Natyashastra, chapter. 1)
    - "In the kRtayuga, everyone was dominated by the attribute of sattva and therefore performed his/her respective duties. But in these times, sub-castes among shUdra-s such as the karaNa are dominated by rajas. Gripped by excessive pride, they do not obey the other 3 varNa-s "This is what the shastra-s enjoin for you" - this, they acknowledge not even at the level of words."

## Sentimental life, rituals and Ananda pursuit
- This closely followed the theory described [here](../varna-theory/) (search term: Ananda).
- In some cases, brAhmaNa-s accepted non-brAhmaNa saints as honored gurus.
    - There are cases like a shrIvaiShNava brAhmaNa carrying a dalit on his shoulders so that he could visit the deva without violating temple rules, falling at their feet, insisting on eating food leftover after serving them ( [rAmAnuja](http://www.iskcontimes.com/archive/ramanuja-chides-his-wife) ).
    - madhusUdana-sarasvatI initiated many sannyAsins from other dvija-varNa-s with the intention of protecting brAhmaNa sannyAsins as suggested by bIrbal \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/WLSY6VL.jpg)\].
    - matsyendranAtha's 1k year old tradition initiates non-brAhmaNa sannyAsins as well.  

## jAti position relative to mlecCha-s
- mlecCha-s were in practice treated better than the lowest strata of the native society. This made sense since they brought with them military and economic power which hindus wanted to deal with, and since they were located outside India.
- This proved mal-adaptive when the mlecCha-s started living and breeding in the Arya lands. For example: A low-jAti person converted to a muslim or christian would be treated much better. This contributed to their increase in numbers. (../More [here](future/).)

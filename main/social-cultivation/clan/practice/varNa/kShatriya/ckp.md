title: CKP (Chandraseniya kAyastha-s)

## Support
- They claimed descent from kShatriya-s (see theory page) by a story which explained their functioning as accountants.
- Gāgābhaṭṭa allowed them the ceremony of Upanayana, only as a rite of passage (samskāra), but did not allow them the study of the Veda. There is a letter sent out by Raghunātha Paṇḍita, a minister of Shivāji, to the CKPs that refers to Anantadeva and Gāgābhaṭṭa and says that these great scholars had resolved the question of the Kṣatriyahood of the CKPs and their eligibility for Upanayana.

## Disagreement
- "Other Brahmins were not so sympathetic to the cause of the CKPs in later times. A series of documents from the Satara court of Shāhu, Shivāji's grandson, reveal how the issue erupted and, in spite of Shāhu's sympathy in favor of the CKPs, was for a while resolved against them under the pressure of a massive demonstration by the Brahmins of Pune, Vai, and Satara. With ten thousand Brahmins converging upon Satara, including representatives of Brahmins from Shringeri and Varanasi, the mass śāstrasabhā decided the issue against the CKPs. Here the documents refer to the story of Dālbhya, but with a new twist. The CKPs are made out to be the sons of a Dāsī of Dālbhya, and hence clearly belonging to the status of śūdras. The Karhada Brahmin, Mr. Athalye, who sided with the CKPs and represented their case at the court of Shāhu, was forced to undergo a prāyascitta "expiation" and admit his mistake."
- Referring to a number of such antecedents, Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa issued a stiff set of conditions on the behavior of the CKPs to which they were forced to agree in writing (katabā lihūn dila)-
    - We shall not perform any of our rites with Vedic mantras. Even if known, we will not utter the Vedic mantras. 
    - We will not make rice pindas during the srāddha. 
    - We will carry out the worship of Devi and other rites as per the Purāṇas. 
    - We will not invite Brahmins for a meal in our homes. 
    - We will not do sāligrāma-pūjā. 
    - We will worship only at those shrines where the śūdras worship. 
    - We will say dandavat to Brahmins. 
    - We will not employ Brahmin men and women as servants inside or outside of our homes. 
- "The surviving historical documents indicate to us the political-executive power that the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa put behind this decision. Vad (1911, 287 fr.) not only provides the text of the order issued by the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, he also gives a long list of 196 names of individuals and localities to whom copies of this order were sent and these individuals were advised that any violations of this order would lead to stiff penal ties. Without the backing of the executive authority of the Peshwa, the nirṇayapatra would have remained ineffective."

## Motivation
- "The CKP dispute at Shivāji's court appears to have arisen before the dispute regarding Shivāji's own eligibility for royal coronation."
- "It was Balāji Avaji Chitnis,[4] a CKP, who assisted Shivāji's search for his Rajput Kṣatriya roots by sending investigators to the north (cf. Shejwalkar 1964: 477; Sriśivadigvijaya, pp. 249 ff.), and, according to the Chitnis-Bakhar, it was Balāji Avaji who suggested to Shivāji that he invite Gāgābhaṭṭa in connection with the coronation. .. "
- "In the CKP documents, including the Citnis Bakhar, the role of Bālājī āvaji is somewhat exaggerated. It is not clear how much convincing Gāgābhaṭṭa needed from Bālāji Avaji. The Sabhāsad Bakhar attributes the initiative regarding coronation to Gāgābhaṭṭa himself.  If the date of the śyēnavi-jāti-dharma-nirṇaya of 1664 AD is valid, then Shivāji was already in touch with Gāgābhaṭṭa in such Dharmaśāstric matters."

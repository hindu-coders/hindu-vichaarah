## Vaidika ideals
The **vaidika ideals** (../deva-s, xAtra, dharma, brahman, yajna ... mentioned in [the intro](../../hinduism/introduction/)) easily lend themselves to the development of virile, yet harmonious and composite polytheistic **rAShTra**-s (states).
- The polycentric and adaptible vaidika ideals were quite acceptable to non-vaidika pagans.  

- Further, the sheer sophistication of the continually developing vedAnga-s and kala-s were very attractive to vedic and non-vedic pagans alike.  

## Ritualist conservative core
- Conservation of core vaidika ideas over millennia and across genepool-shifts involved evolution of a well-developed and influential ritualist caste (brAhmaNa-s) with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatical tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual.

## Attractiveness of the brAhmaNa-s  
- The brAhmaNa ability to hold and spread the attractive vedic ideals, and their tendency towards sophistication in the shAstra-s was very impressive. They were not initially limited by Ananda-addictions and (sea-faring type) taboos.
- Their sagely lifestyle had a charm to it. A brAhmaNa was ideally not to seek wealth - even via due fees for his yAjana \[aitareya brAhmaNa - [TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/926064678245150720)\].  
 
- Further, the brAhmaNa-s were mostly not a threat to the ruling elite (kShatriya or otherwise).

## Penetration and Aryanization
- The Aryan elite always included brAhmaNa-s. So, they initially spread with the Arya invasion.
- Elsewhere they freely migrated (often upon invitation), bringing with them the attractive vaidika ideals and practices.
- This facilitated the gradual Aryanization (= vedicization) of the host populations - even in the languages.
- This was accompanied by brAhmaNa-s additionally learning (and even mastering) the local  languages and practices - to the extant of becoming active in their preservation and flowering. Eg. brAhmaNa participation in early tamiL, kannaDa and telugu literature.  
- Later on, brAhmaNa-s would prove critical in resisting Christianity and Islam.

### Examples and analogies:
- Andhra
    - "Cynthia Talbot mined epigraphic records and labeled Vengi as the “core area” of Andhra in this period.5 Here again land grants to Brahmans were frequent and inscriptions indicate migrations from the north to Andhra. One copper plate records the donation of a village in Guntur District, west of the Krishna River, to one thousand Brahmans from the village of Ahicchatra on the Ganges." \["vedic voices" book\]
    - "Cynthia Talbot notes a special tradition in medieval Andhra, sapta-santana, “seven offerings,” by which donors could perpetuate their names.40 In addition to having a son, other legacies include provision of a deity image to a temple, constructing a tank for water supply, and donating an agrahara."   \["vedic voices" book\]
    - "Sriramapuram agrahara, established in 1940 in land grants to respected Veda pandits by a wealthy merchant, Dokka Rama, originally contained a single straight dirt lane of fourteen houses and a panca-ayatana (five-deity) temple housing Isvara, Radha-krsna, Surya, Ambika, and Vighnesvara (Ganesa)" \["vedic voices" book\]
- Cambodia \[kauNDinya dynasty [Q](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-link-between-the-Khmer-Empire-and-ancient-India), brAhmaNa priests' ceremonies [C05](https://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/priests-uphold-a-unique-and-royal-tradition-50637/)\]
- Bali.

#### Manipur: 
- "An ancient text reveals the migration of a  Brahman priest called Subinarayan from the west Tripura and his marriage with a  native woman, Haokei Chanu Thoinu. ... Almost all the Brahman priests, with the exception of a few of them, had migrated to Manipur without spouses. They married the local women generally from the lower social strata. ... They accepted Meiteilon (Manipuri language) as mother tongue. They were assigned varied yumnaks (lineages) based on their places of origin25 , professions, ways of life and so on."
- "Origins of Manipuri Brahmin (called Bamon in Manipuri): Adhikarimayum : WB, Sijagurumayum: Gujarat, Leihaothabam: Kanpur, Takhenchangbam: Sylhet (now in Bangladesh), Purailatpam: UP. They came during Kyamba's reign (2nd half of 15th century)" Source: RK Jhaljit, 1992
- "Brahmin immigration to Manipur in late 17th century: 1. Guruaribam: Puri 2. Laimayum: Tripura 3. Laipubam: Odisha 4. Hangoibam: Mathura 5. Hazarimayum: WB 6. Manoharmayum: WB 7. Mathurabasimayum: Mathura 8. Laimayumanoubam: Tripura 9. Choudhurimayum: Utkal " Source: RK Jhaljit.
- "... Another wave of Brahmins a. Aribam b. Samurailatpam c. Sanglakpam d. Hidangmayum e. Kongbrailatpam f. Thongratabam came during the 17th century in Khagemba’s time. ... Another wave of Brahmin came to Manipuri during Paikhomba’s reign in 2nd half of 17th century from Shrimayum: Gujarat, Bachaspatimayum: Banaras, Gurumayum Angom Lailatpam: Vrindavan, Brahmacharimayum: Prayag."

## Continual harmonization
- This penetration was likely accompanied by acknowledgement of kShatriya status of local lords. Late examples include: shivAjI, the hiraNyagarbha ritual for nair rulers.
- More widely, the brAhmaNa-s, through the evolving dharmashAstra-s and commentaries, tried to **harmonize** the functioning of the society - to bring order out of chaos. Thus they assisted the local lords in increasing local harmony.  

## National integration
- Besides patronage, brAhmaNa-s kept freely migrating and visiting various parts of hindu-dom in quest of mantra, shAstra and tIrtha.
- They carried with them news, lore and skills from one region to another.
- This facilitated a certain unity in spirit (../described in  [the intro](../../hinduism/introduction/)) throughout hindu abodes.
    - Example from Trinidad \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/Lsadw9y.jpg)\].
- Thus, it is no joke when one declares that without the brAhmaNa-s, there would be no India. Rather, we would have an unconsolidated set of tribes (as in most of America and Africa), ready to far more easily fall to the sword of the intolerant monotheistic blight.  
- "In terms of “soft power” the Indo-Aryan and Iranian religions were far more capable of imposing themselves on various east Asian peoples including the Mongols and Turks than vice-versa. Indeed, the religion of the Hindu even impressed itself on the Islamized Turko-Mongol tyrant Akbar in his later days. "

## Defence
"Unlike today, in the past it was an important factor for the survival of the Hindus. As the Greek observers remarked the brAhmaNa-s called upon the rulers repeatedly to unrelentingly keep fighting until all vestiges of Macedonian military presence were wiped out in northwestern India. Their cousins, the old Iranians were similar even though they were on the losing side. Long after Darius had fallen the zaotar Spitamanes of the clan of Zarathushtra was able to mobilize the Iranians in a fight unto death against the Macedonians."

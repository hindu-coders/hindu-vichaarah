## Enforcement
- "The surviving historical documents indicate to us the political-executive power that the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa p ehind this decision (about CKP-s). Vad (1911, 287 fr.) not only provides the text of the order issued by the Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa, he also gives a long list of 196 names of individuals and localities to whom copies of this order were sent and these individuals were advised that any violations of this order would lead to stiff penal ties. Without the backing of the executive authority of the Peshwa, the nirṇayapatra would have remained ineffective."
- "Religious authorities like the various śaṅkarācāryas also issued nirṇayapatras that began with a statement of the high standing of the office and ended with a stamp that reads mahānuśāsanam varīvarti." Example after a long list of adjectives: "srīguru-bhakti-parāyaṇeṣu sakalaśiśya-vr̥ndeśa-kalyāṇābhivardhakāśīḥ-purah-saram anuśāsanīyam idam."

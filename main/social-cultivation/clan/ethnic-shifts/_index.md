title: Settlement of India
---

## Initial hominid settlement
- Narmada cranial fragment is believed to be H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
- Exact date of modern human entry as well as the effect of the giant Toba volcano explosion on Indian hominid population is unclear. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
  - "Likewise, previous archaeological studies have recovered actual human fossils from only around 31,000 years (the Shri Lankan caves), though there are poorly studied assemblages of earlier stone tools from main land India."

## Pre-aryan human settlement
- There were early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. These old Indian HG tribes as can be seen above share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians. 
- IVC (see below) + IHG gave rise to ancestral south Indians (ASI) - prominent amongst whom were proto-Dravidians.

### IVC area
Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate).

- The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, may have been part of these people. \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]
- A prominent theory is that these people were referred to by neighboring civilizations as Meluḫḫa or Melukhkha (later giving rise to sanskrit mlecCha) \[[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha)\].

Other notes:  

- South Indian jAti distinctness predates Aryan arrival \[[NG](http://press.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/28/southern-india-caste-system-indo-europeans-genographic/#.UlnHJmsTfFw.twitter)12, [PLOS](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050269)\].

#### Language and script
The language and script of these people remains a mystery.
- Identification
    - Elamite of neighboring SW Iran is a strong candidate for a relative.
    - Others point to Dravidian and a proto Elamo Dravidian model (which is rather untenable - George Starostin [here](http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/elam.pdf)).
    - The Burushaski isolate is another candidate.
- Features
    - "karpAsa was indeed the Harappan word for cotton&shamali wood was also from that language. Also kInAsha: farmer, kulAla: potter, kaivarta: fisherman etc." \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]

## Dravidian bloom

- In the meantime, they met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes. 
- This is indicated  \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/725906932431613952/photo/1) [N16](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3559.html)\] by estimated time of L1 haplotype's blooming after the blooming of the R1a haplotype.
- **Cambodian example**. In this same manner they were to later influence South East Asia \[[Muj](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/504770071411961856)\]. ~5% of Cambodian ancestry seems to be Indian! \[[RK16](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-indian-ocean-as-humanitys-pond/#comment-1555053)\]
    - Its later fall was due to rise of Islam and rise of of the Viet at the expense of the Champa. The Tai warbands and many others were assimilated by Indics \[[RK16](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/genetics-as-thor-heyerdahls-revenge/)\]. 

## Islamic invasions
These seem to have left comparitively little genetic footprints. Partly because they are genetically very similar to the earlier Aryan influx - albeit more admixed with East asian markers.

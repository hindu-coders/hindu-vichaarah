## Initial peopling
- Indian hunter gatherers came first.
- Then the [iranian-farmer-invasion](iranian-farmer-invasion/)
- Then, Aryan migration/ invasion
- Then, Austro-Asiatic incursion
- [dravidian-bloom](dravidian-bloom/)
- Great Indo Aryan consolidations

## Islamic invasions
These seem to have left comparatively little genetic footprints even among muslims. Partly because they are genetically very similar to the earlier Aryan influx - albeit more admixed with Turkik markers.

## Summary blurp
- First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP.
- Then came early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G Are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. They represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians.
- Then came the Iranian farmer influx. Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate). The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, not to be confused with the later varNa, may have been part of these people.  Many of the middle and service castes are positions on this cline of Indian HG-IRF admixture and have a genetic heritage predominantly of this type. The supports the idea that the diversified service jAti-s typical of India developed in the Harappan system and continued relatively intact after the subsequent Aryan conquest of the land. The IVC language was not Dravidian, but went on to form the substrate of IndoAryan.
- Then came the Aryan invasion and consolidation. This likely happened in collaboration with a faction of IVC elites, some of whom were later incorporated in the highest echolons of Arya society. The soma cult, a distinct feature of I-Ir branch, might have come from them.
- Then came the male-biased Munda influx (likely via sea route into Orissa region) dated to be approximately around 3000 YBP with a lower bound of 3800 YBP.
- Then we have the Dravidian bloom. Harappans spoke a now lost/ subsumed language. In their southern borderlands were DR speakers who admixed with them and acquired some of the Harappan cultural elements. IA met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes. This is indicated by estimated time of L1 haplotypeâ€™s blooming after the blooming of the R1a haplotype.
- Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input.

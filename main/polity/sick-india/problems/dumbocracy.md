Here we examine problems of democracy and briefly consider alternative systems of government

## Problems
- The "one person one vote" paradigm prominent in democracies rests on an unnatural, false assumption: That all men are equal in their abilities and judgement.
- Politicians compete for attention and approval of masses (who in heterogeneous countries like India tend to be bottom heavy - ie dominated by incompetents). So, their legislative goals and administration becomes flawed.
    - "As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised."
- Political instability
    - this hinders general progress and business (which prefer stable guidelines)
    - This is exploited by our national and civilizational enemies.
- Short-termism
- Susceptibility to propaganda by manipulation of public opinion and opposition (see [subversion](../subversion/) page)
- Corruption
- Relatively more inefficient and harder to pivot.
    - No company (let alone successful ones) is a democracy. 

## General assessments
- "Machiavelli put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,[36] who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is far too late."

## Alternatives
- Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.

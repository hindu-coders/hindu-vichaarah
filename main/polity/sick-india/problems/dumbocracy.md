Here we examine problems of democracy and briefly consider alternative systems of government

## Problems
- Politicians compete for attention and approval of incompetent masses.
    - "As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised."

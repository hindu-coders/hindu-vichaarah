title: Way forward

Whatever works is far more important than what sounds cool.

## Long term
- Generally, our Abrahamistic (mostly muslim) brothers and sisters must be provided urgent help and treatment so as to rid them of their serious and dangerous memetic disease (more in the [treatment page](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/treatment/)).
So what can be done to maximize our chances of victory? What is in our hands? 
- We should clearly educate people (especially our families) about the nature of the dangerous memetic epidemic, the impossibility of long-term peaceful existence,  the urgent need to contain and treat the affected population. Our side should at least have as much clarity as the other side.
- Having studied examples like contemporary and historic China, Tajikistan, Tokugawa Japan, Erdogan, Putin and growing modern orthodox influence in Israel, we should position clear-headed folks in important branches of the government, military, and administration. When the time comes, they should be ready to act decisively to secure and consolidate power; before proceeding with the treatment program. In other words, filling such posts must be given far more prestige than working for fancy corporations.

## Medium term
Where Indian politics are concerned, as hindus, we favor ideas from the "center-right" in the short term. By "right", we mean the Hindu cultural right, not the Abrahamistic right or the "anti-socialist right".

### Take over BJP and co
- Necessary tactics for the future (from \[[KE](http://centreright.in/2014/08/the-modi-governments-hindu-agenda/#.U_Ndlj2x3Ua)\] article)
- "When American conservatives were dissatisfied with the wobbly unprincipled policies of the Republicans, they formed a conservative pressure group to influence Republican policy choices or get favoured Republican politicians elected. I am of course not recommending the contents of the Trotskyite or the Tea Party’s outlook, but their political tactic of creating a channel of focused pressure may be worthy of emulation."

### Corny hindutva as a slow watchdog
"This leads one to the simple conclusion that even though Hindutva may appear corny to the elite it is an upwelling of the India’s true spirit- the Americans know it and are trying to stanch it. The elite has to Hinduise or be disowned by India- no two ways about this. What is missing is a proper Hindu elite and a leadership emerging from it. So all Hindus should realize that Hindutva is doing the dog’s work of guarding the pasture. Rather than spit on the watch dog the elite must learn to work along with it, and not be subverted by the US or other external forces. The elite has to complement Hindutva rather than combatting it." \[[MT3](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/11/18/hindutva-ko-fek-do/), [TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/730240043902763008)\]

### Legislative ideas
#### Hindu ethos
- Examples
  - Israel example [here](http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.628365). 
  - Burma's "protection of race and religion" laws here.
- Stop favoring non-hindu/ anti-hindu religions, and unnecessarily controlling hindu affairs.  
- Temple control out of sickular government hands.
    - Karnataka has spent a mere 1/5 of the money it earned due to its management of hindu temples/ institutions for upkeep/ donation. The rest was assigned to Muslim and Christian institutions ([ES](http://www.esamskriti.com/essay-chapters/Why-must-temple-collections-be-controlled-by-the-Indian-Government-1.aspx)).
- Various cases of double standards by Indian courts should be curbed.
    - jalli kaTTu, dahi haNDi limitations vs ashura ([TW16](https://twitter.com/SirZaidHamid/status/786456228989919233)).
- This 2012 rioting bill with special treatment against the "majority" should be trashed.
- The Indian government, at long last, was ordered to stop providing [haj subsidies](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Muslim-leaders-welcome-Supreme-Courts-decision-to-abolish-Haj-subsidy/articleshow/13052845.cms/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=toionFB) to muslim pilgrims.
- Stop giving easy loans to people just because they are not Hindu-s.
- Hindu soldiers must be allowed to wear religious symbols. \[[N](http://wwrn.org/articles/13806/?&place=india&section=church-state)\]      
- Language
    - Transition towards use of Prakrits (at state level) and Sanskrit at national level for adminitration and governance (Carl's [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/sankrant1/language-policy-for-a-new-india-v1)).  
    - Imposition of local language on migrants and consequential regionalism are a huge drain on our human resources \[[MT16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/748000183108177921)\].

#### Containing abe's diseases
More specific steps are outlined below.
- The major defiled/ destroyed hindu temples may be legally and efficiently restored from the clutches of Islam.
    - somanAtha-shivAlaya (restored by the great sardAr vallabh bhAi paTel after 1947) and rAma-janma-bhUmI in ayodhyA (Dec 1991) are good starts.
- Article 370 which grants special statuses to J&K is scrapped.
    - Voiding the traty of accession is not such a big deal. If India must renegotiate it, it must strongly consider imposing it not withstanding the protests of the dominant tribes of kAshmIri muslims (as distinguished from rest of J&K population). They consider themselves an unwilling part of the union anyway; and it is not the supposed 'moral superiority' which is keeping India's control over the valley in reality.
    - Illegal immigration of Muslims from bAngladesh should be stopped.
        - Research shows that setting boundaries promotes peaceful coexistence \[[plos](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095660)\] (atleast until there's war to renegotiate the boundaries).
    - More [here](../demographics/).
- No Islamic preacher who endorses destruction of temples should be allowed into India.
    - 25k wahabi preachers from Arabia visited India between 2011 and 2014. \[[OI](http://www.oneindia.com/india/ib-vs-wahabi-the-war-against-saudi-funding-1791334.html)\]
- Ban and punish proselytization by Abrahamic religions.
- Muslim migrants to India must be granted citizenship - only if they convert to hindu-s.
    - Immigrants to Germany did this to claim chances of persecution if they return home \[[DA15](http://www.dawn.com/news/1204912/)\].


#### Fix internal divisions
- Stop special treatment for religious and linguistic minorities. Scrap article 30.
 
#### Miscellenia
- Efficient law enforcement.
    - Raise the number of policemen (at least) to UN recommended standards.

#### Environment protection.  
- See economics list below for mass transit etc..
- Reduce lead in water. \[[L](http://www.lead.org.au/lanv10n1/lanv10n1-5.html), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/BcGI2HK.png)\]

## Internal to hindu-s

- Inadequate cultural education and successful subversion by enemies
    - Self vs non-self discrimination
- Self-imposed dumbocracy
- Population and resource stress

### Bottom-heavy human resource
- Average IQ of 85-94. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/916514822430355457)\]
    - Comparison:

- "This leads to dilution of the high performers so they never cross the threshold for intensive sustained knowledge production over long periods. 2nd their efforts are ahead of their time or out of place for rest of population cannot really resonate with their innovations."
- "The low-end might also work against the advances of the highend & can easily be exploited as cannon fodder by the enemies."

### Regionalist identities
- On muslim demographics: Relatively higher muslim population growth rate is a threat to our hindu ethos.  
- Excess diversity in the wrong areas i.e. areas where diversity contributes to loss rather than gain in robustness. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/some-biological-analogies-for-certain-sociopolitical-issues/)\]
    - Eg. Scripts, regionalism.
- Regional rivalries can often be exploited by enemies of Hindus. Claiming to address genuine or imagined grievances, they can weaken the Hindu state. Example: "Dravidian" faultine and the Anglospheric interventions.
- Some prominent rivalries
    - tamiL nADu vs karNAtaka regarding the kAverI \[[2016 analysis](https://twitter.com/ainvvy/status/775687445719298048) \- stupid supreme court decision\]

### Racinomisia (= hatred of one's cultural roots)

#### Of the abrahamists

- See [here](../../../rivals/abe-disease/islam/intro/).

#### Of the Indian left

Yogindar Sikand's piece typifies the racinomisia-filled attitude of the "[Indian Left](http://www.countercurrents.org/sikand190412.htm)".

The mechanism and effects of this influence has been explored in detail in ["Breaking India: Western Interventions in Dravidian and Dalit Faultlines"](http://www.breakingindia.com/) by Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan.

## External to hindu-s
- Abrahamist subversion, tending towards eventual domination, in India
    - Faster abrahamist demographic growth.
- Foreign threats: China, TSP, TSB, West.
- Foreign polities: [subversion](../subversion/).

      <description>Stopping Abe&amp;rsquo;s diseases There is a good chance that we won&amp;rsquo;t come to our senses, overthrow dumbocracy and react with sufficient decisiveness in time - in which case, the sun will set on us just as it did on the Roman empire beset by the zombie cult. This is the &amp;ldquo;gone with a whimper&amp;rdquo; (worst) case, whose prognostication we may observe in the Kerala and W Bengal. This is a serious possibility, and the Gods have not granted idiots immunity from extinction.</description>

      <description>Hindu ethos  Examples  Israel example here. Burma&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;protection of race and religion&amp;rdquo; laws here.   Stop favoring non-hindu/ anti-hindu religions, and unnecessarily controlling hindu affairs. Temple control out of sickular government hands.  Karnataka has spent a mere 1/5 of the money it earned due to its management of hindu temples/ institutions for upkeep/ donation. The rest was assigned to Muslim and Christian institutions (ES).   Various cases of double standards by Indian courts should be curbed.</description>

## Judging non-superficially
Let us put it this way – with “Skin in the game” to keep it real. Even an impartial neutral non-hindu atheist might see the point.

Would one, as a father of two young Hindu girls, want to live in the midst of a muslim neighborhood (punjabi, bangla, moplah, kashmiri take your pick)? A burmese buddhist neighborhood? A Balinese Hindu neighborhood? A vietnamese buddhist neighborhood?

I mean – The muslims can eat all of the same chicken Tikka masala and the Vietnamese can eat all the cocroaches they catch. But, at the end of the day, what matters far more are some shared gurantees and outlook. In other words, “more in common” is not a simple average – but a weighted complex mean.

To quote Ambedkar : “Indeed, there is more spiritual unity between Hindustan and Burma than there is between Pakistan and Hindustan. And if the Hindus did not object to the severance of Burma from India, it is difficult to understand how the Hindus can object to the severance of an area like Pakistan, which, to repeat, is politically detachable from, socially hostile and spiritually alien to, the rest of India.”

## Neo-pagan case
### Demographics
- "The burgeoning neo-pagan movement in the West has a very hard divide between the racists and the super left."

### Joining factors
- Polytheism
- Rivalry and fight for survival against Monotheisms (esp. Islam, Christianity)
- Shared respect for nature, naturalism.

### Dividing factors
- Illustrations - see [#phDiscord](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23phDiscord&src=typed_query&f=live).
- Denouncement of RSS and Hindutva. Insistence on secularism. Support for muslim rights.
- Spirited subscription to extreme liberalist causes and views. The underlying [memetic framework](../ingestion/memetic framework) is incompatible.
  - General SJW tendencies and demand for conformity.
  - "Gender is a social construct"
  - "Race is a social construct"
  - Anti-nationalism
  - Normalization of sexual deviance.
- Jealousy and peevishness about having an inferior survival track-record.

## Division of power, scale-free feudalism.

Consider the list of individual heroes involved in politics and war. Thence we learn the following. Where ever kShatriyas tasked with protecting their land (as if it were their wife) and subjects (as if they were their children) fell, others rose to take their place (eg: harihara and bukka, chandragupta maurya, shivAji, reDDi chieftains). They were guided and inspired by learned men and sages (eg: tukArAm, vidyAraNya, chANakya). Further, their efforts were financed often by taxation, but also sometimes by donations from merchants. This division of power (in the form of occupation specific jAti-s) lent to the civilization the character of a multi-headed snake - chop one head off, another takes its place.

MT [says](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/): "the sAmanta-maNDala system, far from being a form of feudalism that undid the Indians, provided them with an intrinsic robustness that allowed them to counter the Moslems once the top layers of the scale-free structure had been knocked out." panchAyata of a village -> sAmanta in a nagara -\> mahAsAmanta -> king.

## Resistance to alien invasions and resurgence .

- Constant low level pesant revolt against muslim rulers was noted by Peter Mundy, Manucci, Abul Fazl, Bernier, Jahangir, Kopf. (sItA-rAm-goel's assessment [here](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm).

### (Dis)Unity

#### Effective disunited resistance

Very strong resistance to foreign invasion has been repeatedly observed. With regard to the Muslim invasions, it must be noted that for over a 1000 years, there was on average 1 battle every month between local resistors and Islamic armies. Even as proud civilizations from Iran to Indonesia fell, the native Hindu culture survived. Earlier invaders, such as the shAkas, huNas, yavanas were similarly checked. Empires such as the paramAras, the vijayanagara empire, the marATha empire repeatedly checked for many centuries, and were beginning to reverse Islamic invasion. Like the European crusades launched to conquer Palestine, similar efforts began to be observed late in the 18th century with the marATha and sikh confrederacies.

The above negates the common accusation of abject failure in the face of invaders.

#### Lack of a united fronts against invaders

Fragmentation of the land of the Arya-s (and more broadly pagans) into several competing polities resulted in these kingdoms short-sightedlyworking against their pagan neighbors by:

- allying with barbarians (eg. Islamic and Christian invaders)
    - " In this sterile statecraft, centred on the politics of the maNDalayoni, one�s neighbour was always an enemy, and the enemy of an enemy always a friend! Hindu princes, therefore, failed to hang together in the face of a common calamity. In the event, they were hanged separately." \[[SRG](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm)\]
- taking advantage of a kingdom's conflict with barbarians to attack it. Examples -
    - someshvara and co killing bhojarAja (who had undertook great expeditions against the muslim invasion) in battle.
    - the gajapati ruler relentlessly scheming against his own son-in-law kRShNadevarAya, even as the latter was quarrelling with bahmani sultanates.
- fearing to send troops to aid kingdoms being attacked by barbarians, for the fear that their pagan neighbors will take advantage of the weakness.

#### Powerful empires/ frederations

The severe drawback from not having a united front against invaders was keenly felt by luminaries who faced the mlecCha-s such as chANakya (who did not see much promise in the gaNa city-states), mAdhava vidyAraNya, rAmadAsa (perhaps just as even kRShNa considered his yAdava-gaNa). So, at times of need, powerful empires did form and they proved to have a greater impact in resisting invaders (eg. mAurya-s under chandragupta, gupta-s under vikramAditya, marATha-s, to some extant sikha-s). Yet, to the extant these frederations had \*hindu\* competitors, they paid the usual fragmentation penalty.

### Taking the battle into alien lands

"The second need of the situation was a forward policy which would have taken the war into the heartland of Islam, instead of being fought over the length and breadth of Bharatavarsha. But the Hindus during this period were afflicted by a fortress psychology. They waited for the invader till he arrived at Panipat, or shut themselves into citadels which could be stormed or starved into surrender while the unprotected populace outside was slaughtered. Nor did they ever pursue and destroy the invader even when he was defeated and made of flee. If the Chaulukyas of Gujarat had pursued and destroyed Muhammad Ghuri and his hordes when he was defeated by them in his first expedition in 1178 AD, he would not have come back to Tarain in 1191 AD. Again, if the Chauhans had pursued and punished Ghuri after his defeat in the first battle of Tarain, there would have been no second battle of Tarain, and perhaps no more Muslim invasion of India, at least for some time to come. The effectiveness of a forward policy was demonstrated first by the Marathas under Shivaji, and later on by the Sikhs under Banda Bahadur. But that was against an Islamic state already established in India." \[[SRG](http://www.voiceofdharma.org/books/siii/ch9.htm)\]

  

#### Falling for temple blackmail

al-masUdI: “When the unbelievers march against mUltAn, and the faithful do not feel themselves strong enough to oppose them, they threaten to break their idol, and their enemies immediately withdraw”. Another writer (this one from persia), al-ishtakhri also mentions the same state of affairs regarding the defense of the city against hindu invaders. The self proclaimed butshikan-s were forced to take refuge behind the famous ‘but’ of their capital to retain their kingdom.

  

Counterexamples

- shivAji's resisting attempts by afzal khan and shaiste khan to rouse him to rashness by temple destruction.

## Adaption of military technology and tactics

Horse problem - Ancient and mideval sources (shAlihotra, sAyaNa) acknowledged the importance of horses in military success. \[[Tw](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/679471919507320835)\]

  

Muskets and the firing line were adapted early. \[Inquiring [post](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/28/handguns-in-hindu-military-why-the-slow-adoption/).\]

Adaption of European advances in tactics and weaponry was only partial - [Gordon 98 pdf](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67903/10.1177_001946469803500301.pdf?sequence=2).

  

## Misplaced mercy and lack of ruthlessness

One drawback we hindus had was misplaced generosity - a paucity of ruthlessness. The source is nothing but moral weakness and fragility. These people want approval and admiration of others. This is the disease that motivated moronic actions right from dharmarAja to PrithvirAja Chauhan to Nehru and Gandhi.

- Think what kind of disaster it would have been if kRShNa thought that way. That yudhiShThira gave duryodhana his choice of weapon and combatant when he emerged from the lake hiding spot, and kRShNa scolded him - "Again, even now you are gambling! A deceitful person should be destroyed with deceit without this kind of show." Alas! this consciousness found in bhIma and kRShNa turned out to be so rare!

### Not expelling Islam

Unlike spanish reconquista or the jApanese expulsion of christianity, various hindu empires did not mostly expel Islam from their conquered lands. This was a huge cumulative mistake.

## Failures.

Why did we loose to the British in the end, just as we were beating back Islam? MT's analysis [here](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/).

Not learning from history, misplaced mercy (The likes of Malik Kafur, Md Ghori being released after defeat). Insufficient ruthlessness in facing the Islamic threat (not taking adequate steps at suppressing Islamic ideology, once the enemy states were defeated).  

- Bharatendu's [account](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/13/mana-simha-the-rashtrakuta-ii/) of the differing conditions of the Hindu kings vs the East India Company. 

Traitors aplenty.

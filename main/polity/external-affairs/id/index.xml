      <description>Nationalist/ pro-hindu-cultural sentiment and awareness of the mlechCha (including muslim) invasion and threat is evident in many places.
Extant of old AryAvarta  The notion of a fluid but temorally clear definition of the land of Arya-s (../AryAvarta) is apparent from the dharmashAstra-s. More in the ethnic-shifts/Arya-consolidation/ page. baudhAyana lists sea voyage among patanIya-s. manu says that a brAhmaNa who has crossed the seas is not worthy of being invited to a shrAddha.</description>

      <description>Intro  See &amp;ldquo;equality fallacy&amp;rdquo; section of nAstika ID page for background. Kanchi MahasvamI produced foolishness that claimed crazy stuff such as &amp;ldquo;all religions are the same&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ramses and rama are related&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;aztec is probably a corrpution of Astika&amp;rdquo; etc.. (1).  But, a mitigating factor: &amp;ldquo;the AchArya was not a svayaM-devatA-vAdin &amp;amp; upheld the deva-dharma sincerely despite certain serious idiosyncratic misapprehensions&amp;rdquo;.   Criticism  Swami Aksharananda (Guyana) here.    nAtha-sampradAya  &amp;quot; Of the 13 Nath sub-orders, I understand the Rawal or Nagnath order of Punjab consisted of Muslims though it traced its ancestry to Shiva.</description>

      <description>General patterns  See &amp;ldquo;equality fallacy&amp;rdquo; section of nAstika ID page for background. For a few supposed miracles, they compromise the immune strength of their society.  Idiot bAba veneration  Hindus venerate many charismatic idiot bAba-s. Sai bAba has been described as a chisti-lineage sUfi (they have strong jihAdi background). He lived in Khuldabad, which was a chisti centre. Yet, he is also popularly venerated many parts of India as nAtha shaiva, rAmabhakta, recited bhagavadgItA, dattAtreya bhakta, dattAtreya himself etc&amp;hellip; The devotees have come up with a yantra, gAyatrI mantra &amp;amp; even homapaddhati for fakir baba.</description>

      <title>Reconversion</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/polity/external-affairs/id/reconversion/</link>

      <guid>https://hindutva.github.io/main/polity/external-affairs/id/reconversion/</guid>
      <description>Hindu law:  Reconversion to the hindu ethos was codified in the devala-smRti [PVK_IMG1, TW17] and Vignaneswara’s commentary to Yagyavalkya Smriti [S].  Risks from converts While Hindus get all excited (and rightly so) about foreigners taking to their religion; one must note that foreign converts to Hinduism bring with them significant risks - so, caution is appropriate:
 Malhotran U-turn: The convert learns some Hindu tattva or technique, faces some social pressure to return to original bearings, repackages the H tattva or technique in Christian/ Jewish terms.</description>

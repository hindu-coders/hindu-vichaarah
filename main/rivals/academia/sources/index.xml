      <title>Bungling</title>

      <description>Gross bungling of primary sources  interpreting them in crazy ways. Eg. Sheldon Pollock [YT17]  Severe lack of contextual knowledge  leading to crazy (yet vehement) extrapolations. The typical indologist&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of (even modern, let alone ancient) India can be silly, condescending and demeaning? Just take this recent example.  &amp;ldquo;Intellectual yet idiot&amp;rdquo; phenomenon  More here.  </description>

      <title>Civilizational bias</title>

      <description>Abrahamist bias  Political sympathies, and the victor writes history phenomenon. Examples elsewhere  Junipero Serra canonization G2015.    Islamophilia  Criticizing Islam means criticizing their own Christian past - fundamental problems are the same. To modern Europeans, the fundamental evils of intolerant Abrahamisms (Eg. Banu Quraiza massacre) are abstract concepts, as are Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno and the emperor Julian. The Aurangzebs, Mahmuds and Aladins (ie their early Christian equivalents) of Europe are about as abstract as the forgotten Roman Gods.</description>

      <title>Dry scholar problem</title>

      <description>Intro  So, the representation of Hindu traditions by dry scholars tends to be maddeningly flawed (whether in their textbooks, books or talks). Practitioners on the other hand are more reliable. But a *scholarly practitioner* is the best. This is the difference between शुष्क-पण्डितता and आर्द्रमना ऋषिः.  Analogies: How valuable (to insiders or outsiders) are books about making Indian music or dancing, if written by one who does not do either?</description>

      <description>Enemy agency  &amp;ldquo;Western Academics who work on Indian Religion, literature, culture, philosophy etc generally get what little knowledge they have of Indian society and politics from politics and sociology departments bankrolled by Pakistan and the Middle east that talk about India in terms of poverty, oppression, and sectarian violence- unlike category a here, who when they get a grant for a year get 30,000-40,000 to go do fieldwork in india, people in poli sci or economics or sociology at the top of their field get 100,000+ grants to go do their work and then get published in journals bankrolled by the house of saud etc- their articles (in addition to being read by academics trying to learn something about &amp;ldquo;modern india&amp;rdquo;) end up incorporated into briefings for state dept officials and so forth&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Find inter-school rivalries &amp;ldquo;What do we understand by contextualizing the texts? Lineal conflicts and personal attacks that developed into prolonged clashes between the gurukulas, for instance. And the scribal errors purported to be as such but purposely employed devices to alter meaning or variants resulting from the popularity of the text in vernacular traditions. Even beneath an ostentatious eulogy, we may decipher a lamentation if carefully gone against the grain by following the paronomastic hints or “slesharthas“.</description>

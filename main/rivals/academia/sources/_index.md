- Academic arrogance and rigid unwillingness to change wrong opinions.

## The general dry-scholar vs practitioner problem

## The nature of the "social sciences" academic establishment
- "They also know that holding (or at least uttering) the required opinions can make or break an academic career: either formally, as when a non-Anglican could not get admission to Oxford University, or informally, as under the reign of progressivist conformism today. To think highly of the academic world presupposes a link between scientific achievement and academic rank, and this largely makes sense in the exact sciences. In the humanities, especially in the social “science” and literature departments, this link is also deduced, but only as a parasitical extension of the conventions in the exact sciences. Much of what passes for scholarship these days is only ideology wrapped into jargon." \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

## Inherent flaws in the philological methodology
- the scholar tries to imagine the historical and social context prevelant at the time of composition of a text \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/edQr4IJQuEg?t=428)\]
- rAjIva malhotra says that sheldon pollock and co have invented "political philology" - "A central argument he advocates with evangelical zeal is that Indian texts must be studied not for legitimate spiritual/sacred content, but for the purpose of finding the social exploitation and political domination contained in them. Before he can show the texts to be political, he has to devalue (and debunk) the legitimacy of the sacred dimension; then he can substitute the political motive as the reason for the successful spread of Sanskrit. ...  If one side of the coin of Pollock’s interpretation is political philology, the other side is liberation philology. ... While political philology is used to diagnose, liberation philology is used to liberate the Indian masses from the diseases being carried in their sanskriti for thousands of years." 

## Gross bungling of primary sources
- interpreting them in crazy ways. Eg. Sheldon Pollock \[[YT17](https://youtu.be/vaRCmUwpmNk?t=334)\]

## Severe lack of contextual knowledge
- leading to crazy (yet vehement) extrapolations.
- The typical indologist's evaluation of (even modern, let alone ancient) India can be silly, condescending and demeaning? Just take [this](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-March/042887.html) recent example.

      <description>Appropriation of texts and traditions  Johannes Bronkhorst: &amp;ldquo;There are no ancient texts that “belong” in any essential sense to the tradition that identifies with it. The Mahabharata “belongs” as little to modern Hindus as the Bible “belongs” to modern Christians. Historical scholarship cannot be steered by modern groups that have appropriated the texts they are studying.&amp;rdquo; The abrahamist scaffolding may be nearly impossible to completely overcome. Example: Mark Dyzchowski (TW1)  The charge of native neglect  Aka White-man&amp;rsquo;s burden to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; Indian/ hindu studies.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Sanskrit for Computational Linguistics &amp;quot; - &amp;ldquo;Their research in the subdomains such as knowledge extraction and knowledge structure identification from resources, text to speech conversion and vice versa, identification of mathematical elements in Sanskrit grammar, and development of tools for analysing and producing Sanskrit texts are literally revolutionizing our existing understanding of Sanskrit including the ways we teach and learn this pleasantly recondite language and associated branches of knowledge. &amp;quot; (&amp;lt;&amp;ndash; That this is a distinctive feature of western Sanskrit scholarship is a misrepresentation.</description>

      <description>Caren Dreyer called for blacklisting shrI Kutumba Sastry because he signed the anti-Pollock petition (IN16)  &amp;ldquo;Dear all, isnt it time for an alphabetical blacklist to be regularly updated in order not to invite the wrong persons financed by public funds &amp;ldquo;.   Attacks on Rajiv Malhotra, who, despite some defective scholarship, has written books that attempted to spur hindu resistance and awareness towards foreign (academic/ evangelical/ political) subversion.</description>

      <title>Hindutva vilification</title>

      <description>One can observe within and without social media how people vilify hindutva (for example by sharing such rot [insert link]). They will do everything they can to make 卍 look like 卐. One must ask oneself how much one&amp;rsquo;s welfare coincides with theirs.
The tactics a typical western politically active indologist (eg. Sheldon Pollock) uses are-
 He plays bad cop when it comes to an assertive and virile hindu civilization.</description>

      <title>Misrepresentation</title>

      <description>What is the core? Not the likes of the following, since hindus themselves make many such mistakes:
 Ridiculous translations from the Clay series brought out by Mr Pollock and co, arising from shaky grounding in Indian thought - TW16.  Consequences  These dry/ context-free scholars have tended to influence (very actively or otherwise) how Hindu traditions are summarized or presented to Hindus and non-hindu-s alike. Eg. The California case.</description>

      <title>Negationism</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/rivals/academia/charges/negationism/</link>

      <guid>https://hindutva.github.io/main/rivals/academia/charges/negationism/</guid>
      <description>(Such negationism should be equal to &amp;ldquo;holocaust-denial&amp;rdquo;.)
Examples  In the Ram Mandir/ Babri masjid case, several &amp;ldquo;scholars&amp;rdquo; made shoddy claims. Several scholars such as Llewelyn Morgan [KE] and Eaton (Koenraad Elst&amp;rsquo;s Eaton rebuttal) have been temple-destruction deniers. Note: at 38:01 in this National Geographic documentary, they say: &amp;ldquo;These statues did not loose their heads by accident&amp;hellip; What the Hindu priests started, muslim invaders completed.&amp;rdquo; Equating Hindu priests and Muslim invaders is vile deception.</description>

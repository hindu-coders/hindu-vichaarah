      <description>Principle  Even if greater disengagement from western indology results in less vigorous study of hindu past in the short term, it will at least be on strong foundations. Genuine and honest Hindu/ sanskrit scholarship does not need the shelter of academia to emerge.  There are religious institutions, rich circles of connoisseurs form around local experts in the shAstra-s.    Examples of foolish engagement  Bad funding: Various idiot rich hindu-s funding sanskrit/ hindu chairs and projects which are liable to be under the influence of anti-hindu academics.</description>

      <title>Limitations on this critique</title>

      <description>This is not to deny the positive contribution and truly objective scholarship of some western academics towards the understanding of Hindu past and Hindu nationalism. Yet, we Hindus have shown ourselves to be internally capable of doing all this, and the subversive actions do stand out as a liability. Western academic setup also includes Indians trained in and beholden to that system. This list does not excuse shoddy research, bad presentation and bad behavior by some Hindu-s.</description>

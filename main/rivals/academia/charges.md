"I increasingly see "Indology" as a Western (ie Christendom's) defense against the impact of Indian thought which was being felt in late 18th-early 19th c." - Edward Butler.  

## Context

- The purpose of this list is to note the reasons why Hindus must engage with Western Indology with great caution.
    - AIDS tells us that a compromised immune system can be a fatal liability.

### Limitations on this critique

- This is not to deny the positive contribution and truly objective scholarship of some western academics towards the understanding of Hindu past and Hindu nationalism. Yet, we Hindus have shown ourselves to be internally capable of doing all this, and the subversive actions do stand out as a liability.
- Western academic setup also includes Indians trained in and beholden to that system.
- This list does not excuse shoddy research, bad presentation and bad behavior by some Hindu-s.

Indology failed not from the perspective of Indian tradition, which has continued largely unaffected. Neither did it fail from the perspective of Sanskrit, which produced a wealth of literature, which anyone today can read and which will exist long after the last Indologist. 

Indology failed from the perspective of the claims
it itself asserted: science, university discipline, humanities, European tradition, and history. 

- (1) Indology is not a science; neither did Indologists have any clue of what “science” is.
- (3) Indology failed to contribute to the humanities, especially if we regard the cultivation of aesthetic sensibility, broad-mindedness, openness to other cultures, humility, ethics, etc. as the goal of humanities education.
- (4) Most Indologists are ignorant of broad movements in European intellectual history and  philosophy; they keep telling themselves they are important and European, but this posture only works in front of Indians.
- (5) Indologists are ignorant of their own history: for all that they propagate the idea of Indology as a “historical-critical” discipline, they failed to engage in either historical self-reflection or self-critique. Ultimately, this is the real reason Indology failed as evinced by the rapid closure of departments.
  - (2) No one at German universities recognizes Indology; despite belaboring the parallel with classical philology, Indologists are figures of ridicule to classicists.

### Machine to presume authority on hinduism
- From [SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/much-ado-about-plagiarism-fox-vs-malhotra/): " It is not so much Malhotra, the scholar, who is worrisome to them as Malhotra, the strategist. Among the Hindus, he appears to be the first who has approached the Western academy as a knowledge-producing ‘industry.’ At least this is what I have gathered from his speeches and writings. Just like any company which builds and markets a product, the Western academy is in the business of generating and selling certain narratives. The knowledge of other cultures is collected as “raw data” from its native informants who subsequently do not play much of a role in its interpretation. This data is then subjected to hermeneutical processes based entirely on Western theories. The end result undergoes critical review processes and is packaged with notes, cross-references, bibliographies, the whole she-bang, to produce a ‘representation’ which is then admitted as authoritative knowledge on the particular subject both in the West and tragically in the host country as well."

## Attempt to silence critics

- Caren Dreyer called for blacklisting shrI Kutumba Sastry because he signed the anti-Pollock petition ([IN16](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-March/042862.html))

- Attacks on Rajiv Malhotra, who, despite some defective scholarship, has written books that attempted to spur hindu resistance and awareness towards foreign (academic/ evangelical/ political) subversion.
    - 2015 attempt to spur withdrawal of Rajiv Malhotra's books from the market due to overblown plagiarism charges (a few missing and mistaken attributions). \[[SW15](http://swarajyamag.com/culture/much-ado-about-plagiarism-fox-vs-malhotra/)\]
        - "he amply quoted him in so many words, though a few times, for the flow of the narrative, he merely rephrased the theses of this much-quoted author. By that standard, most papers contain plagiarism; but what passes unnoticed elsewhere becomes a scandal when done by a self-identifying Hindu. Yet, numerous Indologists started a holier-than-thou tirade against the “plagiarism”, a comical drama to watch. Malhotra then walked the extra mile writing Nicholson out of his narrative and quoting original sources instead (thereby incidentally showing the amount of plagiarism that Nicholson himself had committed, though no Indologist ever remarked on that). But this inconvenient development was given the silent treatment, and Truschke still presupposes that there ever was a substantive “plagiarism” case against Malhotra, and by extension against the whole “Hindu Right”. ... By contrast, Malhotra, by personalizing his argument into specific dissections of the work of leading scholars such as Wendy Doniger, Sheldon Pollock or Anantanand Rambachan, has earned a session at the annual conference of the trend-setting American Academy of Religion. On Indological discussion forums, his input is frequently mentioned, though the academics mostly keep up their airs of pooh-poohing that interloper, in a bid to justify their ignoring his actual critique of their own work."  \[[KE16](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]
        - Petition against the books was started by Jesse Knuston, a Sanskrit professor and collaborator with Sheldon Pollock \[[C15](https://www.change.org/p/harper-collins-india-in-view-of-the-widespread-plagiarism-found-in-rajiv-malhotra-s-book-indra-s-net-published-by-harper-collins-india-we-call-on-the-publisher-to-make-a-formal-public-apology-and-to-withdraw-the-book-from-the-market?recruiter=5167386&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&utm_term=des-lg-no_src-custom_msg&fb_ref=Default), [N](http://www.niticentral.com/2015/07/15/rajiv-malhotra-on-hindu-intellectuals-niti-exclusive-323900.html)\], with inputs from Richard Fox Young, (Christian seminary professor and collaborator with John Dayal) and  Ananya Vajpeyi. The movement drew support from with ad-hominem attacks by Robert Goldman as well ([BVP](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/3WjZziSAEGo), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/G3uT0Iu.png)).

    - In other threads (references to be added), Koenraad Elst has described the professional cost of his pro-hindu stance.
        - "In the 90s I have worked a lot on Islamic history, I had studied Persian and made good use of it.. And incidentally, two of my MA diplomas include courses on historical method. ... But I admit, he is far better at lobbying and belongs to a circuit that has very successfully blocked my access to the academy. When you have lost the battle on contents, at least you may win on the institutional front... Most of them (my papers) are (published in academic journals). But the question is typical for people who are status-conscious raher than knowledge-conscious. As you should know by now, the secularist camp has done all in its power to deny me academic employment or avenues of publication." - In response to a certain Conrad Barwa who resorted to name-calling, and questioning his scholarly credentials.
        - "A recent example. In 2014, I read a paper on the Rg-Vedic seer Vasishtha and his relative divinization in a panel on “divinization” at the European Conference for South Asia Studies in Zürich. My paper was enthusiastically received, also by the panel’s organizers when I sent in the final version for publication. First, they accepted it, but then, I received an embarrassed e-mail from the organizers stating that they could not include my paper, without any reason given. Upon my enquiring, the half-line reply said that it did not fit their project. In all its insignificance, this still managed to be a blatant lie, and their earlier acceptance confirmed that this could not have been the reason. But some higher up had warned them that I am to be treated as excluded, just like on many other occasions." \[[PR](http://www.pragyata.com/mag/academic-bullies-278)\]

### Funding the journals and institutes
- "Western Academics who work on Indian Religion, literature, culture, philosophy etc generally get what little knowledge they have of Indian society and politics from politics and sociology departments bankrolled by Pakistan and the Middle east that talk about India in terms of poverty, oppression, and sectarian violence- unlike category a here, who when they get a grant for a year get 30,000-40,000 to go do fieldwork in india, people in poli sci or economics or sociology at the top of their field get 100,000+ grants to go do their work and then get published in journals bankrolled by the house of saud etc- their articles (in addition to being read by academics trying to learn something about "modern india") end up incorporated into briefings for state dept officials and so forth".
- Reg. ISKCON counteraction \[[AC16](https://www.academia.edu/11637543/Asymmetrical_Religious_Commitments_Religious_Practice_Identity_and_Self-Presentation_among_Western_Scholars_of_Hinduism_and_Buddhism)\] 
  - International Journal of Hindu Studies is basically run by them- Journal of Vaisnava Studies is actively run by them
  - Oxford Journal of Hindu Studies and Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies gets all their money from them.
  - that leaves Journal of Indian Philosophy, History and Culture of South Asia (Oxford), and things like Indo-Iranian journal.

## White-man's burden to "save" Indian/ hindu studies.

### The charge of neglect

- Plenty of Indians agree that the claim that "Value of knowledge by Indians is zero or close to zero." is false. The life of every practicing hindu still places high value on knowledge of traditional hindu knowledge (including performance arts, ritual, music, stories, philosophies).
    - Sanskrit revitalization is an example of a major grassroots movement in this direction.
    - There are plenty of people who attain privately mastery of shAstra and kAvya solely due to their love of those topics and a strong desire to put what they see into practice, not to show how smart they are. These are nourished within private circles centered around local masters in the topic (R Ganesh and his fellow avadhAnin-s jump to mind as an example). This is how it ought to be, and it is healthy. A far cry from the academic knowledge industry. A supposed scholar of kAvya who cannot and has not composed a kAvya is a fraud. Not worth a cent, let alone millions of dollars.
- It is a continuation of "white man's burden" that many Indologits wants to provide the opposite impression (that Indians commonly think that the value of such knowledge is close to zero).
    - Examples: Sheldon discusses in [SP12:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=12m00s) Obviously false, and  Of course, the value as he describes in [40:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=40m00s) and [55:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV3bfxR9Ic0&t=55m00s) are quite innately accepted by hindus as well.
- What these aliens consider "vitally important" (often for the purpose of their livelihood, though hypocritically masked in terms of grander purposes) is not necessarily that important to hindus.
- If Indian government and education system does not value such knowledge, it is precisely because of the value system that Sheldon represents - where "secularism" (a post-christian christian virtue which is meaningless and even poisonous for pagans) and "study without practice" (the dry end of the dry-scholar/ practitioner/practitioner-scholar spectrum)  reign supreme.
- While Indian education system has its problems, there are quite a few Sanskrit universities and institutions, where traditional knowledge systems are still studied.

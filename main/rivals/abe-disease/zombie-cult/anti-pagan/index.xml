      <description>Intro  Social and medical work was/ is used by the missionaries to prepare the ground for conversion. Though Christian propaganda may use the following creed to spread &amp;ldquo;1. Do good to your neighbours. 2. Forgive your enemies. 3. Spread my message all over.&amp;rdquo;, we have noted that Christianity is far more sinister.  Mother Teresa, the angel from hell  Christopher Hitchens says: &amp;ldquo;MT was not a friend of the poor.</description>

      <description>Bede account : TW. Translation of Pope Gregory&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Abbot Melitus (This epistle is dated in the 19th year of the Emperor Maurice): &amp;ldquo;To his most beloved son the Abbot Melitus Gregory the servant of the servants of God We have been much concerned since the departure of our congregation is with you because we have not received any account of the good success of your journey When Almighty God shall bring you to the most man our brother Bishop Augustine tell him upon the most mature deliberation upon the affairs the English I have thought of that is that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to be destroyed but let the idols that are in them be destroyed, let holy water be made and sprinkled in the said temples, let altars be erected and relics placed.</description>

      <description>Unsuccessful fightback  Kalavai Venkat notes: &amp;ldquo;(Dalai Lama was refused a meeting by Pope Francis because it might annoy China [TOI].) Prabhupada did the same. He went to the Vatican, and waited for an audition, only to be told that the pope had canceled the meeting. Sri Sri Ravishankar released audios where he had conversations with Jesus. Thich Nhat Hanh facilitated the shoplifting of the Buddhist meditation techniques and repackaging them as Christian meditation.</description>

      <description>General pattern Saints and martyrs  Many saints were criminals. &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Boniface chopped down Thor&amp;rsquo;s Oak sacred to Germanics, &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Nicholas said to have done same in Lycia to Hellenic sacred trees, &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Martin did same (later Dutch Protestants defaced his cathedral) If you read martyr stories, you find saints going up and destroying shrines and icons, and then threatening to come back with a crusader army if the pagans refuse to convert.</description>

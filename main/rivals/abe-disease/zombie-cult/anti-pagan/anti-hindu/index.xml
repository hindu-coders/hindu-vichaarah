      <description>Priesthood and Protestant background &amp;ldquo;In this article, we propose that both the idea of religious degeneration and the role played by the priests in this process are derived from deep seated Christian conceptions of religion. On the one hand, the biblical story of a god-given religion that was subsequently corrupted through the course of time was the general framework that structured the history of Christianity and of all the other so-called religions.</description>

      <description>Portuguese Catholic assault  Francis Xavier and Portuguese rule.  “The fruit that is reaped by the baptism of infants, as well as by the instruction of children and others, is quite incredible…Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship, I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil [statues of Hindu gods] with a greater amount of insult and abuse…The children run at the idols, upset them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about, and in short heap on them every possible outrage.</description>

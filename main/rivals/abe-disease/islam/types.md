## Political demography of muslims

- WikiIslam statistics [here](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Muslim_Statistics).
- Islamists vs Jihadists
    - Islamists are in favor of establishing a muslim state and curb infiedels "eventually"; but they are not willing to start or participate in a revolution to accomplish it "right now". Jihadists, on the other hand, want to do it \*now\* and are willing to kill/ die for it.
        - Jihadi kid in kAshmIra [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgFPt1FqulE).
    - "Salafis are not jihadists, and most adhere to sects that reject the Islamic State. They are, as Haykel notes, committed to expanding Dar al-Islam, the land of Islam, even, perhaps, with the implementation of monstrous practices such as slavery and amputation—but at some future point. Their first priority is personal purification and religious observance, and they believe anything that thwarts those goals—such as causing war or unrest that would disrupt lives and prayer and scholarship—is forbidden." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Estimates of the percentage of people with radical beliefs in muslim population is at 15-25%, even if the fraction of people who work outside the system to act on them (by terrorizing others) is smaller.

## Sufi-s

###  Sufi jihAd-monging
- [The beauty and beast of sufism](http://www.chakranews.com/beauty-and-the-beast-of-sufism/2454) argues that sufi-ism has not been a great exception. It is a fine expose of the 'beast' (vs the beauty) of sufism - especially its track-record in bhArata.

### Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.
- Philosophy
    - As Carl informs: "In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the 'Uniqueness' of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the 'Oneness' of reality." Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one). Wahdat-ul-Wujood might have permitted monism, polytheism or pantheism - but it has been opposed vehemently by islamic orthodoxy ([Muhammad Salah video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpUw5U5SYjU)). Most ideologues who do openly accept it take great pains to clarify that this does not deviate from the intolerant shariah.
- "It is the orthodox strain of Sufism that got acceptance in the Muslim society, thanks to Imam Ghazzali. The deviant beshariyah Sufis often suffered brutal persecution and even death. " (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
- "The great Sufi saints of India—namely Nizamuddin Auliya, Amir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti and Jalaluddin et al.— held rather orthodox and intolerant views.... they had adopted musical sessions (sama) and dancing (raqs) in their rituals. However, when it came to the real question of Islam, they never took a stand against classical orthodoxy; they always put the Ulema ahead of them in religious matters." (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
- "The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... However, the opposition from the Sufis and Ulema came to bite him eventually when his own son in a plot to seize power had him sentenced to death by the Sharia court and promptly beheaded. After his death his astronomical observatory was demolished along with his heretical art and his intellectual endeavors based on Greek ideas were condemned severely by the Sufi Khwājah Ahrār \[Footnote 2\] as being contrary to the right path."

### Successful undermining of hinduism/ paganism. 

- Sufi-s often act as the "good cop" of Islam, when it comes to selling Islam to pagans. As BE [writes](http://bharatendu.com/2009/07/06/akbar-transition-5/): "The ulemA, the sultAn and the sUfI, now acted as if three columns of the vanguard of Islam, but like the three generals, while they acted in unison at war, internally they wrestled for supremacy over the other"
- However, they did take to violence and vandalism to accomplish their mission at opportune times.
    - "One intriguing thing about Eaton is that his own research of the medieval literatures on Indian Sufis for his Ph.D. thesis, published in Sufis of Bijapur 1300–1700, failed to find any trace of peace in the views and actions of Sufis and in their method of conversion" (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
    - According to al-Maqrīzī, it was sufi Sa'im al-Dahr who destroyed the Sphinx's nose when he found locals making offerings.
- Incorporation of hindu practices, while remaining inimical to hindu-s.
    - Yoga was incorporated into sufiism - eg: Carl Ernst [here](http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/pdf/jras2.pdf), Baḥr al-ḥayāt (Ocean of immortality), an early 17th century Persian Sufi text on yoga [here](http://i.imgur.com/h9TsdOa.jpg).
- Examples:
    - Wali sanga of Java ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_Sanga)).
    - Several sufi mystics in India - especially kAshmIr. Syed Ali bin Shahab-ud-Din Hamadani Abidi (../more on him [here](../../../history/heroes/)).

## Other False hopes

- The [muta'zila movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27tazila), which tried to get to the position that the Quran is man-made and argued for rationality, was vanquished 10 centuries ago, and has not really resurged. Though, there are very small hopeful signs. 
    - Jihad Turk denies that the biographies of muhammad are reliable since they were written 200 years after his death, so he was not such a horrible person \[[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLjMaIR0-k)\]. But, his grounds are shaky elsewhere \[eg: [rebuttal](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-local-imam-misleads-interfaith-groups)\].
- Ahmadiyya-s are about as bad for pagans, despite their rejection by other muslims. Furqan Force ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furqan_Force)) fought India in 1949.

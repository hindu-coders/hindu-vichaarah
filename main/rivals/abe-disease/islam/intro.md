TL;DR : Muslim society is undesirable, despite a supposedly tolerant yet silent majority.

  

## Disclaimers and clarifications

- We are not saying that all muslims are bad people - many are sensible enough not follow the example of their prophet or strictures of Qur'an. Yet, we say that Islam is a vile ideological disease, and should be contained for our own sake.
- Please don't presume to psychoanalyze me and read hatred of muslims. On the contrary, we have no problems empathizing with Muslims at a human level. It is by a good accident of birth that I was not born a muslim. Many of us grew up with muslim friends, and have had many polite (sometimes frank) conversations with muslims.
    - We have received help from and have helped muslims. Further, we understand that Islam is not the only motivator of the good and bad actions of muslims.
- Our judgement of Islam is not restricted to what its liberal or the terrorist extremes do - it includes the entire spectrum (= probability distribution) of behavior observed in Muslims and Muslim societies.

## Undesirability of Muslim society

- Muslim society has a pernicious effect on non-muslim (especially polytheistic) societies. These are detailed in a [separate section](../constituent-subversion/).
- Muslim society is bad for muslims themselves, in the long run. More in the [fitness-effect page](../fitness-effect/).

## Roots of the badness.

### Why is moving beyond bad theology difficult in Islam?

- Islam is historicentric - very much reliant on the deeds and words of a historical person (rather than a deity), Muhammad - whose existence is not questioned by believers.
    - An ideology centered around this ideal muslim ("muhammad ul rasUl allaH"), a historic person, is fundamentally flawed.
    - Mythic elements are rather weak - unlike in Hinduisms, where we have an abundance of talking monkeys, bears and eagles, set in a mythic age. So, it is much harder to challenge the emulation-worthiness of the deeds of Muhammad.
    - The best case:
        - "Muslims can say that slavery is not legitimate now, and that crucifixion is wrong at this historical juncture. Many say precisely this. But they cannot condemn slavery or crucifixion outright without contradicting the Koran and the example of the Prophet. ... That really would be an act of apostasy." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Islam is highly text-centric: There is no part of their holy texts which declare that it is important to move beyond the texts \[check\].
- Later verses have precedence over earlier verses in Quran ([vid](https://youtu.be/vKXGcZlMK_k?t=1132)), in traditional Islam. So, the mostly-Meccan peace-verses are abrogated by the Medina intolerance-verses. Eg: "No compulsion in religion" vs verse of the sword.
- To judge RoP (religion of peace/ Islam) by its holy texts:
    - Muhammad is the ideal muslim. (Anyone blaspheming him is going to be in deep trouble in almost any muslim country.)
    - Muhammad was a horrible human being - a lecherous person, slaver and a mass murderer. (Look at his life stories, starting with the [banu qurayza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza) massacre.)

### Islamic jurisprudence

- Current Islamic jurisprudence \[[Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Madhhab_Map2.png)\] largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes:
    - Prominent sunni schools
        - Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur'an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.
        - Hanafi : The sources from which the Hanafis derive Islamic law are, in order of importance and preference: the [Qur'an](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an), the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet [Muhammad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad) ([hadith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith)), consensus of the Muslim community ([ijma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma)), analogical reasoning ([qiyas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas)), juristic discretion ([istihsan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istihsan)) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ([urf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urf)).
        - Shafi'i: In hierarchical order, the usul al-fiqh consist of: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, ijmā' ("consensus"), and qiyas ("analogy").
        - Maliki:
            -  Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the "living" sunnah than isolated, although sound, hadiths.
        - The Zahiri school of thought recognizes three sources of the Islamic law within the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The first is the Qur'an, considered by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God; the second consists of the prophetic as given in historically verifiable reports, which consist of the sayings and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; the last is absolute consensus of the Muslim community.
    - Prominent shia schools
        - Jaʿfari school: The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school. It differs from the four schools or [madhhabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) of Sunni [jurisprudence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh) in its reliance on [ijtihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijtihad), as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status and the allowing of temporary marriage or[mutʿa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah).
        - Zaidiyyah: In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ’Ali's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ al-Fiqh.
        - Abathi
    - "These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties."
- On the theological support of the jihAdi-s:
    - ISIS [justification](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/isis-commander-justifies-massacre-we-had-called-upon-yazidis-convert): “The Islamic State does its utmost for the repentance of any infidel – whether Yazidi, Crusader, or Jewish. We have been fighting for no other reason than to extract people from their kufr (unbelief) and to usher them into the fold of Islam.” The commander also had a message for Yazidis who have not converted to Islam: “We advise, or even beseech, the Yazidis to come down from the mountains and convert, first and foremost in order to save their souls from the Hellfire, and secondly, if they remain in the mountains, they will die of hunger and thirst.”
    - KE: "Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day."

### False hopes

- The [muta'zila movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27tazila), which tried to get to the position that the Quran is man-made and argued for rationality, was vanquished 10 centuries ago, and has not really resurged. Though, there are very small hopeful signs. 
    - Jihad Turk denies that the biographies of muhammad are reliable since they were written 200 years after his death, so he was not such a horrible person \[[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oLjMaIR0-k)\]. But, his grounds are shaky elsewhere \[eg: [rebuttal](http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/exclusive-local-imam-misleads-interfaith-groups)\].
- Ahmadiyya-s are about as bad for pagans, despite their rejection by other muslims. Furqan Force ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furqan_Force)) fought India in 1949.

#### Sufi-s

- Sufi jihAd-monging
    - [The beauty and beast of sufism](http://www.chakranews.com/beauty-and-the-beast-of-sufism/2454) argues that sufi-ism has not been a great exception. It is a fine expose of the 'beast' (vs the beauty) of sufism - especially its track-record in bhArata.
    - [TW1](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/772644082866909184).
- Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.
    - Philosophy
        - As Carl informs: "In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the 'Uniqueness' of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the 'Oneness' of reality." Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one). Wahdat-ul-Wujood might have permitted monism, polytheism or pantheism - but it has been opposed vehemently by islamic orthodoxy ([Muhammad Salah video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpUw5U5SYjU)). Most ideologues who do openly accept it take great pains to clarify that this does not deviate from the intolerant shariah.
    - "It is the orthodox strain of Sufism that got acceptance in the Muslim society, thanks to Imam Ghazzali. The deviant beshariyah Sufis often suffered brutal persecution and even death. " (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
    - "The great Sufi saints of India—namely Nizamuddin Auliya, Amir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti and Jalaluddin et al.— held rather orthodox and intolerant views.... they had adopted musical sessions (sama) and dancing (raqs) in their rituals. However, when it came to the real question of Islam, they never took a stand against classical orthodoxy; they always put the Ulema ahead of them in religious matters." (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
    - "The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... The Shaikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi silsilā filled with the indignation of Islamic zeal severely condemned these ways of Ulugh Beg. ... However, the opposition from the Sufis and Ulema came to bite him eventually when his own son in a plot to seize power had him sentenced to death by the Sharia court and promptly beheaded. After his death his astronomical observatory was demolished along with his heretical art and his intellectual endeavors based on Greek ideas were condemned severely by the Sufi Khwājah Ahrār \[Footnote 2\] as being contrary to the right path."  
        \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/)\]
- Successful undermining of hinduism/ paganism. 
    - Sufi-s often act as the "good cop" of Islam, when it comes to selling Islam to pagans. As BE [writes](http://bharatendu.com/2009/07/06/akbar-transition-5/): "The ulemA, the sultAn and the sUfI, now acted as if three columns of the vanguard of Islam, but like the three generals, while they acted in unison at war, internally they wrestled for supremacy over the other"
    - However, they did take to violence and vandalism to accomplish their mission at opportune times.
        - "One intriguing thing about Eaton is that his own research of the medieval literatures on Indian Sufis for his Ph.D. thesis, published in Sufis of Bijapur 1300–1700, failed to find any trace of peace in the views and actions of Sufis and in their method of conversion" (kAmakoTi-maNDali [article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1417&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1).)
        - According to al-Maqrīzī, it was sufi Sa'im al-Dahr who destroyed the Sphinx's nose when he found locals making offerings.
    - Incorporation of hindu practices, while remaining inimical to hindu-s.
        - Yoga was incorporated into sufiism - eg: Carl Ernst [here](http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/pdf/jras2.pdf), Baḥr al-ḥayāt (Ocean of immortality), an early 17th century Persian Sufi text on yoga [here](http://i.imgur.com/h9TsdOa.jpg).
    - Examples:
        - Wali sanga of Java ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_Sanga)).
        - Several sufi mystics in India - especially kAshmIr. Syed Ali bin Shahab-ud-Din Hamadani Abidi (../more on him [here](../../../history/heroes/)).

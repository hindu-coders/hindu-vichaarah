      <description>From divodAsa:
 After the fall of Marakkars, the Arakkal Ali Rajas of Kannur followed the same path. Ali Rajas of Arakkal were converts from a line of the Hindu Kolathiri Rajas of north Malabar. There are many folklore associated with them in North Malabar. They gained royal status via association with Kolathiris. But later they betrayed the Hindus of Malabar and began to claim superiority over Hindu kings by allying with Hyder Ali of Mysore [6]</description>

      <description>Context From divodAsa:
 It is to be noted that it was a Muslim who persuaded the Samuthiris to invade Valluvanad and annex the regions, thus turning the national festival of Kerala, Mamankam, into a bloody battlefield where hundreds and hundreds of Nair youths fought and perished. The Muslim leader who persuaded Samuthiris were given the title Calicut Koya and was appointed as bodyguard of Samuthiri, always taking position to his right side [2].</description>

      <description>Repeated moplah outrages in keraLa 1849-1923. Tw, TwImg, GB.  From divodAsa:
 The atrocities of Hyder and Tipu on Malabar Hindus is well recorded and it need not be discussed in detail here as it is beyond the scope of the article. Later, as history records, Tipu was defeated during his invasion of Travancore and was forced to retreat back to Mysore, where he eventually met his end.</description>

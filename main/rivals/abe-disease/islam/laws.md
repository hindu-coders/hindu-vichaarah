## On the theological support of the jihAdi-s
- Killing unbelievers: Qur'an 2:191, 4:89, 9:5, 9:29. Beheading: 47:4, 8:12. Violence against non-Muslims: 8:39, 48:29, 9:73. Terror: 3:151, 8:60. Sex slavery of infidel women ("captives of the right hand") 4:3, 4:34, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30. 
- ISIS [justification](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/isis-commander-justifies-massacre-we-had-called-upon-yazidis-convert): “The Islamic State does its utmost for the repentance of any infidel – whether Yazidi, Crusader, or Jewish. We have been fighting for no other reason than to extract people from their kufr (unbelief) and to usher them into the fold of Islam.” The commander also had a message for Yazidis who have not converted to Islam: “We advise, or even beseech, the Yazidis to come down from the mountains and convert, first and foremost in order to save their souls from the Hellfire, and secondly, if they remain in the mountains, they will die of hunger and thirst.”
- KE: "Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day."

## Sharia enforcement
- Ridiculous fatwas (judicial opinions of mullah-s/ ulema-s) continue to be issued \[See[Arun Shourie's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iVIec5e3_0&feature)\] around the muslim world. Yes, this "high literature" does influence the lives and attitudes of muslims.
    - Examples: Opinions on [beating women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty-q9GTure4), sex slaves (Details in a separate section).
- Sharia policing within (even minority) muslim communities and neighborhoods.
    - Societies such as [Tablighi Jamat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat) (India) enforce retrograde mores among the muslim ummah.

## Islamic jurisprudence

- Current Islamic jurisprudence \[[Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Madhhab_Map2.png)\] largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes:

### Prominent sunni schools

- Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur'an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.
- Hanafi : The sources from which the Hanafis derive Islamic law are, in order of importance and preference: the [Qur'an](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an), the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet [Muhammad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad) ([hadith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith)), consensus of the Muslim community ([ijma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma)), analogical reasoning ([qiyas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyas)), juristic discretion ([istihsan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istihsan)) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ([urf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urf)).
- Shafi'i: In hierarchical order, the usul al-fiqh consist of: the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, ijmā' ("consensus"), and qiyas ("analogy").
- Maliki:
    -  Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the "living" sunnah than isolated, although sound, hadiths.
- The Zahiri school of thought recognizes three sources of the Islamic law within the principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The first is the Qur'an, considered by Muslims to be the verbatim word of God; the second consists of the prophetic as given in historically verifiable reports, which consist of the sayings and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad; the last is absolute consensus of the Muslim community.

### Prominent shia schools

- Jaʿfari school: The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school. It differs from the four schools or [madhhabs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) of Sunni [jurisprudence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh) in its reliance on [ijtihad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijtihad), as well as on matters of inheritance, religious taxes, commerce, personal status and the allowing of temporary marriage or[mutʿa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%E2%80%98ah).
        - Zaidiyyah: In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ’Ali's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ al-Fiqh.
        - Abathi
    - "These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties."

## Why is moving beyond bad theology difficult in Islam?

- Islam is historicentric - very much reliant on the deeds and words of a historical person (rather than a deity), Muhammad - whose existence is not questioned by believers.
    - An ideology centered around this ideal muslim ("muhammad ul rasUl allaH"), a historic person, is fundamentally flawed.
    - Mythic elements are rather weak - unlike in Hinduisms, where we have an abundance of talking monkeys, bears and eagles, set in a mythic age. So, it is much harder to challenge the emulation-worthiness of the deeds of Muhammad.
    - The best case:
        - "Muslims can say that slavery is not legitimate now, and that crucifixion is wrong at this historical juncture. Many say precisely this. But they cannot condemn slavery or crucifixion outright without contradicting the Koran and the example of the Prophet. ... That really would be an act of apostasy." \[[ISIS_A](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/)\]
- Islam is highly text-centric: There is no part of their holy texts which declare that it is important to move beyond the texts \[check\].
- Later verses have precedence over earlier verses in Quran ([vid](https://youtu.be/vKXGcZlMK_k?t=1132)), in traditional Islam. So, the mostly-Meccan peace-verses are abrogated by the Medina intolerance-verses. Eg: "No compulsion in religion" vs verse of the sword.
- To judge RoP (religion of peace/ Islam) by its holy texts:
    - Muhammad is the ideal muslim. (Anyone blaspheming him is going to be in deep trouble in almost any muslim country.)
    - Muhammad was a horrible human being - a lecherous person, slaver and a mass murderer. (Look at his life stories, starting with the [banu qurayza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Qurayza) massacre.)

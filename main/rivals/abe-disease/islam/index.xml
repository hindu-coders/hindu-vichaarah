      <description>Arab superiority Although the Prophet said all were equal before Allah, founders of 3/4 sunni madhabs explicitly mentioned superiority of Arabs. Even Zaydi Shias give them the same special privileges.
-Sayyids (plural Sadah) (descendants of the Prophet) -Quraysh (the tribe the prophet was from) -other Arabs -non Arabs
Only Maliki school doesn&amp;rsquo;t preach Arab superiority.
Marriage restrictions &amp;ldquo;Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school said that mawla (non Arabs) men are unsuitable to marry Arab women.</description>

      <description>Raid booty to market hogging Via MT.
 Yuanshi records an interesting conversation between kulashekhara Pandya-I &amp;amp; the ambassador of Kubilai Khan. The pANDya states: &amp;ldquo;All Muslim states make full use of their countries’ natural products- gold, pearls and precious objects [and with] all their surpluses the Muslims come [here] to trade&amp;rdquo; This suggests that by 1280 CE the Mohd were using their wealth to get a grip on South Indian markets.</description>

      <description>Long term malaise A muslim society is, in the long term, bad for the muslim population itself, due to:
 Misogyny taking many forms:  Forced veil for women, Taharroush rape game, female genital mutiliation.   Opposition to free spirited scientific enquiry in general. Islam is bloody within and without. So, muslims tend to fight each other to death about what &amp;ldquo;true islam&amp;rdquo; is and who is a &amp;ldquo;heretic&amp;rdquo;. Opposition to joy of many types, and increase in &amp;ldquo;victimless crimes&amp;rdquo; at worst, or a schizophrenic acceptance at best extending to even allowance of child abuse (eg.</description>

      <description>Good muslim con  avidyA (ignorance): &amp;ldquo;Good acts of some muslims towards kufrs prove the benignness of Islam.&amp;rdquo; vidyA (knowledge): &amp;ldquo;Considering both good and bad acts of muslims, Islam is a virulent memetic disease of epidemic proportions with an overwhelmingly net negative effect on the host kufr population.&amp;rdquo; See sphulinga/u3mob stream See sphulinga/u3support stream  Details follow.
Outlier nature  &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo; acts of muslims towards kufr, even when taken at face value (ie not taqiyyah), are notable precisely because they are extraordinary.</description>

      <description>Islamic iconoclasm is well known. Some salient examples are given below. Other examples of anti-iconography sentiment: snowman fatwa, maldives museum attack.  Saudi Arabia and the middle east:  muhammad and the idols at kAbA. The tree planted by ZarathruShTa. ISIL kalIf  Yazidi temples. Museum vandalism and library burning - DM201502. Nimrud. Palmyra.    Egypt, Lybia  &amp;ldquo;Al-Malik al-Aziz Uthman the son of the counter-crusader Salah ad-Din who wanted clean Giza of its jāhilīyah devoted a large amount of labor to demolish the pyramids but only having succeeded in damaging the smallest of the big three eventually gave up.</description>

      <description>Sanskrit vs Farsi  The entry of Persian into India was mostly due to it being the court / official language of a great Muslim kings. It was &amp;ldquo;high culture&amp;rdquo; for them (even if they were ethnic turks). This is how India got the camp language (urdu) with its heavy use of farsi and arabic loan words. Common soldiers in the camps had to converse with the farsi spouting nobility. To quote Sandeep: &amp;ldquo;Kannada was the official language of the Mysore state when the Wodeyar dynasty ruled over the Mysore kingdom…When Tipu took over, he changed the administrative language from Kannada to Farsi.</description>

 For 89-year-old Challa Chandra Reddy, the memories of August 27, 1948, are vivid. “August 27 is observed as a dark day in Bairanpalli. It was on this day in 1948 that 92 residents of Bairanpalli were slaughtered mercilessly. Women were raped and terrorised. Razakaars went up to the extent of making women play bathukamma naked,” he claimed. (In Navaratri, Batukamma festival is celebrated by Telugus.</description>

      <description>Summary Arab or Islamic or Christian science are but continuations of prior pagan traditions.
 &amp;ldquo;Arab&amp;rdquo; science wasn&amp;rsquo;t Arab, but Persian (Avicenna, Biruni, AlKhawarizmi (Algorithm), etc.), Syriac, Chaldean, from long traditions that preceded the Arab invasion. They just wrote in Arabic; Newton wrote in Latin but isn&amp;rsquo;t called &amp;ldquo;Italian&amp;rdquo;. - NN Taleb
 Neo-platonic influence and rejection  &amp;ldquo;So in reality the so called “Islamic Science” was a venture of the pagan Neo-Platonists fleeing the terror of Isaism, and many of the early “Islamic intellectuals” like Thabit ibn Kurra were by their own admission Hellenistic pagans.</description>

      <description>Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.   As Carl informs: &amp;ldquo;In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Uniqueness&amp;rsquo; of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Oneness&amp;rsquo; of reality.&amp;rdquo; Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one).</description>

      <description>Broad goals RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness. We may look at how other nations are dealing with the problem. As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained.</description>

      <description>Legal divisions   Maddhab Map2    Current Islamic jurisprudence largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes.  Prominent sunni schools  Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur&amp;rsquo;an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.</description>

      <description>Motivating Concepts  Motivating Terrorism  KE: &amp;ldquo;Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day.</description>

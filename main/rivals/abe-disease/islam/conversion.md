## How Islam attracts converts

- Examples of converts are noted [here](../../../../hinduism/benefits/).
- Philosophical simplicity
    - 1 jealous god who stands apart, 1 devil, 1 final prophet, simple afterlife and origin stories, almost no image veneration
- Simple practice
    - 5 things to do, 5 prayers, 1 fast
    - Rigid structure for those who seek it.
- Communal benefits and threats
    - A brotherhood among the ummah
    - By threats and love marriages.
- Anti hindu rhetoric
    - Attack "weak" points
        - "superstition and idol centric ritualism"
            - "Tamil Nadu Towheed Jamaat conducts anti - superstition conferences along with shirk ozhippu"
        - jAti hierarchy

## Forced conversions.

- The choice for polytheists in the mercy of muslim rulers was often: Convert or die, with an occasional option of "pay the discriminatory jizya tax".
- Other curtailment of religious freedom: Apostacy
    - [Report](http://ex-muslim.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Apostasy_Report_Web1.pdf).
    - Popular support for death to apostates in Egypt and Pakistan (2014) - [WP](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/01/64-percent-of-muslims-in-egypt-and-pakistan-support-the-death-penalty-for-leaving-islam/).

## Consequences

### Racinomiscia = Hatred of one's cultural roots

- Islam is a sort of Arab-pride, militant anti-pagan movement.
- An example from a Bangladeshi author is [here](http://nabeelafsar.com/2014/05/27/islam-as-an-arab-pride-movement/). "In exploring my Bengali heritage, I felt short-changed by my Muslim upbringing. If I was to trust my family, it was as if my ancestors were feral dogs who had been civilized by the wonderful Arabs who brought them the miracle of Islam."  "Why was my family trying so desperately to reach the standard of Arabian Islam when their own cultural heritage was so much more powerful, so much more relevant to modern life, and so much older?" "The answer is that Islam condemns paganism and polytheism without fully understanding what those spiritual traditions actually are. And the people conquered by the Arabs, forced to adopt their new religion, inevitably adopted their prejudices too."
- As the great author of mAnasataraMgiNI says (I paraphrase): "Islam brings hatred-of-ones'-roots to its non-Arab votaries; Even when they lose the madness to secularize, the hatred-of-ones'-roots continues; for example secular citizens of the terrorist state of Pakistan".
- Ambedkar famously [pointed](http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm) out:
    - As the invasions were accompanied with. destruction of temples and forced conversions, with spoliation of property, with slaughter, enslavement and abasement of men, women and children, what wonder if the memory of these invasions has ever remained green, as a source of pride to the Muslims and as a source of shame to the Hindus ?
    - The only way to make Hindustan homogeneous is to arrange for exchange of population. Until that is done, it must be admitted that even with the creation of Pakistan, the problem of majority vs. minority will remain in Hindustan as before and will continue to produce disharmony in the body politic of Hindustan.

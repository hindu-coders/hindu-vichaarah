- Egalitarianism, anti-elitism, opposition to heredity influence (even in descriptive scientific research on phenotypes important in social functions).
- In the old hard strain - Dictatorship of the proletariat. Examples: Soviet state. Khmer Rouge. Naxals.
- In newer strains - Mixutre with econolatory (see [main page](../) for intro). 
  - Examples: SJW-s of Soros who participated in 2020 US Race riots and more. Venus project. Urban naxals of India.

## History
- "the old strain was very much dependent on the Soviet continuation of the old Rus empire. Once that fell, it was like a chariot that had lost a wheel."
- "While it briefly infected the Cīna-s, what people do not get is that it was domesticated to the ultimate advantage of the Cīna-s as it encountered an even more potent endogenous coopter in the form Wei Yang Lord Shang’s legalism. Thus, the old strain was mostly a failure."
- "However, a lineage of it survived in mleccha academia where it was incubated in the Ivy League soft departments and their more pedestrian arborizations as a local disease, much like a virus jumping from animal to animal in a Cīna “wet-market”."
- "Like SARS-1 it has had localized outbreaks and was mostly used a weapon by mleccha-s against others like the Hindus — e.g. to reinvigorate the Naxals in the form of their urban variant (“the urban Naxals” as a Bollywood producer terms it). "
- "Its local outbreaks were mostly seen in the mleccha academia and news media. A few years ago we heard of a left-leaning professor couple being forced out of a mleccha liberal arts college by a particularly sustained outbreak of this disease. Some other, otherwise rather neutral and harmless, mleccha physicians/professors were also seriously targeted but being part of the Ivy elite themselves they suffered little from the attacks. Similarly, there was a mlecchikā who used to originally think of the rākṣasonmāda as a great blessing on humanity. "
- "Thus, those who were observant and discerning knew that this extremely dangerous mānasika-ruj was just waiting to jump out into the wider population like a viral pandemic."

## Anti Hindu activity
- Naxalism

### Urban Naxalism
- "A part of the urban Bhārata elite are nothing other than mleccha-s with an asita-tvak; hence, they would get similarly afflicted by the disease. Like all the prior abrahma-ruj-s, this latest strain retains its inherent hate for dharma and theoclasm. Hence, the Hindu elite will need to become aware of this dangerous disease and not be fooled by the subterfuge it practices of hiding beneath other causes of jana-kopa. One thing that will show its face to Hindus will be its collaboration with marūnmāda and its śanti-dūta-s and pretonmāda and its prema-dūta-s in Bhārata."
- 2020 eruptions - "Already it was used by the duṣṭa Sora against Bhārata in conjunction with the marūnmatta-s in the recent past."

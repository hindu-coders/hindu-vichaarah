      <description>Manifestations Temple control  In several states (eg. draviDianists in tamiL nADu), government controls temple administration, and forces dilution and destruction of tradition. One can reduce their efforts to: &amp;ldquo;What stops a secular Government from appointing a non-Hindu woman who will enter the garbha griha during her monthly periods and offer beef biryani as prasad?&amp;rdquo; (Suren)  Protestant background &amp;ldquo;If there were differences between Orientalists and Anglicists in this regard, they were very shallow.</description>

      <description>Relation to local systems  &amp;ldquo;the world has come a long way from the sārthavāha-s of yore who even when wide-ranging did not disrupt the local systems. For instance, in say the Marahaṭṭā country, where we formerly lived, there was the system of the bārā balutedāra-s which has perhaps lasted in some form from the pre-Āryan days of the Harappan civilization. This system comprised of 12 jāti-s who offered essential services for a village.</description>

      <description>Intro  Secularist argument: &amp;ldquo;If your religious faith requires you to enforce its tenets on those who are not members of your faith-community, then your religion is incompatible with a free society and society has a right to defend itself against such encroachment.&amp;rdquo; Secularism, being in some sense &amp;ldquo;softer&amp;rdquo; in appearance to harder anti-theism and Abrahamisms, is insidious and dangerous from the heathen perspective. Hence it merits a separate page. Alternative phrases that helps us understand secularism better  sickularism (via Ambreesh) - post-christian christianism.</description>

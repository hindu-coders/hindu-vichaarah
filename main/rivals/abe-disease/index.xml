      <description>Intro  Military response - see defence page.  MT posits: &amp;ldquo;Mohammedanism needed special backing for its effective survival in the subcontinent. &amp;hellip; Demographic and missionary aggression by Mohammedanism might not have been sufficient for it to overrun the Hindu dharma.&amp;rdquo;   For generic intellectual and identity based response patterns, see defence/id page &amp;ldquo;The striving for non-Hinduness might have even lead to internal rifts within Mohammedanism as each group was trying be more Mohammedan than the other.</description>

      <description>Intro With rare exceptions, all abrahamisms agree on some basic concepts. Abrahamisms have certain indispensable beliefs (dogmas), without which the thought-system would collapse. (Aksharananda here.) Particular exceptions case of 0-theism is considered separately.

True vs False Gods  true God and false gods (supposedly unwitting followers of Satan), universal urge for religion/ divinity, religion (= worshiping the true God, rejecting false gods) References  BG here, here.</description>

      <description>Zero sum game  &amp;ldquo;National anthem, Cashmereyaut, suppression of dummy grad students etc are mere facades for the really elephant in the room that H themselves are afraid to see &amp;ndash; there can be no coexistence between Abe and the heathens &amp;amp; Abe will do all it takes to make us fertilizer for the soil.&amp;rdquo; [TW16]  Why natural polytheisms? Why the big deal? Objections  &amp;ldquo;Let everyone get along by just belonging to the same religion - all roads lead to God.</description>

So there is the concept of &amp;ldquo;right worship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;false worship&amp;rdquo;.  By contrast, pUjA can take many forms. Consider: आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्। सर्वदेवनमस्काराः केशवं प्रति गच्छति॥   The famous Abrahamist objection to goes: &amp;ldquo;Worship the creator, not the creation.</description>

 In the first stage, a Westerner approaches an Indian guru or tradition with extreme deference, and acquires the knowledge as a sincere disciple. Once the transfer of knowledge complete, the former disciple, or/and his/her followers progressively erase all traces of the original source, repackages the ideas as their own thought, and may even proceed to denigrate the source tradition. In the final stage, the ideas are exported back to India by the former disciple and/or his followers for consumption.</description>

Example: &amp;ldquo;Dravidian&amp;rdquo; faultine and the Anglospheric interventions.  Language  (Regional) Language chauvinism is a front for secularism. Allows the other to claim to be part of the culture they seek to destroy.</description>

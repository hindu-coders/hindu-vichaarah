## Better orders
- Exceptional orders, which need to be promoted at the expense of khAlistAni akAli subversive traitors.
- arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev's shabads form the bulk of granth sahib.
- udAsi-s who controlled gurudvAra-s before AkAli takeover in 1920-s.
- sanAtan shastar vidyA \[[SV16](http://www.shastarvidiya.org/articles/misunderstandings.html)\]

## Limited defence
- Shikhs are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism. This exaggerates their relatively minor role relative to, say, the marATha-s; and underplays the real strong hindu influences on the later Sikh elite (like ranjit singh).
- With the emergence of modern Hindutva, the "democratization" of kShatra by sikhs is superseded (and rendered obsolete) by a better version more consonant with overall tradition.

### Govinda-siMha
> "Among other things, Govind assures Aurangzeb that he is just as much an idol-breaker as the Padeshah himself: “I am the destroyer of turbulent hillmen, since they are idolators and I am the breaker of idols.” Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the correspondence (possibly several letters) he received from the Guru, for he ordered Wazir Khan not to trouble Govind any longer. ... So far, it is hard to see where the Sikhs have acted as the sword-arm of Hinduism against Islam. If secularism means staying on reasonable terms with both Hindus and Muslims, we could concede that the Gurus generally did steer a “secular” course. Not that this is shameful: in the circumstances, taking on the Moghul Empire would have been suicidal." \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2011/12/guru-tegh-bahadurs-martyrdom.html)11\]

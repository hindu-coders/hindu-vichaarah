      <description>Disdain for &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo; hindu  Sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms. See anti-hindu patterns page for details.  mIri-pIri  It aimed to rearm hindus (spiritually and materially) during oppressive Mughal muslim times by emphasizing (even by &amp;ldquo;democratizing&amp;rdquo;) kShatra. In a sense, they revived the Steppe warrior ethos - albeit in a limited sense (lacking in sophistication, and with many unArya tendencies).</description>

      <description> General understanding of sikh drives and patterns are explained elsewhere. With the emergence of modern Hindutva, the &amp;ldquo;democratization&amp;rdquo; of kShatra by sikhs is superseded (and rendered obsolete) by a better version more consonant with overall Hindu tradition. Within sikhs, the better traditions (see pro-hindu patterns page) merit encouragement.  </description>

      <description>Better orders  Exceptional orders, which need to be promoted at the expense of khAlistAni akAli subversive traitors. arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev&amp;rsquo;s shabads form the bulk of granth sahib. udAsi-s who controlled gurudvAra-s before AkAli takeover in 1920-s. sanAtan shastar vidyA [SV16]  Limited defence  Shikhs are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism. This exaggerates their relatively minor role relative to, say, the marATha-s; and underplays the real strong hindu influences on the later Sikh elite (like ranjit singh).</description>

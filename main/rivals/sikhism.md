## Intro
sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms.  

- The holy texts: \[list [here](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/darsanam/an-yadarsanani)\]
    - Gurdas Vaar (not part of the grantha) supposedly relates the mecca visit tale too.
    - hard core khAlistanis who don't even accept dahsam granth.

### Anti-hindu patterns
Some disturbing patterns include:

- Equating hinduism with inimical abrahamisms
- image worship (and many other hindu activities) are considered "superstition" - the video fits right in. (This should remind you of the anti-superstition = anti-hindu legislation of our sickular overlords). This often degenerates to active iconoclasm or tolerance of iconoclasm - (W1, [W2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry_in_Sikhism#Smiting_of_the_nose_of_Durga.27s_idol)) and mocking of hindu rituals (upanayana, tarpaNa by guru NAnak, durgA pUjA by some later guru according to some accounts).
- Some problem shabads in the granth sahib come from Kabir.
- Subversion to fit the british
    - Kahn Singh Nabha + macauliffe.

### Exceptional orders
- Exceptional orders, which need to be promoted at the expense of khAlistAni akAli subversive traitors.
  - arjun-deva, 5th in line after nAnaka, was pro-veda and pro-smRti. Arjan dev's shabads form the bulk of granth sahib**.**
  - udAsi-s who controlled gurudvAra-s before AkAli takeover in 1920-s.
  - sanAtan shastar vidyA \[[SV16](http://www.shastarvidiya.org/articles/misunderstandings.html)\]

## Virtual kin marker temorarily increasing group fitness
- "In this context one could also bring up the case of the pA~nchanada-uShnIShamoha. This moha emerged as result of part but not whole of the khilimoha infecting the Hindu population of the pa~nchanada. The result was the emergence of a new recombinant memetic virus, the uShnIShamoha that retained the self-propagating tendencies of the original khilimoha. This infection was very mild in terms of fitness reduction, but provided a strong virtual kin marker that allowed the infected group to prevail and spread at the expense of the Hindus of the pa~nchanada, and also offered protection to the infected against being overrun by the spreading khilimoha. But as its numbers increased its utility as such a virtual kin marker diminished. Nevertheless, it continues to serve this purpose to a degree in new areas colonized by its carriers, such as North America." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/khilonmada-charcha/)\]

## Limited defence of hinduism
- Shikhs are falsely protrayed as a sword arm of hinduism. This exaggerates their relatively minor role relative to, say, the marATha-s; and underplays the real strong hindu influences on the later Sikh elite (like ranjit singh).
- "Among other things, Govind assures Aurangzeb that he is just as much an idol-breaker as the Padeshah himself: “I am the destroyer of turbulent hillmen, since they are idolators and I am the breaker of idols.” Aurangzeb was sufficiently pleased with the correspondence (possibly several letters) he received from the Guru, for he ordered Wazir Khan not to trouble Govind any longer. ... So far, it is hard to see where the Sikhs have acted as the sword-arm of Hinduism against Islam. If secularism means staying on reasonable terms with both Hindus and Muslims, we could concede that the Gurus generally did steer a “secular” course. Not that this is shameful: in the circumstances, taking on the Moghul Empire would have been suicidal." \[[KE](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2011/12/guru-tegh-bahadurs-martyrdom.html)11\]

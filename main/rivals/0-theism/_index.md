## As a maturation of Abrahamism
- They go: "There’s only one God, and He doesn’t exist."

### Philosophy
- "New atheism, Marxism, secularism etc are palpably mutations of Abrahamism where the theic reduction reaches the natural conclusion in 0 from 1. However, it retains the same counter-heathen definition inherited without change from Abrahamism." {[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1064698752517226496)}
- "But that idealism and intellectualism are inseparable is made much clearer in Lewis Feuer's great work "Ideology and the Ideologists”. In "Ideology and the Ideologists", Feuer connects the Mosaic revolutionary myth with Marxism, bridging Abrahamism with secular ideology. "The prototype for the ideologies of intellectuals is the Mosaic \[distinction\].  Maoist, Naxalite, separatist, Marxist ideologies, and so on, which are creations of intellectuals, follow an Abrahamically-rooted scheme." –Lewis Feuer A people are oppressed, a savior (messiah) or saviors (proletariat) come, there is revolution, liberation, and then “true history" starts. In other words the liberation meme that's so characteristic of deterministic philosophy and secular ideology actually has religious origins." [OGS16](https://twitter.com/OGSaffron/status/796270938195165185)

### History
- Vicious internal conflicts (eg. protestants vs catholics) amongst or with the Abrahamisms led to the rise of secularism.
- "However, the “pratyakSha” of science kept repeatedly hammering on the “pramANa” of the pretapustaka, with the final blow coming much closer to our times with the publication of the evolutionary theory by Darwin. One would have thought that this blow the pretamata would have no leg to stand on. However, even that did not eradicate the pretamata. Rather, the two apparently contradictory trajectories continued to coexist in the mlechCha world with the strengthening a concept called the separation of the secular from the sacral. This offered an opportunity for the pretamata to not just survive but even expand by pushing both its rapine secularized version that continued to engulf heathen civilizations in the name of various secular constructs and its unadulterated evangelistic form. This aspect is indeed seen by the imposition of the same kind dialog on heathen civilizations like our own wherein we are forced to cut up knowledge by separating secular from sacral \[One might look up this earlier note in this regard\]. This is followed by a trivialization of our sacral structures making it easy for the pretamata \[or for that matter the rAkShasa-mata\] to fill up the ensuing vacuum."  \[[MT](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmanasataramgini.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2F10%2Fthe-end-of-the-heathens%2F&h=iAQF6fwII&s=1)\]

- "To the surprise of many H, western liberals while opposed to u2 are even greater enemies of heathenism (e.g. the CEO of this platform and his agents). This is also seen with u3 e.g. Pakistanis or B'deshis who shed their religion typically do not become H. They become secular/atheist  and typically retain their old anti-H tendencies intact - thus they are often darlings of those who seek racial but not doctrinal variety." {[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1064698752517226496)}

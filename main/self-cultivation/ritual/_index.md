## Ritual reality and ritual coherence
- "This is how our ritual spaces work and something I hope can be drilled into the heads of the judges who have no erudition about our religion. The deity’s nature (in Southern Agamika & tAntrika temples, this is based on the mantra-s installed in the deity’s icon/vigraha), location of deity’s shrine, nature of rituals done, type of priesthood, kind of food and flower offerings made to deity, nature of people who come to the temple, colors of garments worn by the deity, priests & devotees & many other factors all have to cohere with one another as far as possible. All these factors come together to create a coherent “ritual reality”, which is the ultimate fruit a sincere worshiper truly yearns for. The deity’s presence becomes fully manifest and becomes a source of blessings for the worshipers and their families. Different Agama-s and tantra-s have their own versions of the “ritual reality” or “ritual universe” they are asking the priests and others to enact on this earth." {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}

- "Some idiot Hindus stated that the argument that shrI dharmashAstA in his form as ayyappa is observing naiSThika brahmacharya is not a sensible one as it suggests that ayyappa is “unable to see his women devotees in the 10-50 age group as sisters or mothers”. ... Our deities have transcendental and most subtle bodies. They do not “eat offerings” or “observe brahmacaryam” in the same way mortals would be seen in our mundane level of reality. Rituals and myths operate at a higher level of reality. What is the significance of this? ... All these factors come together to create a coherent “ritual reality”, which is the ultimate fruit a sincere worshiper truly yearns for. The deity’s presence becomes fully manifest and becomes a source of blessings for the worshipers and their families."  {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}


### Domain of the sacred and taboos

Even though, fundamentally, there is no sacred vs profane distinction in the hindu POV in terms of restriction of applicability of concepts such as "dharma" and "brahman", there is such distinction in the world of practice (a book should not be stepped on, though one can step on a shoe). Hindus are naturally emotionally affected by attacks or regard to these sacred entities. They serve to preserve some biases useful in the pursuit of dharma, artha and kaama.

- "While H dharma has much diversity of praxis within it of course there are red lines. Fundamentally a religion does define the existence of a domain which might be termed sacred; which in the H system is related to praxis; so interference or infringement of those domains are red lines." \[[MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/703393262485282816)\]
- vAma-tantra-s involve deliberate transgression of these sacred limits in the hopes of liberation. \[ST in Sutra\]

#### Participation by abstinence
- "When you participate in a religion, you do so, not only by doing what you are obligated to do, or doing something optional but allowed for you, but also by not doing what is prohibited. ..." {[GA18](https://aryanthought.wordpress.com/2018/07/22/a-short-discussion-on-pertinent-issues-presented-by-the-sabarimala-matter/)}

## Structure vs feeling tension

- The veda-s emphasize both proper and meticulous performance; and feeling (There is the story {[TS 2.6.10](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_042_Krishna_Yajurvediya_Taittiriya_Samhita_Part_5_-_Kasinath_Sastri_Agase_1946#page/n93/mode/1up)} of shaMyu who to whom fruits of yajJNA are to be diverted, if it is performed without devotional feeling or without respect for prescribed structure).
- "Of course, if we say "just pray from heart", it becomes too open and possibly chaotic. Rules are there to enforce discipline and provide some structure. But, if there are too many rules, the same thing that is intended to provide structure to the ritual can become constricting and suffocating. The suffocation may eliminate all feeling from the ritual. Based on one's desa-kala-patra, one has to find the right balance between rules (Pingala, solar channel) and emotion (Ida, lunar channel). One should follow some rules that provide a structure without suffocating one and allow one to add emotion to the ritual. Then one can make a connection." [NR_FB15](https://www.facebook.com/pvr108/posts/10153156010758284).


### Examples of "feeling" trumping:
#### In the veda-s 
\[[TW17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/853343223342878721)\].

- "kavaSa ailUSa who was expelled by the RSis from a sattra on account of his maternal heritage (she was a dAsa woman; I suspect druhyu heritage). Expelled to the desert & suffering from thirst he sees the aponaptrīya sūkta and in the desert, the waters of the sarasvatI run to him."
- "The innocent, naive devotee whose silly actions still please the deity: kaNNappa nAyanmAr's spitting water on rudra as ablution to a creative mind, can be said to be prefigured in the story of apālā who chews the soma plant with her teeth to press out the juice for Indra."
- "The trope of the devotee who risks everything for his cherished deva: could be said to be prefigured in the story of Rjrashva who, seeing a she-wolf (and recognizing it as the divine animal it was; I.e. Sent by the ashvinau), offered a hundred sheep to satiate it and was blinded by his father as a consequence! However, the ashvinau, pleased with him, gave back his eyes."

#### In the itihAsa-s and purANa-s
- shabari giving rAma berries she tasted for sweetness.
- Hunter kaNNappa spitting water on rudra as ablution.

  
## Language

Ritual (mantra-s and hymns therein) can involve specialized language. The use and preservation of sanskrit for ritual purposes was an important ancestral IE trait - seen in Lithuanians, Romans and Indo-Aryans (ref. patanjalI).

Yet, local languages were harmoniously integrated in later ritual systems which involved non IE devotees. Though, some opposers of Agama and veda-s have tried to use this as a dividing point ([Chidambaram08 HK](https://haindavakeralam.com/atheist-assault-shiva-temple-hk14653)).

## Initiation

A western pagan reconstructionist's view ([KR16](https://krasskova.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/thoughts-on-initiation/)) with divination for compatibility testing etc.. is consonant with many hindu mantra traditions.

### Eligibility limitations

- The [right to exclusivity](../communal-support/exclusivity/) (based on gender, stage of life, varNa, position etc..) naturall applies.

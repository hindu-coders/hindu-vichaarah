  <p><strong>Appendix</strong></p>
<p>Using the Babari Masjid-Ramajanmabhumi controversy as a pretext, Muslim
mobs went on a rampage all over Bangladesh. They attacked and burnt down
Hindu houses and business establishments in many places, murdered some
Hindus and inflicted injuries on many others. Hindu temples and
monasteries invited their special attention everywhere.</p>
<p>Starting on October 29, 1989, the mob fury reached its climax on
November 9 and 10 after the Shilanyas ceremony at Ayodhya. Many temples
were demolished or burnt down or damaged in various ways. Images of
deities were broken and thrown out. Temple priests were beaten up.</p>
<p>The Government of Bangladesh kept on looking the other way for almost
two weeks. Then it called off the operation. It also ordered repairs to
a dozen temples in order to maintain the pretence that what had been
done was not a command performance.</p>
<p>We reproduce below a report received by us.</p>

      <description>CHAPTER I
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON INDIAN HISTORY
Mathew Arnold had composed his famous lines with reference to a particular context. He had the Buddha and similar Hindu sages in mind when he wrote the following famous lines:
 The East bowed low before the blast,
In patient deep disdain;
She let the legions thunder past,
And plunged in thought again.
 Little did the poet suspect that his tribute to Hindu spirituality would be twisted to embellish an imperialist version of Indian history according to which the “meek Hindu” had always been preoccupied with sterile speculations, and seldom stood up in defence of his country and culture.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
ARAB FAILURE IN SINDH, KABUL AND ZABUL
In Chapter I of his book, Dr. Misra gives dates as well as details regarding the rapid conquests made by the armies of Islam after the death of its prophet in AD 632. The Byzantine provinces of Palestine and Syria fell to them after a six month’s campaign in AD 636-637. Next came the turn of the Sassanid empire of Persia which included Iraq, Iran, and Khorasan.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
FRUSTRATION OF THE GHAZNAVIDS
The standard text-books of Indian history taught in our schools and colleges do not highlight at all the stupendous failure of the Islamised Arabs in the face of heroic Hindu resistance. What they highlight instead is the series of successful raids made by Mahmud Ghaznavi into the heartland of India, and the subsequent crumbling of Hindu kingdoms in North India before the determined onslaughts of Muhammad Ghuri.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
PERFIDY WINS WHERE VALOUR FAILED
The theologians of Islam had laid down, in the opening years of this imperialist ideology, that the kãfirs who could not be subdued by force should be subverted by fraud. The prophet of Islam had himself initiated the first lessons in this lore when he practised what came to be known as Siyãsat-i-Madînah in later times, that is, to take the kãfirs one by one and that too when they are least expecting an attack.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
THE LESSONS WE HAVE TO LEARN
Dr. Misra’s monograph is pertinent not only to a past period of Indian history but also to our situation at present. The lessons which this learned study draws for us can be ignored by us only at our own peril.
Firstly, it highlights Hindu heroism in the face of an inveterate Islamic imperialism. Such heroism has seldom been seen in the annals of any other people.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
THE NATURE OF NATIONAL FRONTIERS
At times and in certain situations, the frontiers of a nation are not merely physical; they are also ideological. We shall never be able to overcome our predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan unless we understand her ideological frontiers and define our own.
Compared to us Pakistan is much smaller in size and population. She is much poorer in industrial infrastructure and other resources. Yet she has attacked us not once but three times in the short span of 24 years.</description>

Dear Sir,
Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.
As you may be aware, the Islamic religious book, Koran, also spelt as ‘Qur’an’, said to be a collection of revelations made through the angel Gabriel by the almighty Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, containing numerous sayings, repeated in the book over and over again, which on grounds of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility, and though most of the events which had occasioned those sayings have now lost all historical significance, the book is still published in the unabridged form, with persistence, and clearly with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging or insulting other religions and the religious feelings of other communities in India which is apparent from the fact that all the publishers of the book know very well that the various sayings of the book are offensive in this sense." />

<p><strong>HIMANGSHU KISHORE’S LETTER</strong></p>
<p>From:<br>
Himangshu Kishore Chakraborty, M.A., (Cal.),<br>
12/A/4, Pashupati Bhattacharya Road,<br>
Behala,<br>
Calcutta - 34.</p>
<div align="right">
<p>Dated 20th July, 1984.</p>
</div>
<p>To,<br>
The Secretary,<br>
Department of Home,<br>
Government of West Bengal,<br>
Writers’ Building,<br>
Calcutta - 1.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.</strong></p>
<p>As you may be aware, the Islamic religious book, Koran, also spelt as
‘Qur’an’, said to be a collection of revelations made through the angel
Gabriel by the almighty Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, containing
numerous sayings, repeated in the book over and over again, which on
grounds of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and
ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to
commit violence and disturb public tranquility, and though most of the
events which had occasioned those sayings have now lost all historical
significance, the book is still published in the unabridged form, with
persistence, and clearly with the deliberate and malicious intention of
outraging or insulting other religions and the religious feelings of
other communities in India which is apparent from the fact that all the
publishers of the book know very well that the various sayings of the
book are offensive in this sense.</p>
<p>Some of these sayings are reproduced for your ready reference in the
three annexures enclosed to this letter.</p>
<p>As the publication of the book is thus an offence punishable under
Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code, each copy of the book,
whether in the original Arabic or in its translation in Urdu, Bengali,
Hindi, English or in any other language, is liable, in terms of Section
95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, to be declared to be
forfeited to the Government.</p>
<p>You are, therefore, requested to proscribe the book and, in the interest
of the public at large, to do so promptly.</p>
<div align="right">
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
Sd/-<br>
(Himangshu Kishore Chakraborty)</p>
</div>
<p>Enclo: As stated above.</p>

although it is bad for you.  Allah knows, but you do not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 41.<br>

**O Prophet!  Exhort the believers to fight.  If there are twenty

there are a hundred, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for
they are devoid of understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayat 66.<br>
**Now bath Allah lightened your burden, for He knoweth that there is
weakness in you.  So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they
shall vanquish two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand
steadfast they shall vanquish two thousand by permission of Allah.
Allah is with the steadfast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 47: ayats 4-15.<br>
**When you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield strike off their
heads and when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly.
Then grant them their freedom or take ransom from them, until war
shall lay down her armour.  Thus shall you do.  Had Allah willed, He
could Himself have punished them (without your help); but He has
ordained it thus that He might test you, the one by the other.  As
for those who are slain in the cause of Allah, He will not allow
their works to perish.  He will vouchsafe them guidance and ennoble
their state; He will admit them to the Paradise He has made known to
them.</p>
<p>Believers! if you help Allah, Allah will help you and make you
strong.  But the unbelievers shall be consigned to perdition.  He
will bring their deeds to nothing.  Because they have opposed His
revelations, He will frustrate their works…  Allah is the protector
of the faithful; unbelievers have no protector.  Allah will admit
those who embrace the true faith to gardens watered by running
streams.  The unbelievers take their full of pleasure and eat as the
beasts eat; but Hell shall be their home…  They shall abide in Hell
for ever and drink scalding water which will tear their bowels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayat 12.<br>
**I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels.  Strike off
their heads, maim them in every limb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 69: ayats 30-33.<br>
**We shall say, ‘Lay hold of him and bind him.  Bum him in the fire
of Hell, then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long.  For he
did not believe in Allah, the Most High.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayats 15-18.<br>
**Believers! when you encounter the armies of the infidels do not
turn your backs to them in flight.  If anyone on that day turns his
back to them, except it be for tactical reasons, or to join another
band, he shall incur the wrath of Allah and Hell shall be his home:
an evil fate.</p>
<p>It was not you, but Allah, who slew them.  It was not you who smote
them; Allah smote them so that He might richly reward the faithful.
He hears all and knows all.  He will surely thwart the designs of
the unbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 25: ayat 52.<br>
**Do not yield to the unbelievers, but fight them strenuously with
this Koran.</p>

**If you do not fight He will punish you sternly and replace you by
other men…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 111.<br>
**Allah has purchased of the faithful their lives and worldly goods
and in return has promised them the Garden.  They will fight for His
cause, slay and be slain.  Such is the true pledge which He has made
them in the Torah, the Gospel and the Koran.  And who is more true
to His promise than Allah?  Rejoice then in the bargain you have
made.  That is the supreme triumph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 3: ayats 169-171.<br>
**You must not think that those who were slain in the cause of Allah
are dead.  They are alive, and well provided for by their Lord;
pleased with His gifts and rejoicing that those whom they left
behind and who have not yet joined them have nothing to fear or to
regret; rejoicing in Allah’s grace and bounty.  Allah will not deny
the faithful their reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 4: ayat 100.<br>
**He that flies his homeland for the cause of Allah shall find
numerous places of refuge in the land and great abundance.  He that
leaves his dwelling to fight for Allah and His apostle and is then
overtaken by death, shall be rewarded by Allah.  Allah is forgiving
and merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 48: ayat 29.<br>
**Muhammad is Allah’s apostle.  Those who follow him are ruthless to
the unbelievers but merciful to one another…  Through them Allah
seeks to enrage the unbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 49: ayat 15.<br>
**The true believers are those that have faith in Allah and His
apostle and never doubt; and who fight for His cause with their
wealth and persons.  Such are those whose faith is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 2: ayat 154.<br>
**Do not say that those who were slain in the cause of Allah are
dead; they are alive, although you are not aware of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 3: ayats 157-158.<br>
**If you should die or be slain in the cause of Allah, His
forgiveness and His mercy would surely be better than all the riches
they amass.  If you should die or be slain, before Him you shall all
be gathered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayats 59-60.<br>
**Let the unbelievers not think that they will escape Us.  They have
not the power to do so.  Muster against them all the men and cavalry
at your disposal, so that you may strike terror into the enemies of
Allah and the faithful, and others besides them.  All that you give
for the cause of Allah shall be repaid you.  You shall not be
wronged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayats 2-3.<br>
**…Allah will humble the unbelievers…  Allah and His apostle are
free from obligation to the idol-worshippers…  Proclaim a woeful
punishment to the unbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 29.<br>
**Fight against such of those to whom the Scriptures were given as
believe neither in Allah nor the Last Day, who do not forbid what
Allah and His apostle have forbidden, and do not embrace the true
faith, until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayat 67.<br>
**It is not for any Prophet to have captives until he has made
slaughter in the land…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 4: ayat 84.<br>
**So fight for the cause of Allah.  You are accountable for none but
yourself.  Rouse the faithful; perchance Allah will defeat the
unbelievers.  He is mightier and more truculent than they.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 29: ayat 6.<br>
**He that fights for Allah’s cause fights for himself…</p>
</li>

<p>**Surah 29: ayat 69.<br>
**Those that fight for Our cause We will surely guide to our own
paths.  Allah is with the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 61: ayats 9-13.<br>
**It is He who has sent His messenger with the guidance and the
Religion of Truth, so that He may make it the conqueror of all
religions, much as the idol-worshippers may dislike it.</p>
<p>Believers!  Shall I point out to you a profitable course that will
save you from a woeful scourge?  Have faith in Allah and His apostle
and fight for His cause with your wealth and your persons.  That
would be best for you, if you but knew it.  He will forgive you your
sins and admit you to gardens watered by running streams; He will
lodge you in pleasant mansions in the gardens of Eden.  That is the
supreme triumph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 36.<br>
**Allah ordained the months twelve in number when He created the
Heavens and the earth.  Of these four (Dhi-Qa’ada, Dhul-Hajja,
Muharram and Rajab) are sacred according to the true faith.
Therefore do not sin against yourselves by violating them.  But you
may fight against the idolaters in all these months since they
themselves fight against you in all of them.  Know that Allah is
with the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 5.<br>
**When the sacred months are over slay the idol-worshippers wherever
you find them.  Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush
everywhere for them.  If they repent and take to prayer and pay the
alms-tax, let them go their way.  Allah is forgiving and merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayat 14.<br>
**Fight them!  Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will
lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the
breasts of folk who are believers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 9: ayats 20-22.<br>
**Those that have embraced the faith and fled their homes and fought
for Allah’s cause with their wealth and their persons are held in
higher regard by Allah.  It is they who shall triumph.  Their Lord
has promised them joy and mercy, and gardens of eternal pleasures
where they shall dwell for ever.  Allah’s reward is great indeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 4: ayats 95-96.<br>
**The believers who stay at home - apart from those that suffer from
a grave impediment - are not equal to those -who fight for the cause
of Allah with their goods and their persons.  Allah has given those
that fight with their goods and their persons a higher rank than
those who stay at home.  He has promised all a good reward: but far
richer is the recompense of those who fight for Him: rank of His own
bestowal, forgiveness, and mercy.  Allah is forgiving and merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Surah 8: ayats 72-74.<br>
**Those that have embraced the faith and fled their homes, fought
for the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons; and
those that sheltered them and helped them, shall be friends to each
other… they are the true believers.  They shall receive mercy and
generous provision.</p>

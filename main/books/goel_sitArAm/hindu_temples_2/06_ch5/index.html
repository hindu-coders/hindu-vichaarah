SPREADING THE BIG LIE
According to the Marxist professors “what is really required is an investigation into the theory that both the Dera Keshav Rai temple and the Idgah were built on the site of a Buddhist monastery which appears to have been destroyed.” Thank God, they have suggested it only as a theory; elsewhere in their writings they have not been that cautious.

  <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPREADING THE BIG LIE</strong></p>
<p>According to the Marxist professors “what is really required is an
investigation into the theory that both the Dera Keshav Rai temple and
the Idgah were built on the site of a Buddhist monastery which appears
to have been destroyed.” Thank God, they have suggested it only as a
theory; elsewhere in their writings they have not been that cautious. In
fact, they have gone out of their way in spreading the Big Lie that the
Hindus destroyed many Buddhist and Jain temples and monasteries in the
pre-Islamic past. They have never been able to cite more than
half-a-dozen instances of dubious veracity. But that has sufficed for
providing a vociferous plank in the “progressive” party line. “If the
descendants of Godse,” writes the executive editor of a prestigious
Marxist monthly, “think that every medieval mosque has been built after
demolishing some temple, why should we stop at the medieval period?
After all, Hindu kings had also got a large number of Jain and Buddhist
temples destroyed. The KrishNa temple at Mathutã rose on the ruins of a
Buddhist monastery. There are hundreds of such places (that is, Hindu
temples built on the ruins of Buddhist and Jain places of worship) in
Karnataka, Rajasthãn, Bihãr and Uttar Pradesh.”^(<a href="#1">1</a>) The author of
the article did not think it necessary to quote some instances. The
proposition, he thought, was self-evident. Herr Goebbles, too, never
felt the need of producing any evidence in support of his
pronouncements.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that some Buddhist and Jain scholars have swallowed
this lie without checking the quality and quantity of the evidence
offered. Some of these “scholars” are known for their “progressive”
inclinations. But there are others who have become victims of a
high-powered propaganda. The happiest people, however, have been the
Christian missionaries and the apologists of Islam. Does it not, they
say, blow up the bloody myth that Hinduism has a hoary tradition of
religious tolerance and that all religions coexisted peacefully in this
country before the advent of Islam and Christianity? We shall examine
this canard exhaustively at a later stage in this study. For the present
we are confining ourselves to the “evidence” offered in the context of
the Kešavadeva temple. We reproduce below the relevant reports of the
Archaeological Survey of India.</p>
<p>“In 1853,” writes Dr. J. Ph. Vogel, “regular explorations were started
by General Cunningham on the KaTrã and continued in 1862. They yielded
numerous sculptural remains; most important among them is an inscribed
standing Buddha image (height 3’6”) now in the Lucknow Museum. From the
inscription it appears that this image was presented to the Yašã-Vihãra
in the Gupta year 230 (AD 549-50)…^(<a href="#2">2</a>)</p>
<p>“The last archaeological explorations at Mathura were carried out by Dr.
Fuhrer between the year 1887 and 1896. His chief work was the excavation
of the Kañkãlî Tîlã in the three seasons of 1888-91. He explored also
the KaTrã site. Unfortunately, no account of his researches is
available, except the meager information contained in his Museum Reports
for those years… The plates of which only a few are reproductions of
photographs and the rest drawings, illustrate the sculptures acquired in
the course of Dr. Fuhrer’s excavations but do not throw much fight on
the explorations themselves &hellip;^(<a href="#3">3</a>)</p>
<p>“He [Cunningham] proposes to identify Kesopura, the quarter in which
the KaTrã is situated, with ‘the Klisobora or Kaisobora of Arrian and
the Calisobora of Pliny.’ It is, however, evident that the Mohalla
Kesopura was named after the shrine of Keso or Kesab (Skt. Kešava)
Dev. This temple stood, as we noticed above, on the ruins of a Buddhist
monastery which still existed in the middle of the sixth century. It is,
therefore, highly improbable that the name Kesopura goes back to the
days of Arrian.^(<a href="#4">4</a>)</p>
<p>“All we can say from past explorations is the following: The KaTrã must
have been the site of a Buddhist monastery named the Yašã-Vihãra which
was still extant in the middle of the sixth century. It would seem that
in the immediate vicinity there existed a stûpa to which the Bhûtesar
railing pillars belong. Dr. Fuhrer mentions indeed in one of his reports
that, in digging at the back of Aurangzeb’s mosque, he struck the
procession path of a stûpa bearing a dedicatory inscription.”^(<a href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p>Dr. Vogel returned to the theme in 1911-12. He wrote:</p>
<p>“The Keshab-Dev temple, of which the foundation can still clearly be
traced stood again on earlier remains of Buddhist origin. This became at
once apparent from General Cunningham’s explorations on this site in the
years 1853 and 1862, which opened the era of archaeological research at
Mathurã. Among his finds was a standing Buddha image (4’3.5”), now in
the Lucknow Museum, bearing an inscription, which is dated in the Gupta
year 230 (AD 549-50) and records that the image was dedicated by the
Buddhist nun JayabhaTTã at the Yašã-Vihãra.</p>
<p>“Several Buddhist sculptures, mostly of the KushãNa period have since
been discovered in the KaTrã mound. So that there can be little doubt,
that it marks the site of an important monastic establishment. It was
particularly ‘one’ find which seemed to call for further investigation.
Dr. Fuhrer while describing his last exploration of the year 1896 on the
KaTrã, says the following, ‘About 50 paces to the north of this plinth
[of the Kešavadeva Temple] I dug a trail trench, 80 feet long, 20 feet
broad and 25 feet deep, in the hope of exposing the foundations and some
of the sculptures of this Kešava temple. However, none of the hoped for
Brahmanical sculptures and inscriptions were discovered, but only
fragments belonging to an ancient stûpa. At a depth of 20 feet I came
across a portion of the circular procession-path leading round this
stûpa. On the pavement, composed of large red sandstone slabs, a short
dedicatory inscription was discovered, according to which this stûpa,
was repaired in samvat 76 by the Kushana King Vasushaka; unfortunately,
I was unable to continue the work and lay bare the whole
procession-path, as the walls of the brick structure, adjoining the
Masjid are built right across the middle of this stûpa.’</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the inscription referred to by Dr. Fuhrer was never
published, nor were estampages of it known to exist. Since the discovery
of the inscribed sacrificial post (yûpa) of Isãpur had established the
fact that between Kanishka and Huvishka there reigned a ruler of the
name of Vãsishka, it became specially important to verify the
particulars given by Dr. Fuhrer in the above quoted note.</p>
<p>“The endeavours made by Pandit Radha Krishna to recover Dr. Fuhrer’s
inscription were not crowned with success. It is true, however, that on
the spot indicated the remains of a brick stûpa honeycombed by the
depredations of contractors came to light. This monument, however,
cannot be assigned a date earlier than about the sixth century of our
era. Of the circular procession path of red stone slabs mentioned in Dr.
Fuhrer’s report, no trace was found, but at a much higher level there
was a straight causeway of stone referable to about the 12th or 13th
century AD. Evidently it has nothing whatsoever to do with the stûpa.
The causeway in question, which is 48’ long, 4’ 6” wide, runs straight
from north to south and is constructed of large sandstone slabs roughly
dressed and apparently obtained from different quarries. The size of
these stones shows considerable variations, one measuring 6’6” by 1’6”
by 9” and another 4’ 7” by 1’7” by 9”. The causeway consists of a double
layer of these slabs laid three by three, the whole being very
irregular. The slabs were bound with iron clamps, some of which still
remain. Five of the stones are marked with a trident (trišûl).</p>
<p>“In course of excavation numerous sculptural fragments came to light
mostly of a late date and apparently decorative remains of the Kesab Deb
temple destroyed by Aurangzeb. Among earlier finds I wish only to
mention a broken fourfold Jaina image (pratimã sarvato bhadrikã) with a
fragmentary inscription in Brãhmî of the Kushan period.”^(<a href="#6">6</a>)</p>
<p>A persual of these reports yields the following facts and conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. General Cunningham’s surmise about a Buddhist monastery being
buried in the KaTrã mound was no more than a mere speculation. The
speculation was based on the discovery of a loose sculpture and not on
the laying bare of any foundations or other remains of a monastery.
Can the subsequent discovery of a Jain sculpture at the same site be
relied upon to say that a Jain monastery also lies buried there? It
has to be noted, that in Mathura many Brahmanical sculptures and
architectural fragments have been found on sites such as the Jamãlpur
and Kañkãlî mounds which are definitely known as Buddhist and Jain
sites on the basis of foundations of monasteries etc., discovered
there. No one has ever speculated that the Buddhist and Jain monuments
at these sites were built on the ruins of Brahmanical
temples.^(<a href="#7">7</a>)</p>
<p>2. Dr. Vogel rejected General Cunningham’s identification of the
KaTrã site with Kesopura on the basis of the latter’s speculation that
a Buddhist monastery was buried under the Kešavadeva temple. This was
tantamount to proving what he had already assumed. With equal logic,
he could have rejected General Cunningham’s speculation about a
Buddhist monastery and confirmed his identification of the KaTrã site
with Kesopura. It seems that a pro-Buddhist and anti-Brahmanical bias,
which was as dominant in his days as it is in our own, was responsible
for his arbitrary choice from two equally plausible speculations on
the part of the same explorer, namely, General Cunningham.</p>
<p>3. That a stûpa existed in the vicinity of the Kešvadeva temple is
clear from the findings of Dr. Fuhrer as well as Pandit Radha Krishna.
But Dr. Fuhrer’s discovery of a circular procession path belonging to
the stûpa and passing under the KaTrã mound was not confirmed by the
digging undertaken by Pandit Radha Krishna. It seems that the large
sandstone slabs which Dr. Fuhrer construed as belonging to the
procession path of the stûpa belonged in fact to the causeway which
was uncovered by Pandit Radha Krishna and which had nothing whatsoever
to do with the stûpa. Obviously, Dr. Fuhrer was misled into another
speculation because of his reliance on the earlier speculation by
General Cunningham.</p>
<p>4. Dr. Fuhrer had surmised that the stûpa was repaired in the reign
of Vãsishka, that is, in the first decade of the second century AD.
This he had done on the basis of an inscription he claimed to have
read on a slab in what he thought to be the circular procession path
of the stûpa. He is not known to have copied the inscription, nor has
it ever been published. Pandit Radha Krishna who excavated in 1911-12
with the specific purpose of discovering that inscription failed not
only to find it but also the circular procession path. What is more,
the stûpa which was the same as that seen by Dr. Fuhrer could not be
assigned to a date earlier than the sixth century AD, that is, four
centuries after the reign of Vãsishka!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the picture which emerges from the explorations and excavations
undertaken at the KaTrã site by General Cunningham in 1853 and 1862, Dr.
Fuhrer in 1896, and Pandit Radha Krishna in 1911-12. There is no
positive evidence about the existence of a Buddhist edifice in the KaTrã
mound. All that can be said is that a Buddhist stûpa was built in the
vicinity of the site some time in the sixth century.</p>
<p>No trace of a Buddhist monastery or any other Buddhist monument was
found in the extensive exploration and excavation undertaken by the
Archaeological Survey of India at the KaTrã site during 1954-55,
1973-74, 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77. None of the archaeologists who
undertook the diggings has subscribed to the theory propounded earlier
by General Cunningham, Dr. Fuhrer and Dr. Vogel and now by the Marxist
professors. “Thirty eight sculptures,” wrote R.C. Sharma in 1984, “saw
their way to the Mathurã Museum in July 1954 when Sri K.D. Vajpeyi
(later Professor) was the Curator. They were unearthed as a result of
levelling and digging of the KaTrã site for renovating the birthplace of
Lord KRSNa and were made over to the Museum by the Janmabhûmi Trust.
Some other objects which were casually picked up by others from KaTrã
site were also acquired. The finds include terra-cottas from Mauryan to
Gupta periods, a few brick panels with creeper designs and several
Brãhmanical objects ranging from Gupta to early Medieval age. The number
of fragments of ViSNu figures is quite considerable and this suggests
that a big VaiSNava or Bhãgvata complex once stood on the
site.”^(<a href="#8">8</a>)</p>
<p>The controversy should stand closed with what Professor Heinrich Luders,
the great expert on Mathura, has to say on the subject. “Considering the
well-known untrustworthiness of Dr. Fuhrer’s reports,” he writes, “there
can be no doubt that the VasuSka inscription is only a product of his
imaginations.”^(<a href="#9">9</a>) Steven Rosen has accused Dr. Vogel of
“attempted forgery” in editing the Morã Well inscription discovered by
Cunningham in 1882. “Many early archaeologists in India,” he writes,
‘were Christian - and they made no bones about their
motivation.”^(<a href="#10">10</a>) He adds, “Dr. Vogel in attempting to distort
the Morã Well inscription was right in the line with many of his
predecessors in the world of Indology and archaeology.”^(<a href="#11">11</a>)</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>It is welcome that the professors are prepared for an investigation for
finding whether the KaTrã mound hides the remains of a Buddhist
monastery under the remains of the Kešavadeva temple. Only a thorough
excavation of the site on which the Îdgãh stands can settle the
question. But it must be pointed out that the excavation may not stop at
the Buddhist monastery if it is uncovered at all. If it is true, as they
say, that Hindus and Buddhists were at daggers drawn in the pre-Islamic
period, they should be prepared for the possibility that the Buddhist
monastery itself was built on the ruins of an earlier Hindu temple.
After all, the most ancient and prolific Indian literature associates
Mathura with the birth and youth of Šrî KrishNa, while the Buddhist
associations with Mathura do not go beyond Greek and KushãNa times. We
have already quoted Romila Thapar regarding the Kešvadeva tradition
going back to the Mauryan period. It is quite plausible on the
hypothesis of the professors that some Greek or KushãNa patron of
Buddhism destroyed a Hindu temple which stood at Šrî KrishNa’s place of
birth before he raised a Buddhist monastery on the site. Of course, we
do not subscribe to this story of Hindu-Buddhist conflict. There is no
evidence that the Hindus ever destroyed a Buddhist place of worship or
vice versa.  We are only proposing a test for the Marxist hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is intriguing indeed that whenever archaeological evidence points
towards a mosque as standing on the site of a Hindu temple, our Marxist
professors start seeing a Buddhist monastery buried underneath. They
also invent some Šaiva king as destroying Buddhist and Jain shrines
whenever the large-scale destruction of Hindu temples by Islamic
invaders is mentioned. They never mention the destruction of big
Buddhist and Jain complexes which dotted the length and breadth of
India, Khurasan, and Sinkiang on the eve of the Islamic invasion, as
testified by Hüen Tsang. We should very much like to know from them as
to who destroyed the Buddhist and Jain temples and monasteries at
Bukhara, Samarqand, Khotan, Balkh, Bamian, Kabul, Ghazni, Qandhar,
Begram, Jalalabad, Peshawar, Charsadda, Ohind, Taxila, Multan,
Mirpurkhas, Nagar-Parkar, Sialkot, Srinagar, Jalandhar, Jagadhari, Sugh,
Tobra, Agroha, Delhi, Mathura, Hastinapur, Kanauj, Sravasti, Ayodhya,
Varanasi, Sarnath, Nalanda, Vikramasila, Vaishali, Rajgir, Odantapuri,
Bharhut, Champa, Paharpur, Jagaddal, Jajnagar, Nagarjunikonda, Amravati,
Kanchi, Dwarasamudra, Devagiri, Bharuch, Valabhi, Girnar, Khambhat
Patan, Jalor, Chandravati, Bhinmal, Didwana, Nagaur, Osian, Ajmer,
Bairat, Gwalior, Chanderi, Mandu, Dhar, etc., to mention only the more
prominent ones. The count of smaller Buddhist and Jain temples destroyed
by the swordsmen of Islam runs into hundreds of thousands. There is no
dearth of mosques and other Muslim monuments which have buried in their
masonry any number of architectural and sculptural pieces from Buddhist
and Jain monuments.</p>
<p>It is not so long ago that Western scholars, even Christian
missionaries, used to credit the Hindus at least with one virtue,
namely, religious tolerance. Hindus had received universal acclaim for
providing refuge and religious freedom to the Jews, the Christians, and
the Parsis who had run away from persecutions at the hands of Christian
and Islamic rulers in West Asia and Iran. It was also conceded that
though Brahmanical, Buddhist and Jain sects and subsects had had heated
discussions among themselves and used even strong language for their
adversaries, the occasions when they exchanged physical blows were few
and far between. The recent spurt of accusations that Hindus also were
bigots and vandals like Christians and Muslims, seems to be an
after-thought. Apologists who find it impossible to whitewash
Christianity and Islam, are out to redress the balance by blackening
Hinduism. Till recently, the Marxists were well-known for compiling
inventories of capitalist sins in order to hide away the crimes
committed in Communist countries.</p>
<p>The professors see some retributive justice in the destruction of the
Kešavadeva temple by Aurangzeb because they believe that the temple was
built on the ruins of a Buddhist monastery destroyed by the Hindus in
the pre-Islamic past. It does not speak very highly of whatever moral
sense the professors may possess that they should justify or explain
away the wrong done by someone during one period in terms of another
wrong done by someone else at some distant date. The whole argument is
tantamount to saying that the murder of A by B is justified or should be
explained away because the great-great-great grandfather of A had
murdered C!</p>
<p>But after all is said about the Marxist professors, we must admit the
merit of their last point, namely, “the question of limits to the logic
of restoration of religious sites.” Our plea is that the question can be
answered satisfactorily only when we are prepared to face facts and a
sense to proportion is restored. That is exactly what this study intends
to do.</p>

<p><a href="#7a">⁷</a> How much mistaken General Cunningham could be in his
speculations sometimes is shown by Dr. R.C. Sharma who has been a
Curator of the Museum at Mathura. “Sir Alexander Cunningham,” he writes,
“during his first exploration in 1853 found some pillars of a Buddhist
railing at the site of KaTra Keshavadev renowned as birthplace of Lord
KRSna. Later he recovered a gateway from the same spot and a standing
Buddha figure from a well recording the name of the monastery as Yasã
Vihãra. He remarks, ‘I made the first discovery of Buddhist remains at
the temple of Kesau Ray in January 1853, when, after a long search I
found a broken pillar of a Buddhist railing sculptured with the figure
of Mãyã Devî standing under the Sãla tree’. Cunningham was mistaken when
he identified the lady on railing as Mãyã Devî. Since it was the first
discovery he thought the representation conveyed some special event. Now
we know that the lady under tree was a common representation on the rail
posts of KuSãNa period and it does not specifically represent Mãyã Devî”

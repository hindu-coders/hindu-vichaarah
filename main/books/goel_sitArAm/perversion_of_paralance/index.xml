      <description>CHAPTER 1 - Something Seriously Wrong Somewhere It was the summer of 1959. I was working as secretary of an organisation of which the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan was the president. One day an RSS leader walked into my office. I had known him for a number of years. After some small talk, he suggested that I should request J.P. to visit an RSS camp which was being held in New Delhi at that time.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 2 - Words Which Defy Dictionaries As one surveys India&amp;rsquo;s political parlance the first features one notices is that while certain people and parties are described as Leftist, certain others are designated as Righist. Once in a while, political scientists and journalists add nuances to this broad bracketing when they pronounce some splinter group as Left or Right of Centre. But one is left guessing about the location of the Centre itself.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 3 - The Sources Of Leftist Language Leftist professors and publicists claim that their language got formulated in the course of India&amp;rsquo;s fight for freedom from British rule. They also claim that this language was used in the field at various stages of the struggle for freedom. This is a plain and a big lie. The annals of that freedom struggle provide no evidence that this language was used in India&amp;rsquo;s politics till the late thirties of this century.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 4 - The Character of Leftist Language Ever since its inauguration in the opening years of this century, the language of Leftism has been the loudest in denouncing this or that imperialism. Quite often, it has imagined or invented an imperialism where none existed. This exercise has helped it to hide the fact that it itself is the latest language of imperialism.
Imperialism down the ages has evolved and employed a number of languages.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 5 - The History of Leftist Language Leftist language first came to India as the language of Communist imperialism. Its main spokesman was M.N. Roy. In his &amp;ldquo;India in Transition&amp;rdquo;, published in 1922, he laid down practically all fundamental formulations which, in due course, became the stock-in-trade of India&amp;rsquo;s Leftist parties. The language of these formulations is still the language of Leftism.
It will facilitate an understanding of Roy&amp;rsquo;s formulations if we summarise briefly the background of Indian nationalism as it had developed prior to that period.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 6 - The Role of Leftist Language The language of Communist imperialism continued to lambast the Congress leadership, particularly Mahatma Gandhi for the latter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;failure to mobilize the toiling masses towards an immediate overthrow of the British rule in India.&amp;quot; But when the Congress launched a mass movement in March, 1930, the spokesmen of this language kept strictly aloof from it. Instead they published a Draft Plam of Action in December, 1930 characterising the Congress as a &amp;ldquo;class organisation of the capitalists working against the fundamental interests of the toiling masses.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 7 - The Place of Mahatma Gandhi The language of British and Christian imperialism had stood fully exposed for what they were in essence by the time tht Swadeshi Movement swept forward after the Partition of Bengal in 1905. The language of Islamic imperialism had revived but was not resounding enough as yet to ring bells in the minds of national leaders. And the language of Communist imperialism had not yet appeared on the scene.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 8 - Towards A Language of Indian Nationalism We have seen in the foregoing chapters, that India&amp;rsquo;s prevalent political parlance - Right and Left, Reactionary and Progressive Revivalist and Revolutionary, Fascist and Democratic, Communal and Secular, Capitalist and Socialist,, etc. &amp;ndash; is an alien imposition imported mostly from Soviet Russia by a fifth-column of Communist imperialism. We have also seen how this language shares its basic characteristic with the languages of Islamic, Christian and British imperialism.</description>

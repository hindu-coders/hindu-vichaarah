The Trap and the Way Out
It was my intention to include in this series a few essays on Hindu Sociology and Hindu History as I see them after many years of study and reflection. But these themes would have to wait for some time. I will return to them later and discuss them with reference to Hindu Spirituality as I have presented it so far.

<strong>The Trap and the Way Out</strong></p>
<p>It was my intention to include in this series a few essays on Hindu
Sociology and Hindu History as I see them after many years of study and
reflection. But these themes would have to wait for some time. I will
return to them later and discuss them with reference to Hindu
Spirituality as I have presented it so far.</p>
<p>I have received many letters from the readers of this series as I did
when I wrote some earlier ones. Most of the readers have appreciated
what I have said. A few friends have reacted against my repudiation of
Monotheism. It has not been possible for me to reply to these readers
individually in spite of a strong desire to do so. But I have felt
immensely encouraged. The appreciation as well criticism confirms that
there is a large number of my countrymen who are conscious of their
spiritual and cultural heritage, and who are moved by more than mundane
matters.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, I should like to summarise what I have said so far in
the context of Hindu Spirituality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Hindu society has been sustained by its spiritual center
throughout the ages, particularly in the face of Islamic and Christian
barbarism. Countless Hindu heroes and heroines have defied death
rather than renounce their ancestral religion. Hindu society will be
revived and revitalised only by recovering its spiritual centre which
is Sanãtana Dharma.</p>
<p>2. Hindu society has been thrown on the defensive by blood-soaked
bigotries, clay-footed creeds, and a mercenary modernist culture
because Hindu society is suffering from self-forgetfulness. A
re-awakened Hindu society will not evaluate its own heritage in terms
of ideas and ideals projected by imperialist ideologies. On the
contrary, Hindu society will process these ideologies in terms of its
own vision and world-view. That will restore the self-confidence of
Hindu society as also Hindu pride in the ancient Hindu heritage.</p>
<p>3. The self-forgetfulness of Hindu society is symbolized by a
wide-spread misinterpretation of the Vedic verse <em>ekam sad viprãh
bahudhã vadanti</em> to mean that the Vedas also advocate Monotheism. This
misinterpretation is motivated by a psychology of surrender as
signified by the Hindu slogan of <em>sarva-dharma-samabhãva</em> vis-a-vis
Christianity and Islam. A psychology of imitation is also at work. It
has led some Sikh theologians to cast into monotheistic moulds the
Vaishnava spirituality of the <em>Ãdigrantha</em>.</p>
<p>4. Monotheistic creeds like Christianity and Islam view Sanãtana
Dharma as chaos and anarchy because Sanãtana Dharma does not (1) swear
by a historical prophet or saviour, (2) grant a monopoly of truth to a
book (<em>al-kitãb</em>), (3) prop up a True One God against False Many Gods,
and (4) seek the intercession of a prophet or saviour for escape from
an eternal hell and get admitted into an eternal heaven. But that is
not the fault of Sanãtana Dharma. That indicates only the limitations
from which the monotheistic mind suffers. A monotheist feels lost in
the spiritual freedom of Sanãtana Dharma like a Soviet citizen who
fails to understand the functioning of a democratic society.</p>
<p>5. Evaluated by Sanãtana Dharma, Christianity and Islam turn out to
be constructs of the outer human mind, drawing upon dark drives of the
unregenerate unconscious. Sanãtana Dharma stands for self-exploration,
self-purification, and self-transcendence, while Islam and
Christianity stand for self-stupefaction, self-righteousness, and
self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p>6. The central message of Sanãtana Dharma is that (1) the spiritual
aspiration for absolute Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Power is inherent
in every human being, everywhere, and at all times, (2) the spiritual
striving cannot come to rest till a seeker overcomes all limitations
of human and universal nature, and emerges as master of himself as
well as of the universe, and (3) the way to world-discovery and
God-discovery is through self-discovery. At the same time, Sanãtana
Dharma proclaims that there are as many ways of spiritual seeking as
there are seekers, and that spiritual seeking does not express itself
in any single and set doctrine or dogma. This is the basis of true
universalism enshrined in Sanãtana Dharma, as opposed to the
counterfeit universalism of Christianity and Islam which prescribes
one fixed, fossilized, and uniform system of belief and behaviour for
everyone.</p>
<p>7. Sanãtana Dharma is ingrained in the Hindu psyche which sees the
same divinity in everything and everywhere, and which invests our
entire environment with innumerable Gods and Goddesses. The mullah and
the missionary denounce this Hindu psyche as poisoned by Pantheism and
Polytheism. But that is the language of Monotheism which is incapable
of understanding any type of spirituality whatsoever. Monotheism is
disguised materialism which makes God extra-cosmic and denies divinity
to God’s creation. The God of Monotheism is soon replaced by the only
son or the last prophet who, in turn, is replaced by a monolithic
Church or Ummah out to conquer the world by force and fraud.</p>
<p>8. Hindu spiritual consciousness is expressed in terms of a plurality
of Gods. These Gods are many a time symbolized by concrete images such
as Sûrya, Agni, Marut, etc. This is because Sanãtana Dharma allows
many variations on the same spiritual theme, and does not put Matter
in an irreconcilable opposition to Spirit. The forms and features of
Hindu icons have a source higher than the normal reaches of the human
mind. Idol-worship is the only way by which the sense-bound human mind
reaches something of the higher spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>9. History is a witness that the spiritual consciousness of mankind
everywhere had expressed itself in a plurality of Gods and in
widespread idol-worship, before Christianity and Islam destroyed many
ancient religions by fire and sword and imposed monotheistic
materialism on large sections of mankind. Hindu spirituality which
still retains its ancient intuition and genius, has to help many
societies in Asia, Africa, America, Europe and Oceania to reject these
impositions and revive their old Gods. That is the only path towards
their spiritual and cultural emancipation from the imperialist and
inhuman yoke of Christianity and Islam.</p>
<p>10. Monotheism of Christianity and Islam is not only an impediment on
the path of spiritual progress, it also divides mankind into warring
camps by giving currency to a number of hate-filled words such as
infidel, <em>kãfir</em>, heretic, idolater, polytheist, etc. What is worse,
Monotheism promotes the most degenerate type of idolatry by
manufacturing myths and miracles about its all-too-human apostles and
prophets, saints and sufis, and by seeing the supernatural in dirt and
dross such as the hair, the saliva, the shoe, the shirt, and the
shroud. It expects the idols of the infidels to perform the same
supernatural miracles, and breaks them when the miracles are not
forthcoming. Monotheism thus turns out to be the most abominable
superstition.</p>
<p>11. Hindu sages and seers could tap the sources of universal
spirituality because they did not start with an <em>a priori</em> assumption
of an Almighty God as the creator and controller of the cosmos. Their
starting point was the human person. That is why Hindu spiritual
literature abounds in psychological and psychic terms. Hindu sages and
seers explored human consciousness till they discovered the highest
dimension of humanhood. It is seldom that Hindu spirituality speaks in
the language of Theism. God as the creator and controller of the
cosmos is unknown to the Vedas, to the Upanishads, to Jainism, to
Buddhism, and to the six systems of Hindu philosophy. Hindu
spirituality never renounces its base in humanism; it only raises
humanism to its highest meaning and significance.</p>
<p>12. Christian mystics and Muslim sufis continued to travel on the
same path of universal spirituality because the new creeds sat lightly
on them, and discovered the true fount of freedom from bondage. But
Christianity and Islam used the power of theocratic states to suppress
this natural and spontaneous mysticism and sufism. In due course, the
mystics and sufis were made to serve the imperial establishments of
the Church and the Ummah, and they became degenerate accomplices of
predatory imperialism. Hindu spirituality has to rescue Christian
mysticism from the clutches of Christian theology, and salvage sufism
from servitude to prophetic Islam. That is the only basis on which
Hindu society can come to terms with Christian and Muslim communities
in India.</p>
<p>13. The true character of Christian theology and prophetic Islam is
revealed when one studies the genesis of Christianity and Islam in the
Gospels and biographies of the Prophet. Such a study leaves no doubt
that Christianity and Islam are not religions but political ideologies
pregnant with imperialist ambitions. Their appetite has been whetted
by their conquest of a large part of the world by the power of the
sword. Hindu society is making a serious mistake in treating
Christianity and Islam as religions, and by extending to them the same
<em>samabhãva</em> as has always prevailed among the various sects of
Sanãtana Dharma.</p>
<p>14. Hindu society has never had an established church, nor ever known
a theocratic state. This society has always been a secular society.
This society, therefore, does not need lectures on Secularism such as
are delivered to it daily by the Nehruvian ruling class. An honest
Secularism would have addressed itself to Christianity and Islam which
are the strongholds of exclusiveness and the advocates of a theocratic
state. This has not happened because the Nehruvian brand of Secularism
arose out of surrender to Islamic separatism. Having failed to
overcome Islamic separatism, a section of the national movement,
particularly the Leftists under the leadership of Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru, blamed their own frustration on what they called Hindu
communalism. As a consequence, Nehruvian Secularism is no more than
the embodiment of an anti-Hindu animus. The secularists serve as the
sappers and miners of Islamic and Christian imperialism. They are also
encouraging the imperialism of an Islamicized Akali clique which has
been allowed to control <em>gurudwara</em> revenues and thereby dominate Sikh
society which is only a section of the larger Hindu society.</p>
<p>15. Hindu society should see through this perverted Secularism, and
reject it not only as a counterfeit coin but also as high treason to
the Indian nation. That is the only way to defeat the gangster game
which goes on all around Hindu society, and which threatens to reduce
it to a minority in its own ancestral homeland. The secularist who
accuses Hindu society of communalism is no more than a <em>thug</em> who
wants to hoodwink this society into believing that its nationalism is
communalism. He has to be unmasked and isolated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HINDU SOCIETY STANDS TRAPPED BY ITS OWN SLOGAN</strong></p>
<p>What is the situation at present?</p>
<p>The Hindu elite continues to shout its slogan of
<em>sarva-dharma-samabhãva</em> vis-a-vis Christianity and Islam. It is rare to
meet a member of the Hindu elite who does not shout from the housetops
that Christianity and Islam are as good religions as his own Sanãtana
Dharma. There is no dearth of dim-witted but sanctimonious scholars who
line up quotations from the Bible and the Quran alongside quotations
from Hindu shastras in order to prove the “essential unity of all
religions”. Matters have come to such a pass that a Hindu who does not
subscribe to this slogan suffers ostracism from the elite circles of
Hindu society. Hindu politicians are the worst culprits. They are
mortally afraid of being branded as “Hindu communalists”. And they have
neither the knowledge nor the courage to change the universe of public
discourse. The secularists have only to invent a new slogan, the Hindu
politicians are the first to fall in line. The only purpose they serve
is to keep Hindu society always on the defensive.</p>
<p>Neither the missionary nor the mullah subscribes to the slogan of
<em>sarva-dharma-samabhãva</em>. Each one of them is convinced and proclaims
publicly that his own creed is the only true one, and that to equate it
with Sanãtana Dharma is the height of blasphemy. Each of them claims
that Hindu society cannot stop him from converting as many Hindus as he
can, by all means including force and fraud, without repudiating its own
slogan and thus knocking the very bottom out of Secularism. Every Hindu
objection to conversions, they say, exposes the Hindus as hypocrites who
do not mean what they say. But if you ask the Hindu leaders to renounce
this mischievous slogan, they denounce you as one who is trying to
upturn an established Hindu tradition. They do not know that this slogan
was coined by Mahatma Gandhi, and that it stood totally defeated in his
own life-time. The future of Hinduism and Hindu society is dark if this
is not debunked, and Islam and Christianity are allowed to march as they
are doing at present.</p>
<p>What is the treatment prescribed for Hindus in case Christianity or
Islam acquires state power in India? The prescription provided by the
missionary as well as the mullah is again unequivocal.</p>
<p>The mullah says: “Allah has mandated the lands of the infidels to his
last prophet who, in turn, has bequeathed them to the Ummah. India
continues to be a <em>Dar-ul-harb</em>. It is our Allah-ordained duty to
convert it into a <em>Dar-ul-Islãm</em>. Our scriptures prescribe a total
destruction of <em>kufr</em> (infidelism) and <em>shirk</em> (idolatry). Allah is very
jealous of his own position as the only one worthy of worship. He cannot
stand the sight of these Hindu idols imitating his majesty and trying to
share his divinity. These idols have to be destroyed and trodden under
the feet of the <em>mu‘mins</em> in order to propitiate Allah. The temples
which house these idols have to be demolished and converted into places
worthy of our own way of worship. We will, of course, invite all
idolaters in India to embrace Islam, willingly and voluntarily. But if
they do not come round of their own accord, we are afraid we shall have
to use force in furtherance of the only true faith. Allah had sent his
last prophet to save all mankind from perdition. The divine duty has
devolved on the Ummah after the departure of the Prophet. We cannot turn
traitors to his mission.”</p>
<p>If a Hindu protests at this revelation of the ‘divine duty’, he invites
an angry howl from the Ummah. And the whole of it thunders: “So you do
not want us to be true to our religion as revealed by Allah to his last
prophet, as enshrined in our sacred scripture, the Quran, and as
enjoined by our sacred tradition, the Sunnah? What sort of a Hindu are
you? Have you not read the books written by your own scholars and sages
such as Dr. Bhagwan Das, Pandit Sunderlal, Rahul Sankrityayan, and
Vinoba Bhave about the sublimity of Islam? Have you not heard the
lectures on <em>sarva-dharma-samabhãva</em> delivered by your own leaders, day
in and day out, and over all these so many years? It seems that you are
not secular. It looks as if you are a Hindu chauvinist out to deny to us
the fundamental right of religious freedom guaranteed by the
Constitution of the country. We appeal to you to shed your narrow Hindu
communalism, and be true to your Hindu Dharma. We assure you that we
shall not fail to be true to our Islam. This is the only basis on which
our two communities can coexist peacefully till, in due course, the true
faith triumphs.”</p>
<p>The Christian missionary also talks in the same vein, though his
language is less crude than that of the mullah, and his manners are more
sophisticated. His methods of salesmanship are more mature. Also, the
mullah is aggressive because he knows that a whole Islamic world
supports his onslaught against Hindu society and culture, and because he
finds that the Indian ruling class gets really frightened by his threats
to mobilize frenzied Muslim mobs for committing gangster acts. He has
demonstrated any number of times that his threats are not empty. The
Christian missionary, on the other hand, knows that he does not enjoy
such solid support in the West, and cannot mobilize Christian mobs on
the requite scale.</p>
<p>Hindu society is thus trapped by a slogan which it has itself coined and
made current countrywide. It is the same sort of trap in which a
democratic society finds itself the moment it grants that the Communist
fifth-column or a fascist phalanx is a legitimate political party
entitled to enjoy freedom to function and expand.</p>
<p><strong>THE WAY OUT</strong></p>
<p>What is the way out?</p>
<p>Hindu society has to realize that Christianity and Islam are not
religions but political ideologies inspired by imperialist ambitions.
These ideologies came to India as accomplices of Islamic and Western
armies. Those armies have been defeated and driven away. The ideologies
which came with those armies should now find no place in India. They,
too, have to be defeated and dispersed. Hindu society has to recover the
ground that was lost to these ideologies during periods of Islamic and
Christian expansion and domination. Those sections of Hindu society
which were forced or lured into the folds of these ideologies, have to
be brought back into their ancestral fold. This is the minimum task
which Hindu society has to set before itself. The maximum task is to
carry the campaign against these ideologies into their own homelands,
and to free large sections of mankind from the abominable superstitions
which breed intolerance and aggression.</p>
<p>The cultural climate in the modern West is favourable for the spread of
Sanãtana Dharma. The West has repudiated Christianity and returned to
rationalism, humanism and universalism, all of which are values
cherished and promoted by the Hindu view of life. But the West does not
realize that the massive finances which the Christian missions collect
over there in the name of doing social service in “a poor, starved,
diseased and illiterate India” is used by the missions for the nefarious
work of subverting the only sane society which has survived the
depredations of genocidal creeds. Hindu society, particularly the Hindus
settled or working in the West, have to provide this information to the
West so that the menace of Christian missions is challenged in their own
homelands.</p>
<p>It is true that Christian missions are involved in the foreign policy
manoeuvers and intelligence networks of the various Western nations. The
systematic building up of a Christian missionary like Mother Teresa by
the U.S. State Department provides an obvious pointer. But Western
foreign policy establishments are using Christian missions because Hindu
society has made them respectable in India. The day that respectability
is destroyed and Christianity and its missions are exposed for what they
are, the Western nations will have no use for them.</p>
<p>Islam is a harder nut to crack. The Islamic countries everywhere are
closed societies presided over by theocratic states which do not permit
any scrutiny of Islam or the propagation of a rational and humanist view
of life. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism in many Muslim lands has let
loose a reign of terror against all those enlightened sections which
have tried to free their people from the stranglehold of a fanatic
falsehood. The Western democracies, particularly the United States of
America, are encouraging this fanaticism in the fond hope that it will
stand as a bulwark against Soviet imperialism.^(<a href="#*">*</a>) A dark night
envelops the Islamic countries at present due to a combination of
historical circumstances, and there seems to be little hope that the
Muslim masses will be able to emancipate themselves in the near future.</p>
<p>But it is also a fact that the rise of fundamentalism in a closed creed
is a sign of panic, and sounds its death-knell. Christian fundamentalism
which surfaced in Europe in the form of Protestantism proved to be the
death-gasp of Christianity. For, fundamentalism brings to the fore, in
one fell sweep, all the crudities of a closed creed - crudities which
normally remain hidden under borrowed cultural trappings.</p>
<p>There is a large number of Muslim students, scholars, scientists
technicians, and other sections of Muslim intelligentsia who find no
place in their closed societies, and who have fled to other countries
including India. Here is a fertile field in which Hindu society can sow
some seeds which will bear fruit in due course. These refugees from
Islamic terrorism have to be convinced that it is not the politics of
their motherlands that has become perverse, it is the culture cultivated
by Islam which has poisoned their societies.</p>
<p>But before Hindu society can perform these minimum and maximum tasks, it
has to revive its own spiritual centre and reawaken to its own ancient
heritage. The rest will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p><a href="#*a">^(*)</a> The Soviet Union is dead and gone, but the US support for
Pakistan, one of the front rank promoters of Islamic fundamentalism and
terrorism, continues. The aim of US foreign policy now is no less than
the disintegration of the truncated Hindu homeland. Nehruvian
secularists are now waiting to be hired by the US establishment, as they
were by the Soviet establishment in the past.</p>

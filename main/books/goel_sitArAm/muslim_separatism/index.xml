      <description>CHAPTER I
THE TWO BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS
“Pakistan and Bangladesh are their fixed deposits. Those are Islamic states. No one else can lay a claim on them. India is a joint account. Plunder it as much as you please.”^(1) This is how Shri Shiva Prasad Roy, a very perceptive Bengali writer, has summed up the present situation in what is described as the Indian subcontinent now a days but what has been known as Bharatavarsha since time immemorial.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE NATIONAL TERRITORIAL TRADITION
The perspective of The Tragic Story of Partition by Shri H.V. Seshadri is set by what the learned author has written in his short but succinct Preface. He says: “In the [past] one thousand years many parts of our country had been ruled by the Muslims and then by the British, but the nation had never compromised, in principle, its sovereignty over any part of the motherland.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
THE NATIONAL HISTORICAL TRADITION
The Partition of India which the national leadership conceded in principle in 1947 was a gross violation of the national territorial tradition which had always cherished the whole of Bharatavarsha as a single and indivisible Hindu homeland. But what was still more serious, it was also a flagrant betrayal of the national historical tradition which had never accepted the consolidation of any foreign conquest in any part of Bharatavarsha as a settle fact, final for all time.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE BUSINESS OF BLAMING THE BRITISH
Problems have to be solved first at the level of thought before we can hope to solve them at the level of things. Hindu society has got to do some hard thinking in order to find an effective and lasting solution of the problem posed by Islam.
ISLAM AND HINDU SOCIETY
Islam came to India as a fully developed ideology of an aggressive and self-righteous imperialism.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
THE FRUSTRATION OF ISLAM IN INDIA
Long ago, some 12 or 13 years before Partition, I had a chance to pass by a meeting of Muslims in Delhi. The chaste Urdu and the weighty voice of the man making the speech at the moment, made me stand and stare. It was a bearded mullah wearing a fez. He was narrating some history which was new for me.
The mullah mentioned several dates on which some decisive battles had been fought and won by the armies of Islam.</description>

ISLAMIC ATAVISM RENAMED MUSLIM REVIVALISM
“He stayed for a good time in Medina,” writes Jablani, “and returned to Mecca in 1731, a little before the start of the Hajj season. Of course, he spent the whole month of Ramzan there and its last ten days in seclusion (itikat) in the sacred Mosque. During those hours of seclusion many secret truths were made clear to him and he was duly apprised of some difficult problems.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
JOURNEY FROM JIHÃD TO JEE-HUZÛRÎ
“It is obvious to your exalted self that the alien people from distant lands have become the rulers of territories and times, and the traders and vendors of goods have attained the rank of sovereignty. They have destroyed the dominions of the big grandees and the estates of the nobles of illustrious ranks, and their honour and authority have been completely set at naught… As soon as the land of Hindustan is cleared of the alien enemies and the efforts of these people [the Wahabis] result in the achievement of their objective, the ranks and offices of the state and government would be handed over to the seekers [of these], and the roots of their power and sovereignty would be strengthened.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
NATIONAL RESURGENCE REVILED AS HINDU REVIVALISM
Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati (1824-1883) was speaking at a meeting in Calcutta when some stones were thrown at him by some members of the audience disgruntled by his criticism of Hindu orthodoxy. He remained calm and self-possessed. He appealed for a patient hearing in the following words: “The British Government has guaranteed freedom of speech to all of us. Why should I be deprived of that freedom?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
LOSS OF PRIVILEGES PORTRAYED AS PRIVATION
A British scholar and civil servant, W.W. Hunter, wrote the book, The Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel against the Queen?, which was published in 1871. It was reviewed by Alfred Lyall who was soon to succeed as the Lieutenant Governor of the North West Province (later on known as U.P.). Lyall had warned that “what Hunter had said will be overheard by Indian Muslims; they will be encouraged to think of themselves as ‘an oppressed people or a persecuted sect’.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
THE SEPARATIST SEWER POLLUTES THE NATIONAL MAINSTREAM
There is one chapter in the history of our freedom movement against British imperialism which has caused considerable confusion. This chapter opened with the signing of the Lucknow Pact in December 1916, and closed with the withdrawal of the first Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi in February 1922. Many politicians and historians have looked back wistfully to those ‘wonderful days of Hindu-Muslim unity’ when the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League held their annual sessions in the same city and at the same time, passed similar anti-imperialist resolutions, and raised similar slogans.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XI
THE BEHAVIOUR PATTERN PATENTED BY ISLAM
On August 4, 1920, Mahatma Gandhi had written as follows in his Young India: “My advice to my Hindu brethren is: Simply help the Mussalmans in their sorrow in a generous and self-sacrificing spirit without counting the cost and you will automatically save the cow… Islam is a noble faith. Trust it and its followers. We must hold it a crime for any Hindu to talk to them about cow-protection or any other help in our religious matters, while the Khilafat struggle is going on.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XII
PLEA FOR A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Shri H.V. Seshadri has taken The Tragic Story of Partition to its fatal finale in 1947. Each of his chapters is packed with facts, insights, and interpretations such as make his book a substantial contribution to the large literature on this controversial subject. The only drawback in this otherwise well-documented study is the frequent absence of dates on which the books from which he has quoted were published, and the statements of leaders he has cited were made.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX
ISLAMIC MANIFESTO FOR INDIA
It is old. It is new. It is an enduring theme on which the Ulama and the Sufis of Islam thrive.
It is a rueful review of an opportunity lost in the past. It is a fond dream about a future fulfilment. It is a fanatic faith to fight for in the present.
Borrowing a metaphor from the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx, the theme can be summarised as well as sloganized as follows: “We, the Ulama and the Sufis of Islam, disdain to hide our aim.</description>

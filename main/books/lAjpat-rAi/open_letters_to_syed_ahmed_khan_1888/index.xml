LETTER ONE
Would you excuse me if I encroach upon your valuable time for a short while? Before I address you on the subject matter of discussion I think it advisable to state for your information that I have been a constant reader and admirer of your writings. From childhood, I was taught to respect the opinions and the teachings of the white-bearded Syed of Aligarh.</description>

LETTER TWO
It is more than two weeks now since my first letter was published, and I think I have waited long enough for the reply which, it seems, you have no mind to send. However, in fulfilment of my promise, I am bound to go on giving quotation after quotation, bringing home to you your own former political teachings, and I hope I shall be able clearly to prove that you once believed in all the principles upon which the different Resolutions of the National Congress are based.</description>

LETTER THREE
Well may we apply the opening sentence of Dickens&#39; Tale of Two Cities to the present times in India. Well may we say that it is &amp;ldquo;the best of times&amp;rdquo; as well as &amp;ldquo;the worst of times.&amp;rdquo; Best as the country is on the point of having a nation, worst as a particular section of the community wants to check the progress of the country; and unfortunately is headed, or at least is said to be headed, by a man who has been a frequent advocate of representative Government in India.</description>

LETTER FOUR
The fourth meeting of the Indian National Congress is soon to be held at Allahabad, and so I think I must hasten to give some more of the most important quotations in this letter of mine. The less important ones I leave for some future occasion.
When this letter reaches you, you will be, possibly, smiling over [Lord Dufferin] the ex-Viceroy&amp;rsquo;s [anti-Congress] speech delivered at the St.</description>

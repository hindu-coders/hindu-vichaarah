      <description>The Gaol At Dongri, Bombay &amp;ldquo;You are sentenced to fifty years&amp;rsquo; transportation. The International Tribunal at Hague has given judgement that England cannot be constrained to hand you over to France&amp;rdquo;, said Mr. X to me.
&amp;ldquo;Well then, I had never depended on any hopes from that quarter. But can I have a copy of the judgement to look at?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;That does not rest with me, though I will try my very best for you.</description>

      <description>While climbing up to my cell in the Byculla prison I felt that I had to go one step higher in solitariness and dejection. For the cell here was more gloomy and far lonelier than the one I had occupied at Dongri. At Dongri I had no other person near about me, but the noise of the outer world fell upon my ears. I had, besides, a book or two to read, and some sundry articles about me.</description>

      <description>At Thana It seemed to be all bustle and noise in the prison at Thana. Every one was, as it were, on the tiptoe of expectation. A prisoner sentenced to fifty years&amp;rsquo; transportation to the Andamans, a bar-at- law was arriving! The Officers in charge had issued the strictest orders that none was to look at me even with an eye askance. A part of the prison was purged clean of its prisoners and warders.</description>

      <description>On The Way The portion of the prison-house reserved for the chalan&amp;rsquo;s confinement in the gaol at Thana, was to me like crossing the threshold and entering the precincts ofthe Andamans. The room in which I was locked up in that outlying part of the gaol, though a solitary cell, was within hearing of the rooms occupied by the prisoners in die Chalan. I could hear from my room the noise they created, the sighs they heaved, their wails, their talks and their good cheer, clearly enough to divert me from the long loneliness of my own cell.</description>

      <description>The Cult of the Bomb The first batch of political prisoners sent to the Andamans consisted of Bengalis involved in the Manik Tola Bomb Case, and two gentlemen from Maharashtra, namely Mr. Ganesh Savarkar and Mr. Wamanrao Joshi. Soon after them came another batch of six persons from Bengal implicated in the trial for political dacoity. Of all these, three from Bengal and two from Maharashtra happened to be sentenced to transportation for life.</description>

      <description>The Black Sea They took me on the ladder and put me in the ground-floor of that steamer. A portion with strong iron bars was set apart in that place, no better than a long and narrow cage to accommodate twenty or thirty of us, in which were to be huddled prisoners on transportation at least fifty in number. We were no better there than cattle huddled up on board the steamer.</description>

      <description>The Andamans The group of islands, including the Andamans and the Nicobars, constitute a link not only with the past history of India but also with her development in the world of tomorrow. As such no Indian can afford to be ignorant about this group of islands. India of today is bound to have cultural contacts with other parts of the world; and the Andamans are a part of it that she is bound to influence.</description>

      <description>We reach Andamans Our steamer had entered the port of the Andamans and her anchor was cast with ringing chain into its waters. She had stopped, and boats and officers&amp;rsquo; launches were seen gathering around her to remove the prisoners. We had to wait for a long time before we were let down into the boats. I cast a glance around me to survey the place where I was to pass the rest of my life.</description>

      <description>The First Week in my cell The Jamadar led me to Chawl No. 7. On the way lay a big reservoir of water. The Jamadar asked me to take my bath there. I had not taken my bath for four or five days. My body was full of sweat and dirt. The sea-voyage had done it. I was delighted with the permission to bathe. But I had no garment to change.</description>

      <description>I see my elder brother Myself and my elder brother were in the same jail, and we had not seen each other yet. His heart received a shock to know that I was here. And the news ofhis sufferings had wrung my heart. But a day came to prove unto me that these happenings in the past were almost nothing in our experience of life. Joy is scarcely fraught with such pain as that day brought to us both.</description>

      <description>I am put on the Oil-Mill For nearly a month after my entry into the Silver Jail, I did the work of picking oakum. Everyone was wondering how I was not put on the oil-mill. The optimist said, &amp;ldquo;Now, how can they put &amp;lsquo;a barrister-babu&amp;rsquo; like me on the oil-mill?&amp;rdquo; I said to him, &amp;ldquo;They will put me on it with the same mouth that they pronounced the sentence of transportation for life on me!</description>

      <description>Consolidation and Propaganda in the Andamans While I worked on the &amp;lsquo;Kolu’ I had an opportunity of knowing much, not only of the condition of the political prisoners inside the jail, but also of the situation in the Andamans as a whole. In spite of a thousand obstacles in their way, those who had learnt to love and admire me put themselves into contact with me and gave me news about the islands.</description>

      <description>Correspondence with India and means of information A prisoner in the Andamans was permitted to write only one letter home during the year. The letter had, perforce, to be as brief as possible. Again, it was to be an open letter, to be censored first by the jailor, next by the Colonial Officer, and to be despatched if approved by them. Every prisoner was warned that the letter shall not be forwarded if it breathed a single word against the jail authorities.</description>

      <description>The Coronation Ceremony of 1911 and its shadow on the prison in the Andamans As narrated in the previous chapter, the publication of Mr. Hotilal&amp;rsquo;s letter by The Bengali created a flutter in the official dovecotes. In the wake of that stir and excitement was created an atmosphere of sudden hope in the prison at Andamans. A thick rumour was abroad that all political prisoners, including myself, would be released in a month or two after the Coronation Durbar at Delhi to follow the King-Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Coronation in London.</description>

      <description>The prisoner&amp;rsquo;s food in the Andamans While these changes were going on in India between the end of 1911 and the beginning of 1912, I had nearly finished my one year of imprisonment in the island of the Andamans. In spite of bad food and inhuman treatment in that prison, I had managed to keep normal health, on the whole, during the period. I may, therefore, give here a general idea of the kind of food we were served in this prison.</description>

      <description>Suicide, Mental derangement, arrests, the second and the third strike In the first six months of my sentence in the Andamans, I was treated as a prisoner in solitary confinement. As a matter of fact almost all other prisoners were sent outside the prison for their work after they had finished their term of six months of simple or hard labour in the prison itself But at the time that they were taken out.</description>

      <description>“Memories of those momentous years and trying days rise in a flood and struggling to find a vent keep knocking at the gates of our heart. How we wish we could have spoken of them all and recited our reminiscences, but our lips must be sealed. How we long to write of it all
Thus wrote Veer V.D. Savarkar contributing a tribute to V.V.S. Aiyer after his sudden and sad demise to Maratha in 1925.</description>

      <description>“Oh hush thee my baby the time soon will come When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may For strife comes with manhood and waking with day”.
 Scott.  Shrijut Damodarpant Savarkar, the father of the distinguished patriot whose life we mean to sketch here was a cultured gentleman, belonging to the chitpavan section of the Maratha Brahmins.</description>

      <description>“The Hero is not fed on sweets Daily his own heart he eats”
-Emerson
In 1901 Vinayak passed his entrance examination In spite of his political preoccupations he never neglected his studies nor allowed his comrades to do that. So throughout his educational career he never failed. A large party arranged by the society and attended by several leading men of the city gave him a hearty send off on the eve of his leaving Nashik for Poona.</description>

      <description>“Resistance to aggression is not only justifiable but imperative. Non-resistance hurts both egoism and altruism”.
 Herbert Spencer  Even while on board the ship Mr. Savarkar lay not idle though for a man of his tender heart and loving and lovable nature homesickness was bound to weigh heavily on his mind yet in spite of the dear memory of devoted friends and favourites and relations that made him pine and often moved him to tears he immediately opened his patriotic campaign amongst the few Indian students who sailed by the same steamer.</description>

      <description>“When he who adores thee has left But the name of his faults and sorrows behind. Oh say! Wilt thou weep when they darken The fame of a life that for thee was resigned!!”
While the indomitable activities of the Abhinava Bharat became so serious as to be a cause of anxiety to the Scotland Yard which had to extend its scope to France and Germany, to cope with the Indian revolutionist propaganda, India too, lay not idle.</description>

      <description>“Behold! We enter this sacrificial fire today The first instalment of our debt of love we pay!
 Savarkar.  The excessive strain that was taxing the physical capacity of Mr. Savarkar at last broke down his health. He was attacked by high fever which developed into acute bronchitis. His developed friends and followers nursed him more tenderly than a mother would do and ultimately on medical advice removed him to sanatorium under the charge of an efficient Indian Doctor in Wells.</description>

      <description>The day when Mr. Savarkar was to be extradited and sail for India to the intense grief and anxiety of his friends and comrades in arms, he received most touching letters from several Indians as well as European gentlemen. In response he wrote the following letter and managed through a private source to send it out to France from his prison on the eve of his extradition in 1910.
 “Whose heart to by silken ties is knit of friendship sweet, that sweeter grows by far partaking of the Godly sacrament of mother&amp;rsquo;s creed Divine: Oh friends!</description>

      <description>“Oh blest are the bravest friends Who shall live the day of glory to see! But next dearest blessing that heaven can give Is the pride of thus dying for thee.
 Thomas Moore  At last Mr. Savarkar landed back on those native shores for which “he longed and he pined”—but in a very different way. As soon as steamer reached Bombay he was escorted down through rows of drawn swords and cuffed.</description>

      <description>Just to let in a ray or two more into the secret chambers of the activities of Abhinava Bharat which must long remain dark and sealed to the outside public for the simple reason, that their disclosure cannot be made by the actors who took part in them under the present political conditions in India, we take the liberty of reproducing two reminiscences as related by two distinguished men who wrote them from personal knowledge.</description>

      <description>The second reminiscence comes from the fascinating pen of Mr. Asaf Ali, Bar-at-law, and will enable the reader to see Mr. Savarkar as seen by others in London who were more or less in the know.
“Darkness and light divide the course of time, and oblivion shares with memory a great part even of our living beings: we slightly remember our felicities, and the smartest strokes of affliction leave but a short smart upon us.</description>

      <description>A few extracts from the Judgment of the Special Tribunal in the case of Mr. Savarkar which resulted in his conviction.
 “The case for the prosecution is that we have here to deal with certain members of a revolutionary conspiracy existing in Nashik, Bombay, Pen, Poona, Yeola, Aurangabad and other places in the Deccan, the activities of which were directly by the energy of Vinayak Savarkar towards political assassination by means of pistols and explosives.</description>

      <description>A libellous publication against the Savarkar brothers and how the Capital had to tender an object apology to them for having published the same.
Which the Savarkar brothers well still rotting in the jail and all public efforts to get them released were doggedly being set at naughty by the then authorities, the Capital, a leading Anglo-Indian Journal of Calcutta, came forward to break a lance or two in defence of the authorities.</description>

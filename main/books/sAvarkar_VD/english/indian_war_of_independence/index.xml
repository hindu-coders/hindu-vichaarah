      <description>The battle of freedom once begun
And handed down from sire to son
Though often lost is ever won!!
To-day is the tenth of May!
It was on this day, that in the ever memorable year of 1857, the first campaign of the War of Independence was opened by you, Oh Martyrs, on the battle-field of India. The Motherland, awakened to the sense of her degrading slavery, Unsheathed her sword, burst forth from the shackles and struck the first blow for her liberty and for her honour.</description>

      <description>Most historians, British as well as Indian, have described and dismissed the rising of 1857 as a ‘Sepoy Munity’ or at best ‘The Indian Mutiny’. Indian revolution is on the other hand, and national minded leaders thinkers have regarded it as a planned and organised olitical and military rising aimed at destroying the British power in India. Mr. Sawarkar’s is an attempt to look at the incidents of 1857 from the Indian point of view.</description>

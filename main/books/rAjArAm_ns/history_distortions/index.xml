      <description>CHAPTER II
Distortions in Indian History
Introduction: roots of distortion
India gained independence from the British in 1947, or more than fifty years ago. But intellectually and educationally India continues be a European colony. This is because, during the first forty years of her existence as a free nation, the Congress Party and the intellectual establishment, continued to encourage colonial institutions and thinking. The result today is that there is an English educated elite that identifies itself more with the West than with India and her ancient civilization.</description>

      <description>Preface
The first half century of India’s existence as a free nation is characterized by two significant failures: first, a failure to define the concept of India as a nation; second, a failure to evolve national institutions in education and intellectual life. In other words, a comprehensive failure to define a vision of nationalism rooted in the country’s history and culture. The result is that anti-national forces have had a field day, seriously undermining national security.</description>

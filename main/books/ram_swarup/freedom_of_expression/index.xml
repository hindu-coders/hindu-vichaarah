      <description>Preface
The concept of Secularism as known to the modern West is dreaded, derided and denounced in the strongest terms by the foundational doctrines of Christianity and Islam. Both of these doctrines prescribe Theocracy under which the State serves as the secular arm of the Church or the Ummah, and society is regimented by the Sacred Canon or the Shariat.
This fact is more than evident if we survey the history of Christianity till the French Revolution, and the practice which prevails in all Islamic states till today.</description>

Islam Imposes an Emergency on India1
Sita Ram Goel
No newspaper or periodical worth its name in India will publish what I write in the lines that follow. Not because the subject matter is seditious or sacrilegious or obscene, or even controversial, but simply because it defies the Emergency imposed on this country by Muslim theologians and politicians backed by &amp;lsquo;secularist&amp;rsquo; intellectuals and politicians and riotous Muslim mobs and plain terrorists.</description>

Fomenting Reaction1
Arun Shourie
Ram Swarup, now in his seventies, is a scholar of the first rank. In the 1950s when our intellectuals were singing paeans to Marxism, and to Mao in particular, he wrote critiques of communism and of the actual - that is, dismal performance of communist governments. He showed that the &amp;ldquo;sacrifices&amp;rdquo; which the people were being compelled to make had nothing to do with building a new society in which at some future date they would be the heirs to milk and honey.</description>

Mr. Mushirul Hasan&amp;rsquo;s innocous opposition to the ban on The Satanic Verses has stirred a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest. He attempted an apology but could not save himself from the hounds. On May 22, the fire-eating Imam of Jama Masjid declared from the pulpit that &amp;ldquo;anyone who defends Salman Rushdie is defiling Islam.&amp;rdquo; The students of the Jamia Millia shouted: &amp;ldquo;Qaum ka gaddar, Maut ka haqdar&amp;rdquo; (Betrayer of the community, deserver of death).</description>

Late in the afternoon on November 15, a police official visited the office of the Voice of India, a publication house that has been publishing works of academic excellence. These have one distinguishing feature: There is no other set of books which has done as thorough a job of nailing the falsehoods and evasions of the secularists as the books published by this small publishing house.</description>

Ban this Book1
Koenraad Elst
In a letter dated August 20, 1993, Janata Dal MP Syed Shahabuddin has asked the Minister of State for Home, P.M. Sayeed, to ban the book Hindu View of Christianity and Islam by Ram Swarup (Voice of India, New Delhi 1992). It is not his first time: in 1988, Shahabuddin was instrumental in getting Salman Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s The Satanic Verses banned. This time he has not been equally successful in getting the book swiftly banned, but judicial proceedings are under way to get it banned after all.</description>

G.A. Wells
Why I Am Not a Muslim, By Ibn Warraq (Amherst, N.Y. : Prometheus Books, 1995) 402 pp., $25.95 cloth.
Why I Am Not a Muslim certainly deserves the epithet &amp;ldquo;courageous&amp;rdquo; with which R. J. Hoffmann introduces it in his Foreword, not so much because of its thesis that Islamic civilization often reached magnificent heights despite the religion of Islam, as because almost all the fundamental tenets of Islam are here scrutinized uncompromisingly.</description>

It is the voice of those who are born Muslims but wish to recant in adulthood, yet are not permitted to on pain of death.</description>

Buckle up your seat belts as Warraq takes us for a nerve-wracking ride through the seamy and sordid parts of Islam. With his book as travel guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the dark and treacherous sides of Islam.
Warraq has the credentials because he&amp;rsquo;s taken the journey himself - one that started with the certainties of growing up in a Muslim family, then through the dark night of doubt and, finally, to rejecting completely all revealed religion.</description>

Was Mohammed a liar?
Hans Jansen1
The tradition teaches that Jesus and his family were from Nazareth but that he was born in Bethlehem. Why again was it that he was born in Bethlehem? Because of Roman Emperor Augustus&#39; order to organize a census. The Bible narrates how this census took place when one Quirinius was Roman Governor of Greater Syria. For this census, we are told, Jesus&#39; parents had to go to Bethlehem, and there his birth took place.</description>

Overview
&amp;ldquo;The ability to listen to a story,&amp;rdquo; said the renowned Telugu litterateure Rachakonda Vishwanatha Shastri, &amp;ldquo;is as important as the genius for writing one.&amp;rdquo; Similarly, if writing a book is one dimension of the effort, publishing is another. These days, it often takes courage to publish a controversial book. In the wake of the persecution of Salman Rushdie and the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, many publishers have become reluctant to bring out controversial books.</description>

Demystifying Islam1
Curt van den Heuvel
Why I am not a Muslim is a rare book. It is not often that one comes across Muslim apostates who are willing to openly share their views of Islam. As such, Warraq does an excellent job of demystifying Islam, and revealing it&amp;rsquo;s very human origins.
Through several chapters devoted to Muhammed and the Koran, Warraq traces the development of Islamic thought in Arabia.</description>

Taslima Nasreen
In the wake of the Rushdie Affair, a report in The New York Times (February 27, 1989) voiced a common fear: &amp;ldquo;Ayotollah Khomeini has probably succeeded in preventing publication in this country of books critical of Muslims and Islam.&amp;rdquo; This prophecy has proved, fortunately wrong, witness the writings of Anwar Shaikh that have earned him a fatwa from the mullahs in Pakistan, or Dr.</description>

The Koranic View of Government1
Anwar Shaikh
The book Why I am Not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq is a nice aggregate of learning, intellect and courage. I was delighted when its author paid me a visit in the early part of 1997. During the conversation, I was impressed by his motive and mastery of the subject.
Ibn Warraq is the pen-name of the author whose parents emigrated from India to Pakistan as a result of the Partition.</description>

Islam is religious fascism1
Ibn Al-Rawandi
Why I am not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq
(Prometheus Books, £ 15 to RPA members).
In one of his early works the traditionalist writer Frithjof Schuon makes an acute observation about the mentality of Muslims: &amp;ldquo;The intellectual - and thereby the rational - foundation of Islam results in the average Muslim having a curious tendency to believe that non-Muslims either know that Islam is the truth and reject it out of pure obstinacy, or else are simply ignorant of it and can be converted by elementary explanations; that anyone should be able to oppose Islam with a good conscience quite exceeds the Muslim&amp;rsquo;s power of imagination, precisely because Islam coincides in his mind with the irresistible logic of things.</description>

Far more dangerous than Nazism1
Dr. Jan Knappert
Ibn Warraq: Why I am not a Muslim. Prometheus Books, New York 1995, xvi, 402 pages, ISBN. 0-87975-984-4.
Ibn Warraq grew up in a Muslim family. Islam is a jealous religion so that any man who grew up in a Muslim family and is, for that reason considered a Muslim, not by his own volition, has to remain a Muslim for life, or else he is sentenced to death, and this sentence will be carried out as soon as a Muslim assassin can get him in the crossed hairs.</description>

      <description>Foreword
The Reawakening of Dharmic and Native Traditions
There are two major groups of religions in the world today. First are the conversion-based religions of Christianity and Islam. Each holds that it is the only true faith for humanity and solely represents God&amp;rsquo;s plan and God&amp;rsquo;s will. Both reflect an exclusivist ethos of One God, a single holy book, a final prophet or single savior, an historical revelation, salvation from sin, and heaven or hell as the ultimate resting-place for the soul.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1
Sanatana Dharma: Anusmriti and Anudhyâyana
Repeated and Cherished Recollection
and Meditation on Sanatana Dharma
1. I take refuge in the great Sanatana dharma, the mother of many religions.
Spiritual Teachings: Âtma and Anâtma
2. The ancient sages studied man and for that they started with themselves; they turned their gaze inward and found there a vast internal life. Going still deeper, they discovered, beyond their more external being, another life or principle which takes another language to describe it; they found it self-existent, bodiless, pure, luminous and conscious; they found that it is in some way unborn and undying; that it does not come along with the body nor does it die with it; that it is beyond sorrow and decay; that it shines from within and it knows itself as self-evident.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2
Cultural Self-Alienation Among the Hindus1
When two cultures meet on unequal military terms - as the Hindu culture met the West and earlier met Islam - it gives rise to grave problems of self-identity for the defeated party. When India finally realized that she had lost in the military and diplomatic contest and that the British were supreme, she was overwhelmed and filled with a deep sense of inferiority.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
Buddhism vis-a-vis Hinduism1
Buddhism is returning home to India after a long exile of a thousand years and, like the proverbial prodigal son, is being received with open arms. Religious tolerance of the average Hindu partly explains the warm reception. But a very important reason is the fact that Buddha and Buddhism form an intimate part of Hindu consciousness. Buddha was a Hindu. Buddhism is Hindu in its origin and development, in its art and architecture, iconography, language, beliefs, psychology, names, nomenclature, religious vows and spiritual discipline.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4
Indo-European Encounter: An Indian Perspective
India and Europe1 originally came out in German in 1981. The English translation which was originally published by the State University of New York in 1988 has now been brought out in an Indian edition and made available to readers in India. The English translation is a much enlarged version of the original German edition and the Indian edition carries a special Preface by the author.</description>

      <description>Chapter 5
Development in Huxley&amp;rsquo;s Thought: Hindu-Buddhist Influences
Hinduism-Buddhism has been making a great impact on the West&amp;rsquo;s religious thinking. C.E.M. Joad even called it a &amp;ldquo;counter-attack from the East&amp;rdquo;. This is a kind of impact however which cannot be measured in terms of &amp;ldquo;converts&amp;rdquo;. The influence remains even unacknowledged. But it works nonetheless unconsciously and at a deeper level. &amp;ldquo;Karma&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yoga&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Consciousness&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Meditation&amp;rdquo; and other such intimately Indian concepts are very much current.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6
The Hindu View of Education
A nation&amp;rsquo;s theories about education depend upon its theories about man. Its definition and understanding of education depend upon its definition and understanding of man.
If we regard man as a physical entity, our approach to education would be of one kind; if we regard man as a mental being, our approach would be of a different kind. But if we regard man as a spiritual being, our educational formulations are bound to be different.</description>

      <description>Chapter 7
Educational System During Pre-British Days
Ancient India was celebrated for its learning all over civilized Asia and Europe. Megasthenese (ca. 302 BC) was struck by the depth of this learning during his mission to the court of Chandragupta. Fa-hien, the famous Chinese traveller (399413 AD) spent some years at the Pataliputra and Tamralipti monasteries. He also spent two years in Ceylon which too had its monasteries after the India fashion.</description>

      <description>Chapter 8
India and Greece
The movement of men and ideas from the West to the East is a recent phenomenon. There was a time when the movement was in the opposite direction and the East had gone to the West in a big way.
At that time, India&amp;rsquo;s cultural frontiers too were wider than her political frontiers and her ideas influenced lands and people far away from her physically. Vedic India shared many of her Gods with Iran and one of them, Mithra (Mitra), went on a long journey to the West.</description>

      <description>Preface
It was early in 1987 that Hinduism Today1 sent to me reprints of four articles that had been published in its issue of November/ December, 1986.2 Based on extensive research, the articles told the story of some Catholic missionaries establishing &amp;ldquo;ashrams&amp;rdquo; in different parts of India and doing many other things in order to look like Hindu sannyasins. They also pointed out some glaring contradictions between Hindu spiritual perceptions on the one hand and the basic Christian beliefs on the other.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 1
New Labels for Old Merchandise
The emergence of Catholic ashrams in several parts of the country is not an isolated development. These institutions are links in a chain which is known as the &amp;ldquo;Ashram Movement&amp;rdquo;, and which different denominations of Christianity are promoting in concert. The Protestants and the Syrian Orthodox have evolved similar establishments. Taken together, these institutions are known as Christian ashrams. Several books and many articles have already been devoted to the subject by noted Christian writers.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 2
Indigenisation: A Predatory Enterprise
The precedent cited most frequently by the literature of Indigenisation is that which was set by the Greek Fathers when they used Greek cultural forms for conveying Christianity to the pagans in the Roman Empire. Fr. Bede recommends this precedent to the mission in India. &amp;ldquo;The Church,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;has a perfect model of how it should proceed today in the way it proceeded in the early centuries.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 3
The Patron Saint of Indigenisation
&amp;ldquo;De Nobili, in fact,&amp;rdquo; observes Fr. Bede, &amp;ldquo;gives us the key to what was wrong in the Christian approach to the Hindu and shows how the gospel might have been presented to India in such a way as to attract its deepest minds and its most religious men.&amp;quot;1 He contrasts the way of De Nobili with that of St. Francis Xavier for whom &amp;ldquo;all Hindus, but especially Brahmins, were &amp;lsquo;devil-worshippers&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 4
Mission&amp;rsquo;s Volte-Face vis-a-vis Hindu Culture
The mission&amp;rsquo;s new-found love for Hindu culture is a sham. It is neither spontaneous nor sincere at any point. On the contrary, it remains forced, calculated and contrived throughout. Examined closely, it is no more than a thin veneer that cracks at the very first probe.
The language of Indigenisation indicates no change of heart on the mission&amp;rsquo;s part vis-a-vis Hindu culture. All that we learn, as we read between the lines, is that the mission is shifting its strategy in a changed situation.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 5
The Ashram Movement in the Mission
As in the case of the &amp;ldquo;pioneers of indigenous Christianity,&amp;rdquo; historians of the mission have been rummaging through the record in search of some Christian institutions of the past which can be presented now as &amp;ldquo;pioneers of the Ashram Movement&amp;rdquo;. The pride of place in this context goes, of course, to the &amp;ldquo;ashram&amp;rdquo; of Robert De Nobili and his successors at Madurai. We have already dealt with it in detail.</description>

The Trinity from Tannirpalli
The three names which have achieved celebrity in the Christian world, in India as well as abroad, are those of Jules Monchanin, Henri Le Saux and Bede Griffiths. All of them are associated with the Saccidananda Ashram at Tannirpalli in the Tiruchirapalli district of Tamil Nadu. The first two came from France and the third belongs to England. All three have become known as Indian sages.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 7
An Imperialist Hangover
The Christian mission equates the expansion of Christianity in different parts of the world with the march of the Holy Spirit. The history of Christianity helps us in understanding what the Holy Spirit really stands for-the march of European military machines, the forcible occupation of other people&amp;rsquo;s motherlands, the massacre of heathens or their conversion at the point of the sword, the exercise of political pressures by imperialist establishments, the use of money and manpower and the mass media on a large scale, and the perfection of a scholarship which excels in suppressio veri suggestio falsi (suppressing truth and spreading falsehood).</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 8
Catholic Ashrams
Adopting and Adapting Hindu Dharma
The Shantivanam Ashram looks like a rishi&amp;rsquo;s home transported from Vedic times to the banks of the sacred Cauvery River at a forested place near Trichy in South India. A pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s first impressions are strong, and very Hindu; the elaborately colourful Hindu shrine; the bearded, saffron-robed &amp;ldquo;swami&amp;rdquo; seated cross - legged on a straw mat; devotees practising yogic meditations, even chanting Hindu scriptures.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 9
The J.R. Ewing Syndrome
Television and movies struggle mightily to be dramatic, humorous, tragic, colorful, sexy and outrageous. Video is modern man&amp;rsquo;s moving canvas; like a painting, it can mimic but never match the real thing - life.
But perhaps it can help us interpret experience, find useful analogies, study the human condition. In fact, it did just that last night. As we pondered the front page story, seeking ways to explain the Hindu&amp;rsquo;s profound concerns to the global Catholic community, our analogy appeared on the screen.</description>

Interview with Father Bruno Barnhardt
Emmaculate Heart Hermitage
Father Barnhardt is a member of the same Catholic order-the Camaldolese Monks-as Father Bede Griffiths and has spent time at the Shantivanam Ashram. He shared some of his observations with Hinduism Today:
*Q. What is your observation on how Shantivanam has been successful as a means of conveying the Catholic message to the Indian people?
*A. For a long while for Catholicism to go into another country it would mean to bring some kind of European culture and implant it on top of the indigenous culture.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 11
Returning to the Hindu Fold
A Primer
What can a person do who finds himself a Catholic and wants to rejoin the Hindu faith of his ancestors? He need not wait until another incarnation, for his situation admits of a fairly simple solution-formal apostacy (&amp;ldquo;abandonment&amp;rdquo; from Catholicism, and readmission to the Hindu fold). Hindu religious leaders have always taken a liberal view of the return of converts to other faiths.</description>

Malaysia Hindus Protest Christian &amp;ldquo;Sadhu&amp;rdquo;1
On November 8th and 9th, about 1,000 Hindus gathered at the Methodist Church in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur to protest and confront the Pentecostal Christian, &amp;ldquo;Sadhu Chellapah,&amp;rdquo; who was making his third visit to Malaysia. An active propagator of the Christian faith in Malaysian estate and rural areas, he wears the orange robes (kavi) of Hindu monk and styles himself as a Sadhu (Hindu term for a wandering monk).</description>

Missionary&amp;rsquo;s Dirty Tricks1
R.K. Deshpande, president of Kalyan Ashram in Madhya Pradesh, India, submitted this news report translated from the Hindi newspaper Jansatta to Hinduism Today last month, as part of a campaign by the ashram to document and publicize the unethical conversion tactics practiced by many Christian missionaries.
In early 1982, Father Joseph Parekatil of the Catholic Church of Parasahi, Madhya Pradesh, destroyed the sacred murthi of the Goddess Visweshwari Siddheswari enshrined on the nearby Nawain Tekdi hill.</description>

The First Dialogue
Hinduism Today invited some interesting letters from its readers, Hindus as well as Christians. They are reproduced as below:
HINDUISM TODAY, APRIL-MAY 1987
Catholic Ashrams
The article on the above subject in your November-December issue exposes a fraud which Catholic missionaries have been practising upon unwary Hindus for a long time. An average Hindu does not know that the missionary clad in ochre robes is no sadhu, but a scheming impostor.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 13
The Second Dialogue
An article in praise of Fr. Bede Griffiths, published in the. Indian Express of Madras, provoked far more interesting exchanges, notably between Swami Devananda Saraswati and Fr. Bede Griffiths.
INDIAN EXPRESS, 18 MARCH 1987
An Apostle of Peace
(By R.R)
&amp;ldquo;Britain&amp;rsquo;s appropriate gift to India is Rev. Father Bede Griffiths, the sage of Saccidananda Ashram, Shanti Vanam, Tannirpalli. The Trinity Sat-Chit-Ananda, is a genuine experience of the Godhead.</description>

The Third Dialogue
This dialogue developed around a letter which K.V. Ramakrishna Rao wrote to the Indian Express in protest against Christian missionaries masquerading as Hindu sannyasins.
INDIAN EXPRESS, 13 FEBRUARY 1989
Crucifying the &amp;lsquo;Om&amp;rsquo;
Sir,-Nowadays, we find several Christian missionaries putting up ashrams at various places in India donning ochre robes, building temple-like churches, reciting Sanskrit slokas and practising other Hindu rites in the guise of &amp;lsquo;inculturation&amp;rsquo; - synthesis of Hinduism and Christianity.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 15
Bede Griffiths Drops the Mask
Hindus who are not conversant with the history and methods of the Christian mission, have been taken in by the soft language adopted by the mission strategists in recent years. Shri K. Swaminathan whose letters to the Indian Express have been reproduced in the previous chapter, is a typical example. It is, therefore, necessary to point out that soft language by itself means little if it does not spring from a sincere mind, and is not good-intentioned.</description>

Different Paths Meeting in God
This is an anthology1 of 12 articles contributed by distinguished theologians Catholic and Protestant, all belonging to prestigious divinity schools and universities. Some authors speak more philosophically, others more sociologically, but the book has a kind of unity which comes from a shared outlook. The authors also met at the Claremont Graduate school, California, where their first drafts were subjected to mutual criticism, thus ensuring further unity in the final product.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Liberal&amp;rdquo; Christianity1
Whether Christianity improves the general morals of its followers is doubtful, but it is certain that it does not widen their intellectual sympathies and does not open their hearts to the larger spiritual wealth of different peoples and cultures. This is also true of Islam, another revealed religion, but in the present discussion we shall restrict ourselves to Christianity alone.
From its early days, Christianity has claimed a monopoly of things divine.</description>

The Great Command and a Cosmic Auditing1
The volume surveys 788 most important evangelizing Plans produced by Christianity during its career of over 19 hundred years. All these Plans relate to the Great Commission - the command that Jehovah gave through the mouth of His only Begotten Son, Jesus, to the believers to &amp;ldquo;go and make disciples of all nations&amp;rdquo; (Mt. 28.19, 20). If there was also a command to improve their morals, it was neglected, but the one to preach and recruit more followers for their God was rather taken in earnest.</description>

Thy Kingdom is the Third World1
Tempted by Satan to number Israel, King David ordered a census of his people. This angered Jehovah and He offered him three alternatives to choose from : either three years of famine, or three months of destruction at the hand of his enemies, or the three days of the Lord. Counting on the great mercies of Jehovah, David chose to fall into His hand rather than into the hand of man.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX IV
Christianity Mainly for Export
God&amp;rsquo;s Legionaries
&amp;ldquo;Go into the world and preach the gospel to all creatures. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned&amp;rdquo; (Mk. 16.15-16), Jesus told his followers after he had died and risen from the dead. Christian scholars now know this biblical passage to be an interpolation but this fact has in no way cooled off their zeal for proselytizing.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX V
Proselytisation as it is Practised1
I did not realise I was stirring a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest in reviewing the Mission Handbook (March 13, 14). It invoked many rejoinders, most of them harsh. It helps inter-faith dialogue which the church has recently invited.
Many points have been made but, quite understandably I can only deal with a few more salient ones, and that too briefly. Mr Kuruvilla Chandy presents a justification for Christian proselytizing which is novel in its being so openly avowed.</description>

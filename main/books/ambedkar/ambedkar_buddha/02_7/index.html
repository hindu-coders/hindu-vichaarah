<p>Book Two, Part VIIâ€”Conversion of Women</p>
<p>1. *<a href="02_7.html#01">Conversion of Mahaprajapati Gautami, Yeshodhara, and her
Companions</a>* &ndash; 2. *<a href="02_7.html#02">Conversion of Prakrati, a
Chandalika</a>*</p>
<p>1 Conversion of Mahaprajapati Gautami, Yeshodhara, and her Companions</p>
<ol>
<li>When the Blessed One had been on a visit to his father&rsquo;s home,
the desire to join the Sangh was as keen among the Sakya women as it
was among the Sakya men.</li>
<li>The leader of such women was no other than Mahaprajapati
Gautami.</li>
<li>Now at the time when the Blessed One was staying among the
Sakyas in the Nigrodharama, Mahaprajapati Gautami went to him and
said, &ldquo;It would be well, Lord, if women were allowed to become
Parivrajakas and enter the Sangh under the doctrine and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Enough, O Gautami! Let not such a thought come into your
mind.&rdquo; And a second and a third time did Mahaprajapati make the same
request in the same words, and a second and a third time did she
receive the same reply.</li>
<li>Then Mahaprajapati Gautami, sad and sorrowful, bowed down
before the Blessed One, and went away weeping and in tears.</li>
<li>After the Blessed One had left Nigrodharama for his wanderings,
Mahaprajapati and the Sakya women sat together to give further
consideration to their request for admission to the Sangh, and the
refusal of the Lord to grant such a request.</li>
<li>The Sakya women refused to take the Lord&rsquo;s refusal as final.
They decided to go further: to assume the garb of a Parivrajaka and
present the Lord with a <em>fait accompli</em>.</li>
<li>Accordingly Mahaprajapati Gautami cut off her hair and put on
orange-coloured robes, and set out with a number of women of the Sakya
clan on her journey to meet the Lord, who was at that time staying in
Vesali in the Mahavana in the Kutagara Hall.</li>
<li>In due course Mahaprajapati Gautami with her companions arrived
at Vesali, and with swollen feet and covered with dust, came to the
Kutogara Hall.</li>
<li>Again she made the same request to the Blessed Lord which she
had made when he was staying at Nigrodharama, and he refused it
again.</li>
<li>On receiving his refusal a second time, Mahaprajapati
withdrew, and was standing outside the entrance of the hall not
knowing what to do. While she was so standing, Ananda, on his way to
the hall saw her and recognised her.</li>
<li>He then asked Mahaprajapati, &ldquo;Why standest thou there, outside
the porch, with swollen feet, covered with dust, and sorrowful,
weeping and in tears?&rdquo; &ldquo;Inasmuch, O Ananda, as the Lord, the Blessed
One, does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter the
homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
Tathagata,&rdquo; said Mahaprajapati.</li>
<li>Then did the Venerable Ananda go up to the place where the
Blessed One was, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and take
[=took] his seat on one side. And, so sitting, the Venerable Ananda
said to the Blessed One, &ldquo;Behold, Lord; Mahaprajapati Gautami is
standing outside under the entrance porch, with swollen feet, covered
with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in tears, inasmuch as the
Blessed One does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter
the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
Blessed One. It were well, Lord, if women were to have permission
granted to them to do as she desires.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Has not Mahaprajapati proved herself of great service to the
Blessed One, when as aunt and nurse she nourished him and gave him
milk, and on the death of his mother suckled the Blessed One at her
own breast; it were, therefore, well, Lord, that women should have
permission to go forth from the household life and enter the homeless
state, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
Tathagata.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Enough, Ananda! Let it not [be?], please, that women should
be allowed to do so.&rdquo; A second time and a third time did Ananda make
the same request, in the same words, and received the same reply.</li>
<li>Then the Venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One, &ldquo;What can be
the ground, Lord, for your refusal to allow women to take Parivraja?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Lord knows that the Brahmins hold that the Shudras and
women cannot reach moksha (Salvation) because they are unclean and
inferior. They do therefore not allow Shudras and women to take
Parivraja. Does the Blessed One hold the same view as the Brahmins?</li>
<li>Has not the Blessed One allowed the Shudras to take Parivraja
and join the Sangh in the same way he has done to the Brahmins? What
is the ground, Lord, for treating women differently?</li>
<li>Does the Blessed One hold that women are not capable of
reaching Nibbana, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the
Blessed One?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One replied, &ldquo;Ananda! Do not misunderstand me. I
hold that women are as much capable as men in the matter of reaching
Nibbana. Ananda! do not misunderstand me, I am not an upholder of the
doctrine of sex inequality. My rejection of Mahaprajapati&rsquo;s request is
not based on sex inequality. It is based on practical grounds.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am happy, Lord, to know the real reason. But must the Lord
refuse her request because of practical difficulties? Would not such
an act bring the Dhamma into discredit, and make it open to the charge
of upholding sex inequality? Could not the Lord devise some rules to
get over such practical difficulties by which the Lord is worried?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well, Ananda, I grant, if Mahaprajapati insists, that women
must be allowed to take Parivraja under the doctrine and discipline
proclaimed by me. But it shall be subject to eight conditions. Let
Mahaprajapati Gautami take upon herself the responsibility of
enforcing the Eight Chief Rules. That will be her initiation.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Venerable Ananda, when he learnt from the Blessed One
these Eight Chief Rules, went to Mahaprajapati Gautami and told her
all that the Blessed One had said.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just, Ananda, as a man or a woman, when young and of tender
years, accustomed to adorn himself, would, when he had bathed his
head, receive with both hands a garland of lotus flowers, or of
jasmine flowers, or of stimutaka flowers, and place it on the top of
his head; even so do I, Ananda, take upon me these Eight Chief Rules,
never to be transgressed during my lifelong [=lifetime],&rdquo; said
Mahaprajapati to Ananda.</li>
<li>Then the Venerable Ananda returned to the Blessed One, and
bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And so sitting,
the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One, &ldquo;Mahaprajapati Gautami,
Lord, has taken upon herself the responsibility for the enforcement of
the Eight Chief Rules; she may therefore be regarded as having
received the Upasampada initiation (entry into the Sangha).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now Mahaprajapati received ordination, and 500 Sakya ladies
who had come with her were also ordained at the same time. Thus
ordained, great Prajapati came before the Master, and saluting him,
stood on one side, and the Blessed One taught her the Dhamma, the
doctrine, and the discipline.</li>
<li>The other five hundred Bhikkhunis were ininstructed by
Nandaka, one of the disciples of the Blessed One.</li>
<li>Among the Sakya women who became Bhikkhunis along with
Mahaprajapati was Yeshodhara. After her initiation she came to be
known as Bhadda Kaccana.</li>

<p>§ 2. Conversion of Prakrati, a Chandalika</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the Blessed Lord was living in Shravasti, in the Jetavana
Arama of Anathpindika.</li>
<li>It so happened that Ananda, his disciple, had gone into the
city to beg for alms. After eating his food, Ananda was going to the
river for drinking water.</li>
<li>He saw a girl on the river bank filling her pot. Ananda asked
her to give him some water.</li>
<li>The girl, whose name was Prakrati, refused, saying she was a
Chandalika.</li>
<li>Ananda said, &ldquo;I am concerned with water, I am not concerned
with your caste.&rdquo; The girl then gave him some water from her pot.</li>
<li>Thereafter, Ananda left for Jetavana. The girl followed him and
saw where he was staying, and found that his name was Ananda and that
he was a follower of the Buddha.</li>
<li>On returning home she told her mother, Matangi, what had
happened; and falling on the ground, started weeping.</li>
<li>The mother asked for the cause of her weeping. The girl told
the whole story, and said, &ldquo;If you wish to marry me [=arrange my
marriage], I can only marry Ananda. I will not marry anybody else.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The mother started on an inquiry. On [her] return she told
the girl that such a marriage was impossible, for Ananda was under a
vow of celibacy.</li>
<li>On hearing this news, the girl was filled with extreme sorrow,
and gave up food. She was not prepared to take things as though it was
a decree of fate. So she said, &ldquo;Mother, you know the art of sorcery,
don&rsquo;t you? Why don&rsquo;t you employ it to achieve our purpose?&rdquo; The mother
said, &ldquo;I will see what can be done.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Matangi invited Ananda to her house for a meal. The girl
became very happy. Matangi then told Ananda that her daughter was very
anxious to marry him. Ananda replied, &ldquo;I am vowed to be celibate, and
therefore I cannot marry any woman.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you do not marry my daughter, she will commit suicide, so
attached she is to you,&rdquo; Matangi told Ananda. &ldquo;But I cannot help
[this],&rdquo; replied Ananda.</li>
<li>Matangi went inside, and told her daughter that Ananda refused
to marry her.</li>
<li>The girl cried, &ldquo;Mother, where is your sorcery?&rdquo; The mother
said, &ldquo;My sorcery cannot win against the Tathagata.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The girl shouted and said, &ldquo;Close the door, and do not allow
him to go out. I shall see that he becomes my husband this very
night.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The mother did what the girl wanted her to do. As night fell
the mother brought in[to] the room a bed. The girl, dressed in her
best, stepped in. But Ananda remained unmoved.</li>
<li>The mother at last used her sorcery. As a result, a fire broke
out in the room. The mother then held Ananda by his clothes and said,
&ldquo;If you will not agree to marry my daughter, I will throw you in this
fire.&rdquo; However, Ananda did not yield; and the mother and the daughter,
feeling helpless, left him free.</li>
<li>Ananda, on his return, told the Blessed Lord all that had
happened.</li>
<li>On the second day the girl came to Jetavana in search of
Ananda. Ananda was going out for alms. Ananda saw her and wanted to
avoid her. But the girl followed him wherever he went.</li>
<li>When Ananda returned to Jetavana, he found the girl waiting at
the door of his Vihar.</li>
<li>Ananda told the Blessed One how the girl was pursuing him. The
Blessed One sent for her.</li>
<li>When the girl appeared before him, the Blessed One asked her
why she was pursuing Ananda. The girl replied that she was intent on
marrying him. &ldquo;I have heard he is unmarried and I am also
unmarried.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Bhagavan said, &ldquo;Ananda is a Bhikku, and he has no hair on
his head. If you can get yourself clean shaven I shall see what could
be done.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The girl replied, &ldquo;I am prepared for it.&rdquo; The Bhagavan said,
&ldquo;You must get your mother&rsquo;s permission for undergoing tonsure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The girl returned to her mother and said, &ldquo;Mother! I have
achieved what you failed to achieve. The Bhagavan has promised to get
me married to Ananda if I undergo tonsure.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The mother grew angry and said, &ldquo;You must not do that. You are
my daughter, and you must keep hair. Why are you so eager to marry a
Shramana, Ananda? I can get you married to a better man.&rdquo;</li>
<li>She replied, &ldquo;I will either die, or marry Ananda. There is no
third alternative for me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Mother said, &ldquo;Why are you insulting me?&rdquo; The girl said,
&ldquo;If you love me you must let me do as I wish.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The mother withdrew her objection, and the girl underwent
tonsure.<br>
30.. Then the girl presented herself before the Blessed Lord,
saying, &quot; I have tonsured my head as directed by you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord then asked her, &ldquo;What do you want? What part
of his body you cherish?&rdquo; The girl said, &ldquo;I am in love with his nose,
I am in love with his mouth, I am in love with his ears, I am in love
with his voice, I am in love with his eyes, and I am in love with his
gait.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord then said to the girl, &ldquo;Do you know that the
eyes are the home of tears, the nose is the home of dirt, the mouth is
the home of spit, the ear is the home of dirt, and the body is the
container of dung and urine?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When men and women come together they procreate children. But
where there is birth there is death also; where there is death there
is sorrow also. My dear girl, what are you going to get by marrying
Ananda? I do not know.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The girl began to cogitate, and agreed that there was no
purpose in her marriage with Ananda, on which she was so intent; and
she told the Blessed Lord accordingly.</li>
<li>After saluting the Blessed Lord, the girl said, &ldquo;Owing to
ignorance, I was going in pursuit of Ananda. My mind is now
enlightened. I am like a sailor whose ship, after a mishap, has
reached the other bank. I am like an unprotected aged person who has
found protection. I am like the blind who has got new sight. The
Blessed Lord by his wise words of advice has awakened me from my
sleep.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Blessed art thou, Prakrati, for though you are a Chandalika
you will be a model for noblemen and noblewomen. You are of low caste,
but Brahmins will learn a lesson from you. Swerve not from the path of
justice and righteousness and you will outshine the royal glory of
queens on the throne.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The marriage having failed, the only course for her was to
join the Bhikkhuni Sangh.</li>
<li>Having expressed her wish she was admitted into it, though she
belonged to the lowest class.</li>

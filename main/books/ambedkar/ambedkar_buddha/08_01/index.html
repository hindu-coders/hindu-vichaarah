<p><strong>BOOK EIGHT:</strong> THE MAN WHO WAS SIDDHARTH GAUTAMA</p>
<p>Book Eight, Part Iâ€”His Personality</p>
<p>1. *<a href="08_01.html#01">His Personal Appearance</a>* &ndash; 2. *<a href="08_01.html#02">The
Testimony of Eye-witnesses</a>* &ndash; 3. *<a href="08_01.html#03">His Capacity to
Lead</a>*</p>
<p>§ 1. His Personal Appearance</p>
<ol>
<li>From all accounts the Blessed Lord was a handsome person.</li>
<li>His form was like the peak of a golden mountain. He was tall
and well built; with a pleasing appearance.</li>
<li>His long arms and lion gait, his bull-like eyes, and his beauty
bright like gold, his broad chest, attracted everyone to him.</li>
<li>His brows, his forehead, his mouth or his eyes, his body, his
hands, his feet, or his gait&ndash;whatever part of him anyone beheld, that
at once riveted his eyes.</li>
<li>Whoever saw him could not help being struck with his majesty
and his strength, his splendid beauty, surpassing all other men.</li>
<li>On seeing him, he who was going elsewhere stood still, and
whoever was standing followed him; he who was walking gently and
gravely ran quickly, and he who was sitting at once sprang up.</li>
<li>Of those who met him, some reverenced him with their hands;
others in worship saluted him with their heads; some addressed him
with affectionate words; not one went on without paying him homage.</li>
<li>He was loved and respected by all.</li>
<li>Men as well as women were ever ready to hear him.</li>
<li>His voice was singularly sweet and deep as a drum, lovely,
vibrant and eloquent. It made his speech as though it was heavenly
music.</li>
<li>His very tones convinced the hearer, and his looks inspired
awe.</li>
<li>His personality alone sufficed to make him not only a leader,
but a god, to the hearts of his fellows.</li>
<li>When he spoke he obtained hearers.</li>
<li>It mattered little what he said. He influenced the emotions,
and bent whoever listened to his will.</li>
<li>He could create in the minds of his hearers [the sense] that
what he taught was not only a verity, but the very hope of their
salvation.</li>
<li>His hearers could recognise in his words the truth that makes
of slaves, free men.</li>
<li>When he talked with men and women, his serene look inspired
them with awe and reverence, and his lovely voice struck them with
rapture and amazement.</li>
<li>Who could have converted the robber Augulimala, or the
Cannibal of Atavi? Who could have reconciled King Pasenjit to his
queen Mallika by a single word? To have come under his spell is
[=was] to be his forever. So charming was his personality.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Testimony of Eye-witnesses</p>
<ol>
<li>This traditional view is supported by the testimony of
eye-witnesses who saw him and met him while he was alive.</li>
<li>One such eye-witness is a Brahmin, by name Sale. After seeing
the Blessed One face to face, he uttered the following sentiments in
praise of him.</li>
<li>Arrived in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the Brahmin, seating himself
after greetings, scanned the Lord&rsquo;s body for the two and thirty marks
of a Superman, and in time observed them.</li>
<li>Quite sure now about the presence of the two and thirty marks,
Sale still did not know whether or not he had enlightenment. But he
remembered hearing from old and aged Brahmins, teachers of teachers,
that those who became Arahats, all enlightened, reveal themselves when
their praises are sung, and so he made up his mind to extol the Lord
to his face in the following lines of eulogy:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perfect of body, goodly, Lord, art thou, well grown, well
liking, golden-hued, with teeth which gleam [with] lustre; vigour
fills the frame; the body&rsquo;s full perfection manifests each single sign
that marks a Superman.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Clear-eyed and handsome, tall, upright art thou, effulgent as
a sun among thy train, so debonair, so golden-hued&ndash;why waste thy
beauty&rsquo;s prime as homeless anchorite?</li>
<li>&ldquo;As world-wide monarch thou shouldst ride in State; and indeed
from sea to sea[all] should own thy sway. Proud princes shall thy
village headmen be; rule thou mankind, as sovereign, king of kings!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Ananda describes the colour of his body as exceedingly clear
and bright&ndash;so much so that the pair of [garments of] cloth of gold,
when placed on the body of the Blessed One, appears to have lost its
splendour.</li>
<li>No wonder he was called by his opponents a glamour boy.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. His Capacity to Lead</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sangh had no official head. The Blessed One had no
authority over the Sangh. The Sangh was a self-governing body.</li>
<li>What was, however, the position of the Blessed One over the
Sangh and its members?</li>
<li>In this we have the evidence of Sakuldai and Udai,
contemporaries of the Blessed One.</li>
<li>Once the Lord was staying at Rajagraha in the bamboo grove.</li>
<li>One morning the Lord went into Rajagraha for alms; but, deeming
the hour too early, he thought of going to Sakuldai in Wanderers&rsquo;
Pleasance; and thither he repaired.</li>
<li>At the time, Sakuldai was sitting with a great company of
Wanderers, who were making a great noise about being and not being.</li>
<li>When from some way off, Sakuldai saw the Lord coming, he hushed
his company by saying: &ldquo;Be quiet, sirs; do not make a noise; here
comes the recluse Gautama, who is a lover of silence.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So they became silent and the Lord came up. Said Sakuldai, &ldquo;I
pray the Lord to join us; he is truly welcome; it is a long time since
he last managed to come. Pray, be seated; here is a seat for the
Lord.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord sat down accordingly, asking Sakuldai what had been
their theme and what was the discussion which had been interrupted.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let that pass for the moment,&rdquo; answered Sakuldai; &ldquo;you can
easily gather that later on.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Of late, when recluses and Brahmins of other creeds met
together in the Discussion Hall, the topic was mooted, what a good
thing, what a very good thing, for the Magdha people in Anga, that
such recluses and Brahmins&ndash;all at the head of confraternities or
followings, all well known and famous teachers, all founders of saving
creeds, held in high repute by many people&ndash;should have come to spend
the rainy season at Rajagraha.</li>
<li>There was Purana Kassappa, Makhali Ghosala, Ajit Kesakambal,
Pakudha Kacchayana, Sanjaya Belaiputta, and Nata-putta the Nigantha,
all men of distinction and all of them here for the rains; and among
them there is also the recluse Gautama here, at the head of his
confraternity and following, a well-known and famous teacher, a
founder of a saving creed, who is held in high repute by many.</li>
<li>Now, which of these lords, which of these recluses and
Brahmins of such eminence as teachers, is esteemed, respected,
venerated and adored by his disciples? And on what terms of esteem and
respect do they live with him?</li>
<li>Said some: &ldquo;Purana Kassappa gets no esteem or respect; no
veneration or adoration, from his disciples; they live with him on no
terms of esteem and respect.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Time was when, as he was preaching his doctrine to some
hundreds of his following, a disciple broke in with&ndash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question
Purana Kassappa, who does not know about it; ask me who do; I will
explain everything to your reverences.&rdquo;</li>
<li>With arms outstretched, Purana Kassappa tearfully
remonstrated, saying: &ldquo;Do be quiet, sirs, do not make a noise.&rdquo;<br>
[[SURELY THIS CAN&rsquo;T REALLY BE THE END?]]</li>

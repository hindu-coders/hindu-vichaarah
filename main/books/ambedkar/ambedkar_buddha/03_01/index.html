<p><strong>BOOK THREE:</strong> WHAT THE BUDDHA TAUGHT</p>
<p>Book Three, Part Iâ€”His Place in His Dhamma</p>
<p>1. *<a href="3_01.html#01">The Buddha claimed no place for Himself in His Own
Dhamma</a>* &ndash; 2. *<a href="3_01.html#02">The Buddha did not promise to give
salvation. He said He was <em>Marga Data</em> (Way Finder) and not <em>Moksha
Data</em> (Giver of Salvation)</a>* &ndash; 3. *<a href="3_01.html#03">The Buddha did
not claim any Divinity for Himself or for His Dhamma. It was
discovered by man for man. It was not a Revelation</a>*</p>
<p>§ 1. The Buddha claimed no place for Himself in His own Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>Christ claimed to be the Prophet of Christianity.</li>
<li>He further claimed that he was the Son of God.</li>
<li>Christ also laid down the condition that there was no salvation
for a person unless he accepted that Christ was the Son of God.</li>
<li>Thus Christ secured a place for Himself by making the salvation
of the Christian depend upon his acceptance of Christ as the Prophet
and Son of God.</li>
<li>Mohammad, the Prophet of Islam, claimed that he was a Prophet
sent by God.</li>
<li>He further claimed that no one could get salvation unless he
accepted two other conditions.</li>
<li>A seeker of salvation in Islam must accept that Mohammad is the
Prophet of God.</li>
<li>A seeker after salvation in Islam must further accept that he
is the last prophet.</li>
<li>Salvation in Islam is thus ensured only to those who accept
these two conditions.</li>
<li>Mohammad thus secured a place for Himself by making the
salvation of the Muslim depend upon his acknowledgement of Mohammed as
the Prophet of God.</li>
<li>No such condition was ever made by the Buddha.</li>
<li>He claimed that he was no more than the natural son of
Suddhodana and Mahamaya.</li>
<li>He carved for himself no place in his religion by laying down
any such conditions regarding himself for salvation as Jesus and
Mahommad did.</li>
<li>That is the reason why we are left to know so little about
himself even though abundant material was available.</li>
<li>As is known, the first Buddhist congregation was held soon
after the death of the Buddha at Rajagraha.</li>
<li>Kassyappa presided over the congregation. Anand, Upali and
many others who belonged to Kapilavatsu and who wandered with him
wherever he went, and were with him till his death, were present.</li>
<li>But what did Kassyappa the President do?</li>
<li>He asked Anand to repeat the Dhamma and put the question to
the congregation, &ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo; They answered in the affirmative.
And Kassyappa then closed the question.</li>
<li>Thereafter he asked Upali to repeat the Vinaya and put the
question to the congregation, &quot; Is this right ?&rdquo; They answered in the
affirmative. Kassyappa then closed the question.</li>
<li>Kassyappa then should have put the third question to someone
present in the congregation to record some important incidents in the
life of the Buddha.</li>
<li>But Kassyappa did not. These were the only two questions with
which he thought the Sangh was concerned.</li>
<li>If Kassyappa had collected the record of the Buddha&rsquo;s life we
would have had today a full-fledged biography of the Buddha.</li>
<li>Why did it not strike Kassyappa to collect the record about
the Buddha&rsquo;s life?</li>
<li>It could not be indifference. The only answer one can give is
that the Buddha had carved no niche for himself in his religion.</li>
<li>The Buddha and his religion were quite apart.</li>
<li>Another illustration of the Buddha keeping himself out of his
religion is to be found in his refusal to appoint a successor.</li>
<li>Twice or thrice the Buddha was requested by his followers to
appoint a successor.</li>
<li>Every time the Buddha refused.</li>
<li>His answer was, &ldquo;The Dhamma must be its own successor.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Principle must live by itself, and not by the authority of
man.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If principle needs the authority of man, it is no
principle.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If every time it becomes necessary to invoke the name of the
founder to enforce the authority of Dhamma, then it is no Dhamma.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Such was the view he took of his own position regarding his
Dhamma.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Buddha did not promise to give Salvation. He said He was
Marga Data (Way Finder) and not Moksha Data (Giver of Salvation)</p>
<ol>
<li>Most religions are described as revelations. But the Buddha&rsquo;s
religion is not a revelation.</li>
<li>A revealed religion is so called because it is a message of God
to His creatures to worship their maker (i.e., God) and to save their
souls.</li>
<li>Often the message is sent through a chosen individual who is
called a prophet, to whom the message is revealed and who reveals it
to the people. It is then called Religion.</li>
<li>The obligation of the prophet is to ensure salvation to the
faithful.</li>
<li>Salvation of the faithful means the saving of their souls from
being sent to hell, provided they obey God&rsquo;s commands and recognise
the prophet as his messenger.</li>
<li>The Buddha never claimed that he was a prophet or a messenger
of God. He repudiated any such description.</li>
<li>A more important point than this is that his religion is a
discovery. As such, it must be sharply distinguished from a religion
which is called Revelation.</li>
<li>His religion is a discovery in the sense that it is the result
of inquiry and investigation into the conditions of human life on
earth; and understanding of the working of human instincts with which
man is born; the moulding of his instincts and dispositions which man
has formed as a result of history and tradition, and which are working
to his detriment.</li>
<li>All prophets have promised salvation. The Buddha is the one
teacher who did not make any such promise. He made a sharp distinction
between a <em>moksha data</em> and a <em>marga data</em>, one who gives salvation
and one who only shows the way.</li>
<li>He was only a <em>marga data</em>. Salvation must be sought by each
for himself by his own effort.</li>
<li>He made this very clear to the Brahmin Moggallana in the
following Sutta.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Once the Exalted One was staying at Shravasti, in the East
Park, at the [multi-]storeyed house of Migara&rsquo;s mother.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then the Brahmin Moggallana, the accountant, came to the
Exalted One and gave him friendly greeting, and after the exchange of
courtesies sat down at one side. So seated, the Brahmin Moggallana,
the accountant, said this to the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as, Master Gautama, one gets a gradual view of this
[multi-]storeyed house, a progress, a graduated path, and so on
right up to the last step of the stairs, just so is the progressive
training of us Brahmins: that is to say, in our course of study in the
Vedas.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as in a course of archery, Gautama, with us the
Brahmins, the training, the progress, the approach is step by step;
for instance, in counting.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;When we take a private pupil we make him count thus: &lsquo;One
one, twice two, thrice three, four times four, and so on up to a
hundred.&rsquo; Now is it possible. Master Gautama, for you to point to a
similar progressive training on the part of your followers in your
Dhamma?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is so, Brahmin. Take the case, Brahmin, of a clever
horse-trainer. He takes a thoroughbred in hand, gives him his first
lesson with bit and bridle, and then proceeds to the further
course.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just so, Brahmin, the Tathagata takes in hand a man who is
to be trained and gives him his first lesson, thus: &lsquo;Come thou,
brother! Be virtuous. Abide, constrained by the restraint of the
obligation.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;Become versed in the practice of right behaviour; seeing
danger in trifling faults, do you undertake the training and be a
pupil in the moralities.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as he has mastered all that, the Tathagata gives him
his second lesson, thus: &lsquo;Come thou brother! Seeing an object with the
eye, be not charmed by its general appearance or its details.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Persist in the restraint of that dejection that comes from
craving, caused by the sense of sight uncontrolled&ndash;these ill states,
which would overwhelm one like a flood. Guard the sense of sight, win
control over the sense of sight.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so do with the other organs of sense. When you hear a
sound with the ear, or smell a scent with the nose, taste a taste with
the tongue, or with body touch things tangible, and when with mind you
are conscious of a thing, be not charmed with its general appearance
or its details.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as he has mastered all that, the Tathagata gives him
a further lesson, thus: &lsquo;Come thou, brother! Be moderate in eating;
earnest and heedful do you take your food, not for sport not for
indulgence, not for adding personal charm or comeliness to body, but
do it for body&rsquo;s stabilising, for its support, for protection from
harm, and for keeping up the practice of the righteous life, with this
thought: &lsquo;I check my former feeling. To no new feeling will I give
rise, that maintenance and comfort may be mine.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, Brahmin, when he has won restraint in food, the
Tathagata gives him a further lesson thus: &lsquo;Come thou, brother! Abide
given to watchfulness. By day, when walking or sitting, cleanse your
heart from things that may hinder you. By night spend the first watch
walking up and down or sitting, and do likewise. By night in the
second watch, lie down on the right side in the posture of a lion, and
placing one foot upon the other, mindful and self-possessed, set your
thoughts on the idea of exertion. Then in the third watch of the night
rise up, and walking up and down, or sitting, cleanse the heart of
things that may hinder.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, Brahmin, when the brother is devoted to watchfulness,
the Tathagata gives him a further lesson, thus: &lsquo;Come thou, brother!
Be possessed of mindfulness and self-control. In going forth or going
back, have yourself under control. In looking forward or looking back,
in bending or relaxing, in wearing robes or carrying robe and bowl, in
eating, chewing, tasting, in easing yourself, in going, standing,
sitting, lying, sleeping or waking, in speaking or keeping silence
have yourself under control.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then Brahmin, when he is possessed of self-control, the
Tathagata gives him a further lesson thus: &lsquo;Come thou, brother! Seek
out a secluded lodging, a forest or root of a tree, a mountain or a
cave or a mountain grotto, a charnel field, a forest retreat, the open
air, a heap of straw.&rsquo; And he does so. And when he has eaten his food
he sits down crosslegged, and keeping his body straight up, he
proceeds to practise the four ecstacies.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Brahmin, for all brothers who are pupils, who have not
yet attained mastery of mind, who abide aspiring, for such is the
manner of my training.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But as to those brethren who are arhants, who have destroyed
the asavas, who have lived the life, done their task, laid down the
burden, won their own salvation, utterly destroyed the fetters of
becoming, and are released by the perfect insight, for such as those
these things are conducive to ease in the present life and to mindful
self-control as well.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;When this was said, the Brahmin Moggallana, the accountant,
said to the Exalted One :</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But tell me, Master Gautama. Do the disciples of the worthy
Gautama,&ndash;do all of them win the absolute perfection which is Nibbana,
or do some fail thus to attain?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some of my disciples, Brahmin, thus advised and trained by
me, do so attain. Others do not.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But what is the reason, Master Gautama? What is the cause,
Master Gautama? Here we have Nibbana. Here we have the Path to
Nibbana. Here we have the worthy Gautama as instructor. What is the
reason, I say, why some disciples thus advised and trained do attain,
while others do not attain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That, Brahmin, is a question that I will answer. But first do
you answer me this, so far as you think fit. Now how say you.
Brahmin&ndash;Are you well skilled in the road to Rajagraha?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am, master, Skilled indeed am I in the road to
Rajagraha!&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Well, thus instructed, thus advised, he takes the wrong road,
and off he goes with his face set to the west.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then a second man comes up with the same request, and you
give him the same instructions. He follows your advice and comes safe
to Rajagraha.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is my business?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do I in the matter. Brahmin? The Tathagata is one who
only shows the way.&rsquo;</li>
<li>Here is a full statement that he does not promise salvation.
He only shows the way.</li>
<li>Besides, what is salvation?</li>
<li>With Mohammad and Jesus, salvation means saving the soul from
being sent to hell, by the intercession of the Prophet.</li>
<li>With Buddha, salvation means Nibbana, and Nibbana means
control of passions.</li>
<li>What promise of salvation can there be in such a Dhamma?</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. The Buddha did not Claim any Divinity for himself or for his
Dhamma. It was discovered by man for man. It was not a Revelation</p>
<ol>
<li>Every founder of religion has either claimed divinity for
himself or for his teachings.</li>
<li>Moses, although he did not claim for himself any divine origin,
did claim divine origin for his teachings. He told his followers that
if they wished to reach the land of milk and honey they must accept
the teachings, because they were the teachings of Jehovah the God.</li>
<li>Jesus claimed divinity for himself. He claimed that he was the
Son of God. Naturally His teachings acquired a divine origin.</li>
<li>Krishna said that he was God himself, and the <strong>Gita</strong> was his
own word.</li>
<li>The Buddha made no such claim, either for himself or his
Sasana.</li>
<li>He claimed that he was one of the many human beings and his
message to the people was the message of man to man.</li>
<li>He never claimed infallibility for his message.</li>
<li>The only claim he made was that his message was the only true
way to salvation as he understood it.</li>
<li>It was based on universal human experience of life in the
world.</li>
<li>He said that it was open to anyone to question it, test it,
and find what truth it contained.</li>
<li>No founder has so fully thrown open his religion to such a
challenge.</li>
</ol>

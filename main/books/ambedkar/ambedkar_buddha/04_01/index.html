From Religion</a>* &ndash; 3. *<a href="04_01.html#03">The Purpose of Religion and

Morality</a>* &ndash; 6. *<a href="04_01.html#06">Mere Morality is not Enough: it
must be Sacred and Universal</a>*</p>
<p>§ 1. What is Religion?</p>
<ol>
<li>The word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is an indefinite word with no fixed
meaning.</li>
<li>It is one word with many meanings.</li>
<li>This is because religion has passed through many stages. The
concept at each stage is called Religion, though the concept at one
stage has not had the same meaning which it had at the preceding
stage, or is likely to have at the succeeding stage.</li>
<li>The conception of religion was never fixed.</li>
<li>It has varied from time to time.</li>
<li>Because most of the phenomena such as lightning, rain, and
floods, the occurrence of which the primitive man could not explain,
[were not understood], any weird performance done to control the
phenomenon was called magic. Religion therefore came to be identified
with magic.</li>
<li>Then came the second stage in the evolution of religion. In
this stage religion came to be identified with beliefs, rituals,
ceremonies, prayers, and sacrifices.</li>
<li>But this conception of religion is derivative.</li>
<li>The pivotal point in religion starts with the belief that there
exists some power which causes these phenomena, which primitive man
did not know and could not understand. Magic lost its place at this
stage.</li>
<li>This power was originally malevolent. But later it was felt
that it could also be benevolent.</li>
<li>Beliefs, rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices were necessary both
to propitiate a benevolent power, and also to conciliate an angry
power.</li>
<li>Later that power was called God or the Creator.</li>
<li>Then came the third stage: that it is this God who created
this world and also man.</li>
<li>This was followed by the belief that man has a soul, and the
soul is eternal and is answerable to God for man&rsquo;s actions in the
world.</li>
<li>This is, in short, the evolution of the concept of Religion.</li>
<li>This is what Religion has come to be and this is what it
connotes&ndash;belief in God, belief in [a] soul, worship of God, curing
of the erring soul, propitiating God by prayers, ceremonies,
sacrifices, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. How Dhamma Differs From Religion</p>
<ol>
<li>What the Buddha calls Dhamma differs fundamentally from what is
called Religion.</li>
<li>What the Buddha calls Dhamma is analogous to what the European
theologians call Religion.</li>
<li>But there is no greater affinity between the two. On the other
hand, the differences between the two are very great.</li>
<li>On this account, some European theologians refuse to recognise
the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma as Religion.</li>
<li>There need be no regrets over this. The loss is theirs. It does
no harm to the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma. Rather, it shows what is wanting in
Religion.</li>
<li>Instead of entering into this controversy, it is better to
proceed to give an idea of Dhamma, and show how it differs from
Religion.</li>
<li>Religion, it is said, is personal, and one must keep it to
oneself. One must not let it play its part in public life.</li>
<li>Contrary to this, Dhamma is social. It is fundamentally and
essentially so.</li>
<li>Dhamma is righteousness, which means right relations between
man and man in all spheres of life.</li>
<li>From this it is evident that one man, if he is alone, does not
need Dhamma.</li>
<li>But when there are two men living in relation to each other,
they must find a place for Dhamma whether they like it or not. Neither
can escape it.</li>
<li>In other words. Society cannot do without Dhamma.</li>
<li>Society has to choose one of the three alternatives.</li>
<li>Society may choose not to have any Dhamma as an instrument of
Government. For Dhamma is nothing if it is not an instrument of
Government.</li>
<li>This means Society chooses the road to anarchy.</li>
<li>Secondly, Society may choose the police&ndash;i.e.,
dictatorship&ndash;as an instrument of Government.</li>
<li>Thirdly, Society may choose Dhamma, plus the Magistrate
wherever people fail to observe the Dhamma.</li>
<li>In anarchy and dictatorship liberty is lost.</li>
<li>Only in the third [case] liberty survives.</li>
<li>Those who want liberty must therefore have Dhamma.</li>
<li>Now what is Dhamma? and why is Dhamma necessary? According to
the Buddha, Dhamma consists of Prajna and Karuna.</li>
<li>What is Prajna? And why Prajna? Prajna is understanding. The
Buddha made Prajna one of the two corner-stones of His Dhamma because
he did not wish to leave any room for superstition.</li>
<li>What is Karuna? And why Karuna? Karuna is love. Because
without it, Society can neither live nor grow; that is why the Buddha
made it the second corner-stone of His Dhamma.</li>
<li>Such is the definition of the Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma.</li>
<li>How different is this definition of Dhamma from that of
Religion.</li>
<li>So ancient, yet so modern, is the definition of Dhamma given
by the Buddha.</li>
<li>So aboriginal, yet so original.</li>
<li>Not borrowed from anyone, yet so true.</li>
<li>A unique amalgam of Pradnya and Karuna is the Dhamma of the
Buddha.</li>
<li>Such is the difference between Religion and Dhamma.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. The Purpose of Religion and the Purpose of Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of Religion? What is the purpose of Dhamma?
Are they one and the same? Or are they different</li>
<li>The answer to these questions are to be found in two
dialogues&ndash;one between the Buddha and Sunakkhatta, and the other
between the Buddha and the Brahmin Potthapada.</li>
<li>The Exalted One was once staying among the Mallas, at Anupiya,
one of their towns.</li>
<li>Now the Exalted One ,having robed himself in the early morning,
put on his cloak and took his bowl and entered the town for alms.</li>
<li>On the way, he thought it was too early to go for alms.
Therefore he went to the pleasance where Bhaggava the wanderer dwelt,
and called on him.</li>
<li>On seeing the Blessed One Bhaggava got up, saluted him, and
said, &ldquo;May it please you, sire, to be seated; here is a seat made
ready for you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Exalted One sat down thereon, and Bhaggava, taking a
certain low stool sat down beside him. So seated, Bhaggava, the
wanderer, spake thus to the Exalted One :<br>
8 &ldquo;Some days ago, Lord, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta of the
Licchavis called on me and spake thus: &lsquo;I have now given up the
Exalted One, Bhaggava. I am remaining no longer under him (as my
teacher).&rsquo; Is the fact really so, just as he said?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is just so, Bhaggava, as Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis
said,&rdquo; replied the Blessed One.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some days ago, Bhaggava, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta,
the Licchavi, came to call on me, and spake thus: &lsquo;Sir, I now give up
the Exalted One. I will henceforth remain no longer under him (as my
teacher).&rsquo; When he told me this, I said to him: &lsquo;But now, Sunakkhatta,
have I ever said to you, Come, Sunakkhatta, live under me (as my
pupil)?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;No sir, you have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;Sir, I would fain dwell under
the Exalted One (as my teacher)?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;No sir, I have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then I asked him &lsquo;If I said not the one, and you said not the
other, what are you and what am I, that you talk of giving up? See,
foolish one, in how far the fault here is your own.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, but, sir, the Exalted One works me no mystic wonders
surpassing the power of ordinary men.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: &lsquo;Come, take me
as your teacher, Sunakkhatta, and I will work for you mystic wonders
surpassing the power of ordinary men?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have not, sir.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;Sir, I would fain take the
Exalted One as my teacher, for he will work for me mystic wonders
beyond the powers of ordinary men?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not, sir.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of giving up? What
think you, Sunakkhatta? Whether mystic wonders beyond the power of
ordinary man are wrought, or whether they are not, is the object for
which I teach the Dhamma: that it leads to the thorough, destruction
of ill for the doer thereof?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whether, sir, they are so wrought or not, that is indeed the
object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
mystic wonders are wrought or not, of what use to you would be the
working of them? See, foolish one, in how far the fault here is your
own.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, sir, the Exalted One does not reveal to me the
beginning of things.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: &lsquo;Come,
Sunakkhatta, be my. disciple and I will reveal to you the beginning of
things?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, you have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;I will become the Exalted One&rsquo;s
pupil, for he will reveal to me the beginning of things?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, I have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if I have not said the one and you have not said the
other, what are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of
giving up on that account? What think you, Sunakkhatta? Whether the
beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, is the object
for which I teach the Dhamma, that it leads to the thorough
destruction of ill for the doer thereof?</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether, sir, they are revealed or not, that is indeed the
object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, of what use
to you would it be to have the beginning of things revealed?'&rdquo;</li>
<li>This illustrates that Religion is concerned with revealing the
beginning of things and Dhamma is not.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3 part 2 &ndash; The other differences between Religion and Dhamma are
brought out in the discussion between the Blessed One and Potthapada.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed One was once staying at Shravasti in
Anathapindika&rsquo;s pleasance of the Jeta&rsquo;s wood. Now at that time
Potthapada, the wandering mendicant, was dwelling in the hall put up
in Queen Mallika&rsquo;s park for a debate on general systems of
philosophical opinion.</li>
<li>There was with him a great following of mendicants; to wit,
three hundred. A dialogue took place between the Blessed Lord and
Potthapada. Potthapada asked:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then, sir, if that be so, tell me at least, is the world
eternal? Is this alone the truth, and any other view mere folly?'&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That, Potthapada, is a matter on which I have expressed no
opinion,&rdquo; replied the Blessed Lord.</li>
<li>Then, in the same terms, Potthapada asked each of the following
questions:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) &lsquo;Is the world not eternal?&rsquo;<br>
(ii) &lsquo;Is the world finite?&rsquo;<br>
(iii) &lsquo;Is the world infinite?&rsquo;<br>
(iv) &lsquo;Is the soul the same as the body?&rsquo;<br>
(v) &lsquo;Is the soul one thing, and the body another?&rsquo;<br>
(vi) &lsquo;Does one who has gained the truth live again after death?&rsquo;<br>
(vii) &lsquo;Does he not live again after death?&rsquo;<br>
(viii) &lsquo;Does he both live again and not live again, after death?&rsquo;<br>
(ix) &lsquo;Does he neither live again, nor not live again, after death?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>And to each questions the Exalted One made the same reply:&ndash;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That too, Potthapada, is a matter on which I have expressed no
opinion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But why has the Exalted One expressed no opinion on that?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because this question is not calculated to profit, it is not
concerned with the Dhamma, it does not redound even to the elements of
right conduct, nor to detachment, nor to purification from lusts, nor
to quietude, nor to tranquillisation of heart, nor to real knowledge,
nor to the insight (of the higher stages of the Path), nor to Nirvana.
Therefore is it that I express no opinion upon it. &quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then what is it that the Exalted One has determined?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have expounded, Potthapada, what Dukkha is; I have
expounded what is the origin of Dukkha; I have expounded what is the
cessation of Dukkha; I have expounded what is the method by which one
may reach the cessation of Dukkha.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And why has the Exalted One put forth a statement as to
that?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because that question, Potthapada, is calculated to profit,
is concerned with the Dhamma, redounds to the beginnings of right
conduct, to detachment, to purification from lusts, to quietude, to
tranquillisation of heart, to real knowledge, to the insight of the
higher stages of the Path, and to Nirvana. Therefore is it,
Potthapada, that I have put forward a statement as to that.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In this dialogue it is clearly put forth what is the subject
matter of Religion, and what is not the subject matter of Dhamma. The
two are poles apart</li>
<li>The purpose of Religion is to explain the origin of the world.
The purpose of Dhamma is to reconstruct the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Morality and Religion</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the place of morality in Religion?</li>
<li>As a matter of truth, morality has no place in Religion.</li>
<li>The content of religion consists of God, soul, prayers,
worship, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices.</li>
<li>Morality comes in only wherein man comes in relation to man.</li>
<li>Morality comes into religion as a side wind, to maintain peace
and order.</li>
<li>Religion is a triangular piece.</li>
<li>Be good to your neighbour, because you are both children of
God.</li>
<li>That is the argument of religion.</li>
<li>Every religion preaches morality, but morality is not the root
of religion.</li>
<li>It is a wagon attached to it. It is attached and detached as
the occasion requires.</li>
<li>The action of morality in the functioning of religion is
therefore casual and occasional.</li>
<li>Morality in religion is therefore not effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Dhamma and Morality</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the place of morality in Dhamma?</li>
<li>The simple answer is, Morality is Dhamma and Dhamma is
Morality.</li>
<li>In other words, in Dhamma morality takes the place of God,
although there is no God in Dhamma.</li>
<li>In Dhamma there is no place for prayers, pilgrimages, rituals,
ceremonies, or sacrifices.</li>
<li>Morality is the essence of Dhamma. Without it there is no
Dhamma.</li>
<li>Morality in Dhamma arises from the direct necessity for man to
love man.</li>
<li>It does not require the sanction of God. It is not to please
God that man has to be moral. It is for his own good that man has to
love man.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 6. Mere Morality is not Enough: it must be Sacred and Universal</p>
<ol>
<li>When is a thing sacred? Why is a thing sacred?</li>
<li>In every human society, primitive or advanced, there are some
things or beliefs which it regards as sacred, and the rest [it
regards] as profane.</li>
<li>When a thing or belief has reached the stage of being sacred
(pavitra), it means that it cannot be violated. Indeed it cannot be
touched. It is taboo.</li>
<li>Contrary to this, a thing or a belief which is profane
(apavitra), i.e., outside the field of the sacred, may be violated. It
means one can act contrary to it, without feeling any fear or qualms
of conscience.</li>
<li>The sacred is something holy. To transgress it is a
sacrilege.</li>
<li>Why is a thing made sacred? To confine the scope of the
question to the matter in hand, why morality should [=should
morality] have been made sacred?</li>
<li>Three factors seem to have played their part in making morality
sacred.</li>
<li>The first factor is the social need for protecting the best.</li>
<li>The background of this question lies imbedded in what is called
the struggle of existence and the survival of the fittest.</li>
<li>This arises out of the theory of evolution. It is common
knowledge that evolution takes place through a struggle for existence,
because the means of food supply in early times were so limited.</li>
<li>The struggle is bitter. Nature is said to be red in claw and
tooth.</li>
<li>In this struggle, which is bitter and bloody, only the fittest
survive.</li>
<li>Such is the original state of society.</li>
<li>In the course of [the] ancient past someone must have raised
the question, is the fittest (the strongest) the best? Would not the
weakest, if protected, be ultimately the best for advancing the ends
and aims of society?</li>
<li>The then prevailing state of society seems to have given an
answer in the affirmative.</li>
<li>Then comes, the question what is the way to protect the
weak?</li>
<li>Nothing less than to impose some restraints upon the
fittest.</li>
<li>In this lies the origin and necessity for morality.</li>
<li>This morality had to be sacred, because it was imposed
originally on the fittest, i.e., the strongest.</li>
<li>This has very serious consequences.</li>
<li>First, does morality in becoming social become anti-social?</li>
<li>It is not that there is no morality among thieves. There is
morality among businessmen. There is morality among fellow castemen
and there is also morality among a gang of robbers.</li>
<li>But this morality is marked by isolation and exclusiveness. It
is a morality to protect &ldquo;group interest.&rdquo; It is therefore
anti-social.</li>
<li>It is the isolation and exclusiveness of this kind of morality
which throws its anti-social spirit in[to] relief.</li>
<li>The same is true where a group observes morality because it
has interests of its own to protect.</li>
<li>The results of this group organisation of society are
far-reaching.</li>
<li>If society continues to consist of anti-social groups, society
will remain a disorganised and a factional society.</li>
<li>The danger of a disorganised and factional state of society is
that it sets up a number of different models and standards.</li>
<li>In the absence of common models and common standards, society
cannot be a harmonious whole,</li>
<li>With such different models and standards, it is impossible for
the individual to attain consistency of mind.</li>
<li>A society which rests upon the supremacy of one group over
another, irrespective of its rational or proportionate claims,
inevitably leads to conflict.</li>
<li>The only way to put a stop to conflict is to have common rules
of morality which are sacred to all.</li>
<li>There is the third factor which requires morality to be made
sacred and universal. It is to safeguard the growth of the
individual.</li>
<li>Under the struggle for existence or under group rule the
interests of the individuals are not safe.</li>
<li>The group set-up prevents an individual from acquiring
consistency of mind, which is possible only when society has common
ideals, common models. His thoughts are led astray, and this creates a
mind whose seeing unity is forced and distorted.</li>
<li>Secondly, the group set-up leads to discrimination and denial
of justice.</li>
<li>The group set-up leads to stratification of classes. Those who
are masters remain masters, and those who are born in slavery remain
slaves. Owners remain owners, and workers remain workers. The
privileged remain privileged, and the serfs remain serfs.</li>
<li>This means that there can be liberty for some, but not for
all. This means that there can be equality for a few, but none for
the majority.</li>
<li>What is the remedy? The only remedy lies in making fraternity
universally effective.</li>
<li>What is fraternity? It is nothing but another name for [the]
brotherhood of men&ndash;which is another name for morality.</li>
<li>This is why the Buddha preached that Dhamma is morality; and
as Dhamma is sacred, so is morality.</li>

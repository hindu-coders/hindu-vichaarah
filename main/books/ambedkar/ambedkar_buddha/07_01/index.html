Meeting between the Buddha and Sariputta</a>*</p>
<p>§1. The Centres of His Preachings</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not that after the appointment of the missionaries the
Lord sat at one place. He too continued to be his own missionary.</li>
<li>Of such centres, the chief were Shravasti and Rajagraha.</li>
<li>He visited Shravasti about 75 times, and Rajagraha about 24
times.</li>
<li>Certain other places were made minor centres.</li>
<li>They were Kapilavastu, which he visited 6 times; Vesali, which
he visited 6 times; and Kamas-sadhamma, 4 times.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. The Places He Visited</p>
<ol>
<li>Besides these main and minor centres, the Blessed Lord visited
many other places during the course of his missionary tour.</li>
<li>He visited Ukkatha, Nadika, Sal, Assapura, Ghoshitaram,
Nalanda, Appana, Etuma.</li>
<li>He visited Opasad, lccha-naukal, Chandal Kuppa, Kushinara.</li>
<li>He visited Devadaha, Pava, Ambasanda, Setavya, Anupiya, and
Ugunma.</li>
<li>The names of the places he visited show that he travelled over
the Sakya Desa, the Kuru Desa, and [the] Anga Desa.</li>
<li>Roughly speaking, he travelled over the whole of Northern
India.</li>
<li>These appear to be a few places. But what distance do they
cover? Rajagraha from Lumbini is not less than 250 miles. This just
gives an idea of distances.</li>
<li>These distances the Lord walked on foot. He did not even use a
bullock-cart.</li>
<li>In his wanderings he had no place to stay, until later on when
his lay disciples built Viharas and resting places which he and his
Bhikkhus used as halts on their journeys. Most often he lived under
the shade of wayside trees.</li>
<li>He went from place to place, sometimes from village to
village, resolving the doubts and difficulties of those who were
willing to accept his message, controverting the arguments of those
who were his opponents, and preaching his gospel to those who, like
children, came to him for guidance.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord knew that all those who came to listen to him
were not all of them intelligent, not all of them came with an open
and a free mind.</li>
<li>He had even warned the brethren that there were three sorts of
listeners:</li>
<li>The empty-head, the fool who cannot see&ndash;though oft and oft,
unto the brethren going, he hears their talk, beginning, middle, end,
but can never grasp it. Wisdom is not his.</li>
<li>Better than he the man of scattered brains, who oft and oft,
unto the brethren going, hears all their talk, beginning, middle, end,
and seated there can grasp the very words, yet, rising, nought
retains. Blank is his mind.</li>
<li>Better than these the man of wisdom wide. He, oft and oft unto
the brethren going, hears all their talk, beginning, middle, end, and
seated there, can grasp the very words, bears all in mind, steadfast,
unwavering, skilled in the Norm and what conforms thereto.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding this, the Lord was never tired of going from
place to place preaching his gospel.</li>
<li>As a bhikkhu the Lord never had more than three pieces of
clothes [=clothing]. He lived on one meal a day, and he begged his
food from door to door every morning.</li>
<li>His mission was the hardest task assigned to any human being.
He discharged it so cheerfully.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Last Meeting between Mother and Son, and between Wife and Husband</p>
<ol>
<li>Before their death Mahaprajapati and Yeshodhara met the Blessed
Lord,</li>
<li>It was probably their last meeting with him.</li>
<li>Mahaprajapati went, and first worshipped him.</li>
<li>She thanked him for having given her the happiness of the good
doctrine; for her having been spiritually born through him; for the
doctrine having grown in her through him; for her having suckled him,
drinking the Dhamma-milk of him; for her having plunged in and crossed
over the ocean of becoming through him&ndash;what a glorious thing it has
been to be known as the mother of the Buddha!</li>
<li>And then she uttered her plea: &ldquo;I desire to die, finally having
put away this corpse. O sorrow-ender, permit me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Yeshodhara, addressing the Blessed Lord, said that she was in
her seventy-eighth year. The Blessed Lord replied that he was in his
eighties.</li>
<li>She told him that she was to die that very night. Her tone was
more self-reliant than that of Mahaprajapati. She did not ask his
permission to die, nor did she go to him to seek him as her refuge.</li>
<li>On the contrary, she said to him (me saranam atthano), &quot; I am
my own refuge.&rdquo;</li>
<li>She had conquered all the cankers in her life.</li>
<li>She came to thank him, because it was he who had shown her the
way and given her the power.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Last Meeting between Father and Son</p>
<ol>
<li>Once when the Lord was staying at Raja-graha in the bamboo
grove, Rahula was staying at Ambalathika.</li>
<li>The Blessed One, arising towards eventide from his meditation,
went over to Rahula, who seeing the Lord some way off, set a seat for
him and water to wash his feet.</li>
<li>Seating himself on the seat set for him, the Lord poured water
over his feet, while Rahula, after salutations, took his seat to one
side.</li>
<li>Addressing Rahula, the Blessed Lord said, &ldquo;He who does not
shrink from deliberate lying has not, say I, left undone any evil
thing which he could. Therefore, you must school yourself never to
tell a lie even in jest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;In the same way you must reflect, and again in doing every
act, in speaking every word, and in thinking every thought.</li>
<li>&ldquo;When you want to do anything, you must reflect whether it
would conduce to your or others&rsquo; harm or to both, and so is a wrong
act productive of woe and ripening into woe. If reflection tells you
that this is the nature of that contemplated act, you should not do
it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;But if reflection assures you there is no harm but good in it,
then you may do it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in loving kindness; for as you do so, malevolence will
pass away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in compassion; for as you do so, vexation will pass
away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in gladness over others&rsquo; welfare; for as you do so,
aversions will pass away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in poised equanimity; for as you do so, all repugnance
will pass away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in contemplation of the body&rsquo;s corruption; for as you do
so, passion will pass away.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Grow in perception of the fleeting nature of things; for as
you do so, the pride of self will fall away.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Thus spoke the Lord. Glad at heart, Rahula rejoiced in what
the Lord had said.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Last Meeting between the Buddha and Sariputta</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed Lord was staying in Shravasti, in the Jetavana in
the Gaudhakuti Vihar.</li>
<li>Sariputta arrived there with a company of five hundred
brethren.</li>
<li>After saluting the Blessed One, Sariputta told him that the
last day of his life on earth had arrived. Will the Blessed Lord be
pleased to permit him to give up his mortal coils [=body]?</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord asked Sariputta if he had selected any place
for his parinibbana.</li>
<li>Sariputta told the Blessed One, &ldquo;I was born in the village
Nalaka in Magadha. The house in which I was born still stands. I have
chosen my home for my parinibbana.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Lord replied, &ldquo;Dear Sariputta! Do what pleases you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sariputta fell on the feet of the Blessed Lord arid said, &ldquo;I
have practised the paramitas for one thousand Kalpas with only one
wish: to have the honour of falling on [=at] your feet. I have
achieved that end, and there is no end to my happiness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We do not believe in rebirth. Therefore this is our last
meeting. Let the Lord forgive me my faults. My last day has come.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sariputta! There is nothing to forgive,&rdquo; said the Lord.</li>
<li>When Sariputta rose to go, the Lord in his honour got up, and
stood up on the verandah of the Gauohakuti Vihar.</li>
<li>Then Sariputta said to the Blessed Lord, &ldquo;I was happy when I
saw you first. I am happy to see you now. I know this is the last
darshan of you [that] I am having. I shall not have your darshan
again.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Joining together the palms of his hand[s], he walked away
without showing his back to the Blessed Lord.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed Lord said to the assembled brethren, &ldquo;Follow
your Elder Brother&rdquo;&ndash;and the assembly for the first time left the
Blessed Lord and went after Sariputta.</li>
<li>Sariputta, on reaching his village, died in his home, in the
very room in which he was born.</li>
<li>He was cremated, and his ashes were taken to the Blessed
Lord.</li>
<li>On receiving the ashes, the Blessed Lord said to the brethren,
&ldquo;He was the wisest, he had no acquisitive instinct, he was energetic
and industrious, he hated sin&ndash;ye brethren, see his ashes! He was as
strong as the earth in his forgiveness, he never allowed anger to
enter his mind, he was never controlled by any desire, he had
conquered all his passions, he was full of sympathy, fellowship and
love.&rdquo;</li>
<li>About that time Mahamogallan was then living in a solitary
Vihar near Rajagraha. He was murdered by some assassins employed by
the enemies of the Blessed Lord.</li>
<li>The sad news of his end was conveyed to the Blessed One.
Sariputta and Mahamogallan were his two chief disciples. They were
called Dharma-Senapati&ndash;Defenders of the Faith. The Blessed Lord
depended upon them to continue the spread of his gospel.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord was deeply affected by their death in his
lifetime.</li>
<li>He did not like to stay in Shravasti; and to relieve his mind,
he decided to move on.</li>

Must Fight to Spread Virtue (Dhamma)</a>*</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Bhikkhu&rsquo;s Duty to Convert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The news of the conversion of Yasa and his four friends to the
Dhamma spread far and wide. The result was that lay persons belonging
to the highest families in the country, and to those next to the
highest, came to be instructed in the doctrine of the Blessed One, and
to take refuge in him and in his Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people were coming to him to receive instruction in the
Dhamma. The Lord knew that it was difficult for him personally to give
instruction to each one. He also felt the necessity of organising
[the] Parivrajakas, whose number was swelling every day, into a
religious order which he called the Sangh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He accordingly made the Parivrajakas the members of the Sangh,
and framed rules of discipline called vinaya, and made them binding
upon the members of the Sangh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Blessed Lord later on laid down two stages to be undergone
by a disciple before he became a Bhikkhu. First a disciple became a
Parivrajaka and remained a Parivrajaka for a certain number of years,
attached to a Bhikkhu and remaining in training under him. After his
training period was over, he was allowed to take Upasampada if he
satisfied a body of examiners that he was fit for it. It is only then
that he was allowed to become a Bhikkhu and a member of the Sangh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was no time in the early stages of the Dhamma to make
such arrangements. The Lord, therefore, made them Bhikkhus and sent
them out as Missionaries to spread his religion to anywhere and
everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And before sending them out, the Blessed One said to the
Bhikkhus: &ldquo;I am delivered, O Bhikkhus, from all fetters, human and
divine. You, O Bhikkhus, from all fetters, human and divine. Go ye
now, and wander for the gain of the many, for the welfare of the many,
out of compassion for the world; for the good, for the gain and for
the welfare of gods and men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Let not two of you go the same way. Preach, Bhikkhus, the
doctrine which is glorious in the beginning, glorious in the middle,
glorious at the end, in the spirit and in the letter; proclaim a
consummate, perfect, and pure life of holiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Go then through every country, convert those not yet
converted; throughout the world that lies burnt up with sorrow, teach
everywhere; (instruct) those lacking right instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Go where there are great Rishis, royal Rishis, Brahman Rishis
too; these all dwell there, influencing men according to their
schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Go, therefore, each one travelling by himself; filled with
compassion, go! rescue and receive.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Blessed Lord also told them:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;That the gift of the Dhamma exceeds all gifts; the sweetness
of the Dhamma exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the Dhamma exceeds
all delights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by
passion; therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by
hatred; therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The fields are damaged by weeds; mankind is damaged by
vanity; therefore the gift of Dhamma brings great reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust;
therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the sixty Bhikkhus, receiving orders to carry on the
mission to propagate the Dhamma, went through every land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lord gave them further instruction in the matter of
conversions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. Conversion Not to be by Miracles</p>
<ol>
<li>The Exalted One was once staying among the Mallas, at Anapiya,
one of their towns.</li>
<li>Now the Exalted One, having robed himself, put on his cloak,
and took his bowl, and entered the town for alms.</li>
<li>The Blessed One thought: &ldquo;It is too early for me now to go
through Anapiya for alms. I might go to the pleasance where
Bhaggava,the wanderer dwells, and call upon him.&rdquo;</li>
<li>So the Exalted One went to the pleasance and to the place where
Bhaggava the wanderer was.</li>
<li>Then Bhaggava spake thus to the Exalted One: &ldquo;Let my Lord, the
Exalted One come near. Welcome to the Exalted One! It is long since
the Exalted One has taken the opportunity to come our way. May it
please you, Sir, to be seated; here is a seat made ready.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Exalted One sat down thereon, and Bhaggava, taking a
certain low stool, sat down beside him. So seated, Bhaggava the
wanderer spake thus to the Exalted One:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some days ago, Lord, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis called on me
and spake thus: &lsquo;I have now given up the Exalted One, Bhaggava. I am
remaining no longer under him as my teacher.&rsquo; Is the fact really
so?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is just so, Bhaggava, as Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis
said.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some days ago, Bhaggava, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta,
the Licchavi, came to call on me, and spake thus: &lsquo;Sir, I now give up
the Exalted One, I will henceforth remain no longer under him as my
teacher.&rsquo; When he told me this, I said to him: &lsquo;But, now, Sunakkhatta,
have I ever said to you: &lsquo;Come, Sunakkhatta, live under me as my
pupil?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Sir, you have not&rsquo;, replied Sunakkhatta.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;Sir, I would fain dwell under
the Exalted One (as my teacher)?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Sir, I have not,&rsquo; said Sunakkhatta.</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
are you and what am I, that you talk of giving up?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, but. Sir, the Exalted One works me no mystic wonders
surpassing the power of ordinary men.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why, now, Sunakkhatta, have lever said to you: &lsquo;Come, take
me as your teacher, Sunakkhatta, and I will work for you mystic
wonders surpassing the power of ordinary men?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have not, Sir.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;Sir, I would fain take the
Exalted One as my teacher, for he will work for me mystic wonders
beyond the powers of ordinary men?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not, Sir.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of giving up? What
think you, Sunakkhatta?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Whether mystic wonders beyond the power of ordinary men are
wrought, or whether they are not, is not the object for which I teach
the Dhamma this: that it leads to the thorough destruction of ill for
the doer thereof?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether, Sir, they are wrought or not, that is indeed the
object for which the Norm is taught by the Exalted One.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went on saying to me, &lsquo;Sir, the
Exalted One does not reveal to me the beginning of things.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: &lsquo;Come,
Sunakkhatta, be my disciple and I will reveal to you the beginning of
things?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, you have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or have you ever said to me: &lsquo;I will become the Exalted One&rsquo;s
pupil, for he will reveal to me the beginning of things?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, I have not.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if I have not said the one and you have not said the
other, what are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of
giving up on that account? What [is it to] you, Sunakkhatta? Whether
the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, is the
object for which I teach the Dhamma this: that it leads to the
thorough destruction of ill for the doer thereof?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether, Sir, they are revealed or not, that is indeed the
object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, of what use
to you would it be to have the beginning of things revealed?&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken my praises among
the Vajjins.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken the praises of
the Dhamma among the Vajjins.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken the praises of
the Order among the Vajjins.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I tell you, Sunakkhatta, I make known to you, that there will
be those that shall say concerning you thus: &lsquo;Sunakkhatta of the
Licchavis was not able to live the holy life under Gautama the
recluse. And he, not being able to adhere to it, hath renounced the
discipline and turned to lower things.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta of the Licchayis, addressed
by me, depart from this Doctrine and Discipline, as one doomed to
disaster.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And soon after, leaving the Doctrine and Discipline of the
Buddha, Sunakkhatta started telling people that there was nothing
superhuman about the Buddha&rsquo;s ennobling gifts of knowledge and
insight; that it was his own reasoning which had hammered out a
doctrine of his own evolving and of his personal invention, such that
whoso hears it preached for his good has only to act up to it to be
guided to the utter ending of ill.</li>
<li>Although Sunakkhatta was slandering the Buddha, what he was
telling people was true. For the Buddha never resorted to the
superhuman or the miraculous in propagating his Doctrine.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Conversion Not to be by Force</p>
<ol>
<li>The Blessed One was once going along the high road between
Rajagraha and Nalanda with a great company of the brethren,—with about
five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant, too, was going along
the high road between Rajagraha and Nalanda with his disciple, the
youth Brahmadatta.</li>
<li>Now just then, Suppiya the mendicant was speaking in many ways
in dispraiseof the Buddha, in dispraise of the Doctrine, in dispraise
of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his pupil, gave utterance, in
many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise of the Doctrine, to
praise of the Order.</li>
<li>Thus they two, teacher and pupil, holding opinions in direct
contradiction one to the other, were following, step by step, after
the Blessed One and the comany of the brethren.</li>
<li>Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the
Ambalatthika pleasance to pass the night, and with him the company of
the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his
young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two
carried on the same discussion as before.</li>
<li>And in the early dawn a number of the brethren assembled, as
they rose up, in the pavilion; and the subject of the talk that sprang
up among them was the conversation between Suppiya and Bramhadatta.</li>
<li>Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their
talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out
for him. And when he had sat down he said: &ldquo;What is the talk on which
you are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the
conversation between you?&rdquo; And they told him all. And he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me or against the
Doctrine, or against the Order, you should not on that account either
bear malice, or suffer heart-burning, or feel ill-will.</li>
<li>&ldquo;If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that would
stand in the way of your own self-conquest. If, when others speak
against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be
able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That would not be so, Sir.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the
Doctrine, or of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point
it out as wrong, saying: ' or this or that reason this is not the
fact, that is not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in
us.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But also, brethren, outsiders may speak in praise of me, in
praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order. What are the things
when they would say praising me you would say?</li>
<li>&ldquo;He may say &lsquo;Putting away the killing of living things,
Gautama the recluse holds aloof from the destruction of life. He has
laid the cudgel and the sword aside; and ashamed of roughness, and
full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that
have life.&rsquo; It is thus that the unconverted man, when speaking in
praise of the Tathagata, might speak.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Putting away the taking of what has not
been given, Gautama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not
his own. He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will
come, he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Putting away unchastity, Gautama the
recluse is chaste. He holds himself aloof, far off, from the vulgar
practice, from the sexual act.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Putting away lying words, Gautama the
recluse holds himself aloof from falsehood. He speaks truth, from the
truth he never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he breaks not his
word to the world.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Putting away slander, Gautama the recluse
holds himself aloof from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not
elsewhere to raise a quarrel against the people here; what he hears
elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people
there. Thus does he live as a binder-together of those who are
divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover
of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for
peace.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Putting away rudeness of speech, Gautama
the recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsover word is
blameless, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane,
pleasing to the people, beloved of the people—such are words he
speaks.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say : ' Putting away frivolous talk, Gotama the
recluse holds himself aloof from vain conversation. In season he
speaks, in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on
religion, on the discipline of the Order. He speaks, and at the right
time, words worthy to be laid up in one&rsquo;s heart, fitly illustrated,
clearly divided, to the point.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Or he might say: &lsquo;Gautama the recluse holds himself aloof
from causing injury to seeds or plants.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from
food after hours (after midday).<br>
&lsquo;He refrains from being a spectator at shows, at fairs with nautch
dances, singing, and music.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from wearing, [or] adorning or ornamenting himself
with, garlands, scents, and unguents.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from the use of large and lofty beds.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting silver or gold.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting uncooked grain.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting women or girls.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting bond-men or bond-women.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting sheep or goats.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting fowls or swine.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses and mares.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from accepting cultivated fields or waste.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from acting as a go-between or messenger.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from buying and selling.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from cheating with scales or bronzes or measures.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, cheating and fraud.<br>
&lsquo;He abstains from maiming, murder, putting in bonds; highway
robbery, dacoity, and violence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="20">
<li>&ldquo;Such are the things, brethren, which an unconverted man, when
speaking in praise of the Tathagata, might say. But you should not,
even on that account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be
lifted up in heart. Were you to be so, that also would stand in the
way of your self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of
the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to
be the fact, saying: &lsquo;For this or that reason this is the fact; that
is so; such a thing is found among us, is in us.'&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. A Bhikkhu Must Fight to Spread Virtue (Dhamma)</p>
<ol>
<li>Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord once said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is not I, O disciples, that quarrel with the world,&rdquo; said
the Lord, &ldquo;but the world that quarrels with me. A teacher of the truth
does not quarrel with anyone in the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Warriors, warriors, Lord, we call ourselves. In what way then
are we warriors?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We wage war, O disciples, therefore we are called warriors.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wherefore, Lord, do we wage war?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;For lofty virtues, for high endeavour, for sublime wisdom—for
these things do we wage war; therefore we are called warriors.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Where virtue is in danger do not avoid fighting, do not be
mealy-mouthed.</li>
</ol>

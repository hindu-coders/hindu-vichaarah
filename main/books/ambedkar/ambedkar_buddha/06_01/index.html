<p>§ 1. Gift from King Bimbisara</p>
<ol>
<li>King Bimbisara was not merely a follower of the Blessed Lord;
he was also a great devotee, and a great supporter of his Dhamma.</li>
<li>After his becoming a lay disciple, Bimbisara asked, &ldquo;Might the
Blessed Lord consent to take his meal with me tomorrow, together with
the fraternity of the monks?&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.</li>
<li>Then King Bimbisara, when he understood that the Blessed One
had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted
the Blessed One, and, passing round him with his right side towards
him, went away.</li>
<li>And when the night had elapsed, Bimbisara ordered excellent
food to be prepared, and at [that] time announced to the Blessed One
in the words: &ldquo;It is time. Lord, the meal is ready.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his
under-robe, took his alms-bowl, and with his robe on, entered the city
of Rajagraha, accompanied by monks who had all been Jatilas before.</li>
<li>And the Blessed One went to the palace of King Bimbisara.
Having gone there, he sat down with the monks who followed him, on
seats laid out for them. Then King Bimbisara with his own hands served
the fraternity of monks with the Buddha at its head; and when the
Blessed One had finished his meal and cleaned his bowl and his hands,
he sat down near him.</li>
<li>Sitting near him King Bimbisara thought: &ldquo;Where may I find a
place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the village and
not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible for
people who keep on seeking him, by day not too crowded, where there is
little sound, little noise by night, sequestered, hidden from men,
well fitted for a retired life?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And King Bimbisara thought: &ldquo;There is the Veluvana, my pleasure
garden, which is not too far from the town and not too near, suitable
for going and coming. What if I were to make an offering of the
Veluvana pleasure garden to the fraternity of monks, with the Buddha
at its head?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And King Bimbisara took a golden vessel with water in it, to
be poured over the Buddha&rsquo;s hand; and made a gift to the Blessed One,
saying, &ldquo;I give this Veluvana pleasure garden, Lord, to the fraternity
of monks with the Buddha at its head.&rdquo; The Blessed One accepted the
park.</li>
<li>Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated,
and gladdened King Bimbisara by religious discourse, rose from his
seat and went away.</li>
<li>And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having
delivered a religious discourse, addressed the monks: &ldquo;I allow you,
monks, to receive this donation of a park.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 2. Gift from Anathapindika</p>

<li>After his conversion, Anathapindika once went to the Blessed
Lord. Taking his seat on his right side, he said:</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Lord knows that I dwell in Shravasti, a land rich in
produce, and enjoying peace; Pasendi is the great king thereof.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now am I wishful to found a Vihar there. I pray you, of your
tenderness, come to Shravasti and accept it from me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord kept silent and thereby showed his willingness
to accept the gift.</li>
<li>Anathapindika, the friend of the destitute and the supporter of
orphans, having returned home, saw the garden of the heir-apparent,
Jeta, with its green groves and limpid rivulets, and thought: &ldquo;This is
the place which will be most suitable as a Vihara for the fraternity
of the Blessed One.&rdquo; And he went to the prince and asked leave to buy
the ground.</li>
<li>The prince was not inclined to sell the garden, for he valued
it highly. He at first refused, but said at last: &ldquo;If you can cover it
with gold, then, and for no other price, shall you have it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anathapindika rejoiced and began to spread his gold; but Jeta
said: &ldquo;Spare yourself trouble, for I will not sell.&rdquo; But Anathapindika
insisted. Thus they differed and contended, until they resorted to the
magistrate.</li>
<li>Meanwhile the people began to talk of the unwonted proceeding;
and the prince, hearing more of the details, and knowing that
Anathapindika was not only very wealthy but also straightforward and
sincere, inquired into his plans. On hearing the name of the Blessed
One, the prince became anxious to share in the foundation, and he
accepted only one-half of the gold, saying: &ldquo;Yours is the land, but
mine are the trees. I will give the trees as my share of the offering
to the Lord.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having made the foundation, they began to build the hall which
rose loftily in due proportions, according to the directions which the
Blessed One had given; and it was beautifully decorated with
appropriate carvings.</li>
<li>This Vihara was called Jetavana, and the friend of the orphans
invited the Lord to come to Shravasti and receive the gift. And the
Blessed One left Kapilavastu and came to Shravasti.</li>
<li>While the Blessed One entered Jetavana, Anathapindika
scattered flowers and burned incense, and as a sign of the gift he
poured water from a golden dragon pitcher, saying, &ldquo;This Jetavana
Vihara I give for the use of the brotherhood throughout the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One received the gift, and replied: &ldquo;May all evil
influences be overcome; may the offering promote the kingdom of
righteousness, and be a permanent blessing to mankind in general and
especially also to the giver.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anathapindika was one of the eighty chief disciples who bore
the title of Chief Almsgiver.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. Gift from Jeevaka</p>
<ol>
<li>Jeevaka the physician visited the Blessed One twice a day,
whenever the Blessed One happened to be in Rajagraha.</li>
<li>Jeevaka found the Veluvana, gifted away to the Blessed One by
King Bimbisara, too far away.</li>
<li>Jeevaka had his own park in Rajagraha, known as Ambavana, which
was much nearer from [=to] his place.</li>
<li>He thought of building a Vihara with all its adjuncts, and
present[ing] the Ambavana and the Vihara to the Blessed One.</li>
<li>With this idea in his mind he approached the Blessed One, and
requested him to let him fulfil his wishes.</li>
<li>The Blessed Lord showed his acceptance by remaining silent.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 4. Gift from Ambrapali</p>
<ol>
<li>Now the Exalted One was staying at Nadika and was wishing for a
change. He addressed Ananda, and said: &ldquo;Come, Ananda, let us go on to
Vesali.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;So be it. Lord,&rdquo; said Ananda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</li>
<li>Then the Exalted One proceeded, with a great company of the
brethren, to Vesali, and there at Vesali, the Exalted One stayed at
Ambrapali&rsquo;s grove.</li>
<li>Now the courtesan Ambrapali heard that the Exalted One had
arrived at Vesali, and was staying there at her mango grove. And
ordering a number of state vehicles to be made ready, she mounted one
of them, and went forth with her train from Vesali towards her garden.
She went in the carriage as far as the ground was passable for
carriages; there she alighted, and she proceeded on foot to the place
where the Exalted One was, and took her seat respectfully on one side.
And when she was thus seated the Exalted One instructed her with
religious discourse.</li>
<li>Then she addressed the Exalted One, and said: &quot; May the Exalted
One do me the honour of taking his meal, together with the brethren,
at my house tomorrow ? &quot;</li>
<li>And the Exalted One gave, by silence, his consent. Then when
Ambrapali the courtesan saw that the Exalted One had consented, she
rose from her seat and bowed down before him; and keeping him on her
right hand as she passed him, she departed thence.</li>
<li>Now the Licchavis of Vesali heard that the Exalted One had
arrived at Vesali, and was staying at Ambrapali&rsquo;s grove. They too
wanted to invite the Buddha to their place for a meal. And ordering a
number of state carriages to be made ready, they each mounted one of
them and went forth with their train from Vesali.</li>
<li>They and Ambrapali crossed on the way.</li>
<li>And Ambrapali drove up against the young Licchavis, axle to
axle, wheel to wheel, and yoke to yoke, and the Licchavis said to
Ambrapali the courtesan, &ldquo;How is it, Ambrapali, that thou drivest up
against us thus?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;My Lords, I have just invited the Exalted One and his
brethren for their morrow&rsquo;s meal,&rdquo; said Ambrapali.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ambrapali, sell this honour to us fora hundred thousand,&rdquo;
said they.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My Lords, were you to offer all Vesali with its subject
territory, I would not give it up.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Licchavis cast up their hands, exclaiming: &ldquo;We are outdone
by this mango girl. We are out-reached by this mango girl,&rdquo; and they
went on to Ambrapali&rsquo;s grove.</li>
<li>Knowing that they were outdone, they still thought of
approaching the Blessed One, in the hope that he might reconsider and
give their invitation first preference. So they went on to Ambrapali&rsquo;s
grove.</li>
<li>When the Exalted One saw the Licchavis approaching in the
distance, he addressed the brethren and said: &ldquo;Brethren, let those of
the brethren who have never seen the devas, gaze upon this company of
the Licchavis, behold this company of the Licchavis, compare this
company of the Licchavis&ndash;for they are even a company of next-world
devas.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And when they had ridden as far as the ground was passable for
carriages, the Licchavis alighted there, and then went on foot to the
place where the Exalted One was, and took their seats respectfully by
his side.</li>
<li>Then they addressed the Exalted One, and said : &ldquo;May the
Exalted One do us the honour of taking his meal, together with the
brethren, at our house tomorrow?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I have promised, Licchavis, to dine tomorrow with Ambrapali,&rdquo;
was the reply.</li>
<li>Then the Licchavis knew that they had failed. And after
expressing their thanks and approval of the words of the Exalted One,
they rose from their seats and bowed down before the Exalted One, and
keeping him on their right hand as they passed him, departed thence.</li>
<li>And at the end of the night, Ambrapali the courtesan made
ready in her mansion sweet rice and cakes, and announced the time to
the Exalted One, saying, &ldquo;The hour. Lord, has come, and the meal is
ready.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Exalted One who had dressed himself early in the
morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went with the brethren to the
place where Ambrapali&rsquo;s mansion was; and when he had come there he
seated himself on the seat prepared for him. And Ambrapali, the
courtesan, set the sweet rice and cakes before the order, with the
Buddha at their head, and waited upon them till they refused any
more.</li>
<li>And when the Blessed One had quite finished his meal, and had
cleansed the bowl and his hands, the courtesan had a low stool
brought, and sat down-at his side, and addressed the Exalted One, and
said:</li>
<li>&quot; Lord, I present my pleasance to you and to the order.&rdquo; And
the Exalted One accepted the gift; and after giving a religious
discourse, he rose from his seat and took her leave.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 5. Munificence of Vishakha</p>
<ol>
<li>Vishakha was a wealthy woman of Shravasti. She had many
children and grandchildren.</li>
<li>When the Blessed One stayed at Shravasti, Vishakha went up to
the place where the Blessed One was, and tendered Him an invitation to
take his meal at her house, which the Blessed One accepted.</li>
<li>And heavy rain fell during the night and the next morning; and
the bhikkhus doffed their robes to keep themselves dry, and let the
rain fall upon their bodies.</li>
<li>When the next day the Blessed One had finished his meal, she
took her seat at his side and spoke thus: &ldquo;Eight are the boons, Lord,
which I beg of the Blessed One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Blessed One said: &ldquo;The Tathagatas, O Vishakha, grant
no boons unless they know what they are.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Vishakha replied: &ldquo;Proper, Lord, and unobjectionable are the
boons I ask.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Having received permission to ask the boons, Vishakha said: &ldquo;I
desire. Lord, through all my life to bestow robes for the rainy season
on the Sangha, and food for incoming bhikkhus, and food for outgoing
bhikkhus, and food for the sick, and food for those who wait upon the
sick, and medicine for the sick, and a constant supply of rice-milk
for the Sangha, and bathing robes for the bhikkhunis, the sisters.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Lord, &ldquo;What, O Vishakha, have you in view, in
asking these eight boons of the Tathagata?&rdquo;</li>
<li>And Vishakha replied: &ldquo;I gave command, Lord, to my
maid-servant, saying, &lsquo;Go thou and announce to the fraternity that the
meal is ready,&rsquo; and my maid went, but when she came to the vihara, she
observed that the bhikkhus had doffed their robes, while it was
raining, and she thought: &lsquo;These are not bhikkhus, but naked ascetics
letting the rain fall on them.&rsquo; So she returned to me and reported
accordingly, and I had to send her a second time.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Impure, Lord, is nakedness, and revolting. It was this
circumstance, Lord, that I had in view in desiring to provide the
Sangha throughout my life with special garments for use in the rainy
season.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As to my second wish. Lord, an incoming bhikku, not being
able to take the direct roads, and not knowing the places where food
can be procured, comes on his way wearied out by seeking for alms. It
was this circumstance, Lord, that I had in view, in desiring to
provide the Sangha throughout my life with food for incoming
bhikkhus.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thirdly, Lord, an outgoing bhikkhu, while seeking about for
alms, may be left behind, or may arrive too late at the place whither
he desires to go, and will set out on the road in weariness.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fourthly, Lord, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable
food, his sickness may increase upon him, and he may die.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fifthy, Lord, a bhikkhu who is waiting upon the sick will
lose his opportunity of going out to seek food for himself.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sixthly, Lord, if a sick bhikkhu does not obtain suitable
medicines, his sickness may increase upon him, and he may die.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Seventhly, Lord, I have heard that the Blessed One has
praised rice-milk, because it gives readiness of mind, dispels hunger
and thirst; it is wholesome nourishment for the healthy, and for the
sick as a medicine. Therefore I desire to provide the Sangha
throughout my life with [a] constant supply of rice-milk.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Finally, Lord, the bhikkhunis are in the habit of bathing in
the river Archiravati with the courtesans, at the same landing-place,
and naked. And the courtesans. Lord, ridicule the bhikkhunis, saying,
&lsquo;What is the good, ladies, of your maintaining chastity when you are
young? When you are old, maintain chastity then; thus will you be
obtainers of both ends.&rsquo; Impure, Lord, is nakedness for a woman,
disgusting, and revolting.</li>
<li>&ldquo;These are the circumstances, Lord, that I had in view.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Blessed One said, &ldquo;But what was the advantage you had in
view for yourself, O Vishakha, in asking these eight boons of the
Tathagatha?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Vishakha replied: &ldquo;Bhikkhus who have spent the rainy season in
various places will come, Lord, to Shravasti to visit the Blessed One.
And on coming to the Blessed One they will ask, saying: &lsquo;Such and such
a bhikkhu. Lord, has died. What, now, is his destiny?&rsquo; Then will the
Blessed One explain that he has attained the fruits of conversion;
that he has entered Nirvana or attained arhantship, as the case may
be.</li>
<li>&ldquo;And I, going up to them, shall ask, &lsquo;Was that brother, sirs,
one of those who had formerly been at Shravasti?&rsquo; then shall I arrive
at the conclusion, &lsquo;For a certainty did that brother enjoy either the
robes for the rainy season, or the food for the incoming bhikkhus, or
the food for the outgoing bhikkhus, or the food for the sick, or the
food for those that wait upon the sick, or the medicine for the sick,
or the constant supply of rice-milk.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Then will gladness spring up within me; thus gladdened joy
will come to me; and so rejoicing all my frame will be at peace. Being
thus at peace, I shall experience a blissful feeling of content; and
in that bliss my heart will be at rest. That will be to me an exercise
of my moral powers, an exercise of the seven kinds of wisdom! This,
Lord, was the advantage I had in view for myself, in asking those
eight boons of the Blessed One.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then the Blessed One said, &ldquo;It is well, it is well, Vishakha.
Thou hast done well in asking these eight boons of the Tathagata with
such advantage in view. Charity bestowed upon those who are worthy of
it is like good seeds sown in good soil that yields an abundance of
fruits. But alms given to those who are yet under the tyrannical yoke
of the passions are like a seed deposited in bad soil. The passions of
the receiver of the alms choke, as it were, the growth of merits.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And the Blessed One gave thanks to Vishakha in these verses:
&ldquo;Whatsoever donation a woman upright in life, a disciple of the
Blessed One, may bestow in gladness of heart and without stint, her
gift is heavenly, destructive of sorrow, and productive of bliss.&rdquo; &quot; A
blissful life does she attain entering upon the path that is from
corruption and impurity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aiming at good, happy does she become; and
she rejoices in her charitable actions.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Vishakha gave to the Order the Purva-Aram or Eastern Garden,
and was the first to become a matron of the lay-sisters.</li>

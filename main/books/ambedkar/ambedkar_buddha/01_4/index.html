Dhamma</a>* &ndash; 4. *<a href="01_4.html#04">Gautama who was a Bodhisatta, after
Sammabodhi becomes a Buddha</a>*</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 1. Meditation for New Light</p>
<ol>
<li>Having refreshed himself with food, Gautama sat thinking over
his past experiences. He realised that all paths had failed.</li>
<li>The failure was so complete that it could have led anyone into
a state of frustration. He was, of course, sorry. But frustration as
such did not touch him.</li>
<li>He was always hopeful of finding a way. So much so that on the
night of the day on which he partook of the food sent by Sujata,
Gautama had five dreams, and when he awoke he interpreted his dreams
to mean that he was sure to attain enlightenment.</li>
<li>He had also tried to forecast his future. This he did by
throwing the bowl of food Sujata&rsquo;s maid brought, into the river
Nairanja, saying, &ldquo;If I am to have enlightenment let the bowl ascend
the stream; if not, let it go down.&rdquo; The vessel, indeed, began to
float against the current and at last sank near the abode of Kala, a
Naga king.</li>
<li>Fortified with hope and determination, he left Uruvela and
towards evening went along the wide road to Gaya. There he saw a
Banyan Tree. He thought of sitting under it in meditation, in the hope
of a new light dawning upon him and enabling him to find a way which
would solve his problem.</li>
<li>After trying each of the four directions he chose the East,
which is always chosen by all the great sages for the removal of all
defilements.</li>
<li>Gautama sat down cross-legged and upright under the Banyan
Tree. Determined to achieve enlightenment, he said to himself, &ldquo;Skin,
sinew and bone may dry up as they will, my flesh and blood may dry in
my body, but without attaining complete enlightenment I will not leave
this seat.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then Kala, the king of the Nagas, whose majesty was like the
lord of elephants, and his wife Suvarnaprabhasa, having been awakened
by the vision of Gautama sitting under the Banyan Tree, uttered this
in praise of him, being sure that he was destined to attain perfect
knowledge.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Inasmuch as the earth, pressed down by thy feet, O Sage,
resounds repeatedly, and inasmuch as thy splendour shines forth like
the sun, thou shalt assuredly reap the desired fruit.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Inasmuch as flocks of birds fluttering in the sky offer thee
reverential salutation, O Lotus-eyed One; and inasmuch as gentle
breezes blow in the sky, thou shalt certainly attain thy object.&rdquo;</li>
<li>As he sat down for meditation, a crowd of evil thoughts and
evil passions&ndash;mythologically called the children of Mara (Kama),
which is another name for evil passions&ndash;entered his mind.</li>
<li>Gautama was greatly frightened lest they should overpower him
and defeat his purpose.</li>
<li>He knew that in this battle with evil passions many Rishis and
Brahmins had succumbed.</li>
<li>So he summoned all the courage he had and said to Mara, &ldquo;Faith
is found in me, and heroism and wisdom. How can ye evil passions
defeat me? The streams even of rivers may this wind dry up. Ye would
be unable to dry up my resolutions, when I am so intent. Better to me
is death in battle than that I should be defeated in life.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The evil passions entered the mind of Gautama as a crow goes
after a stone that looks like a hump of fat, thinking surely, &ldquo;here I
shall find a tender morsel, here perchance is something sweet.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And finding no sweetness there, the crow departs thence. So
like a crow attacking a rock, the evil passions left Gautama in
disgust.</li>
</ol>
<p>§2. Enlightenment</p>
<ol>
<li>To feed himself during the period of meditation, Gautama had
collected enough food to last him for forty days.</li>
<li>Having routed the evil thoughts that disturbed his mind,
Gautama refreshed himself with food and gained strength. He thus
prepared himself for meditation with the aim of obtaining
enlightenment.</li>
<li>It took Gautama four weeks of meditation to obtain
enlightenment. He reached final enlightenment in four stages.</li>
<li>In the first stage he called forth reason and investigation.
His seclusion helped him to attain it easily.</li>
<li>In the second stage he added concentration.</li>
<li>In the third stage he brought to his aid equanimity and
mindfulness.</li>
<li>In the fourth and final stage he added purity to equanimity and
equanimity to mindfulness.</li>
<li>Thus with mind concentrated, purified, spotless, with
defilement gone, supple, dexterous, firm, impassionate
[=dispassionate], not forgetting what he is [=was] after, Gautama
concentrated himself on the problem of finding an answer to the
question which had troubled him.</li>
<li>On the night of the last day of the fourth week, light dawned
upon him. He realised that there were two problems. The first problem
was that there was suffering in the world, and the second problem was
how to remove this suffering and make mankind happy.</li>
<li>So in the end, after meditation for four weeks, darkness was
dispelled, light arose, ignorance was dispelled and knowledge arose.
He saw a new way.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 3. The Discovery of a New Dhamma</p>
<ol>
<li>Gautama, when he sat in meditation for getting new light, was
greatly in the grip of the Sankhya Philosophy.</li>
<li>That suffering and unhappiness [were] in the world, he
thought was an incontrovertible fact.</li>
<li>Gautama was, however, interested in knowing how to do away with
suffering. This problem the Sankhya Philosophy did not deal with.</li>
<li>It is, therefore, on this problem&ndash;how to remove suffering and
unhappiness&ndash;that he concentrated his mind.</li>
<li>Naturally, the first question he asked himself was&ndash;&ldquo;What are
the causes of [the] suffering and unhappiness which an individual
undergoes?&rdquo;</li>
<li>His second question was&ndash;&ldquo;How to remove unhappiness?&rdquo;</li>
<li>To both these questions he got a right answer, which is called
&lsquo;<em>Samma Bodhi</em>&rsquo; (Right Enlightenment).</li>
<li>It is because of this that the Banyan Tree has come to be known
as the Bodhi Tree.</li>

<p>§ 4. Gautama who was a Bodhisatta, After Sammabodhi Becomes a Buddha</p>
<ol>
<li>Before enlightenment Gautama was only a Bodhisatta. It is after
reaching enlightenment that he became a Buddha.</li>
<li>Who and what is a Bodhisatta?</li>
<li>A Bodhisatta is a person who is seeking to be a Buddha.</li>
<li>How does a Bodhisatta become a Buddha?</li>
<li>A Bodhisatta must be a Bodhisatta for ten lives in succession.
What must a Bodhisatta do in order to qualify himself to become a
Buddha?</li>
<li>In his first life he acquires Mudita (joy). The Bodhisatta,
having blown off his impurities as the smith blows the dross from
silver, reflects that man who has been reckless and becomes sober
brightens up the world like the moon freed from clouds. Joy springs up
in him, realising this, and he is fervent in his desire to benefit all
beings.</li>
<li>In his second life he acquires Vimala (Purity). The Bodhisatta
has now removed all thoughts of lust; he is kind; he is kind to all;
he neither flatters the vices of men nor disparages their virtues.</li>
<li>In his third life he acquires Prabhakari (Brightness). The
intellect of the Bodhisatta now becomes as bright as a mirror. He
fully knows and grasps the truths of Anatta and Anicca. His only wish
is for the highest wisdom, and for this he is ready to sacrifice
anything.</li>
<li>In his fourth life he acquires Arcishmati (Intelligence of
Fire). The Bodhisatta in this life fixes his mind on the Eightfold
Path, the Four Contemplations, the Fourfold Contest, the Fourfold Will
Power, the Fivefold Morality.</li>
<li>In his fifth life he acquires Sudurjaya (Difficult to
Conquer). He fully understands the connection of the relative and the
absolute.</li>
<li>In his sixth life he becomes Abhimukhi. In this stage the
Bodhisatta is now prepared fully to grasp the evolution of things, its
cause, the Twelve Nidanas; and this knowledge, called Abhimukhi,
awakens the most profound compassion in his heart for all beings
blinded by Avidya.</li>
<li>In his seventh life the Bodhisatta becomes a Durangama (going
far off). The Bodhisatta is now beyond time and space ; he is one with
Infinity, but he still retains nama-rupa out of his great compassion
for all beings. He is secluded from others, in that the lusts of the
world no more cling to him than water to a lotus leaf. He quenches
desires in his fellow beings, practices charity, patience,
tactfulness, energy, calmness, intelligence, and the highest wisdom.</li>
<li>While in this life, he knows the Dharma, but presents it in
ways understood by the people; he knows he must be tactful and
patient. Whatever men do to him he bears with equanimity, for he knows
that it is through ignorance [that] they misunderstand his motives.
At the same time he never slackens his energy to benefit all beings,
nor does he withdraw his mind from wisdom; therefore misfortune can
never turn him from the righteous path.</li>
<li>In his eighth life he becomes Acala. In the stage of Acala, or
&lsquo;immovable,&rsquo; all strivings on the part of the Bodhisatta cease. He
follows good spontaneously; whatever he will do he will succeed in.</li>
<li>In his ninth life he becomes Sadhumati. This is the stage or
condition of one who has vanquished and penetrated all dharmas or
systems, all quarters, and does not enter time.</li>
<li>In his tenth life he becomes Dharmamegha. The Bodhisatta
attains the infinite divine eye of a Buddha.</li>
<li>The Bodhisatta acquires these ten powers which are necessary
for him when he becomes a Buddha.</li>
<li>The Bodhisatta must not only acquire these ten powers as he
evolves from stage to stage, but he must also practice to perfection
the ten Paramitas.</li>
<li>One Paramita is to be the end of one life. Specialisation in
the Paramitas must go stage by stage. One Paramita in one life and not
a little of one and a little of the other.</li>
<li>It is only when he is doubly equipped that a Bodhisatta
becomes qualified for becoming a Buddha. The Buddha is a culminating
point in the life of a Bodhisatta.</li>
<li>The theory of the Jatakas or the birth stages of a Bodhisatta
appears analogous to the Brahmanic theory of Avataras, i.e., the
theory of incarnations of God.</li>
<li>The Jataka theory is based upon the Buddha having the highest
degree of purity as the essence of his being.</li>
<li>The Avatar theory does not require that the God should be pure
in his making. All that the Brahmanic theory of Avatar says is that
God saves his followers by taking different forms although the God may
be very impure and immoral in his conduct.</li>
<li>The theory that to be a Bodhisatta for ten lives as a
condition precedent for becoming a Buddha has no parallel anywhere. No
other religion calls upon its founder to answer such a test.</li>

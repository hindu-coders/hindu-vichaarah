  <p><em>(A Reprint of his Articles in the &quot; Harijan &ldquo;)</em></p>
<h2 id="dr-ambedkars-indictment-i"><strong>Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s Indictment I</strong></h2>
<p>The readers will recall the fact that Dr. Ambedkar was to have presided last May at the annual conference of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal of Lahore. But the conference itself was cancelled because Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s address was found by the Reception Committee to be unacceptable. How far a Reception Committee is justified in rejecting a President of its choice because of his address that may be objectionable to it is open to question. The Committee knew Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s views on caste and the Hindu scriptures. They knew also that he had in unequivocal terms decided to give up Hinduism. Nothing less than the address that Dr. Ambedkar had prepared was to be expected from him. The committee appears to have deprived the public of an opportunity of listening to the original views of a man, who has carved out for himself a unique position in society. Whatever label he wears in future, Dr. Ambedkar is not the man to allow himself to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar was not going to be beaten by the Reception Committee. He has answered their rejection of him by publishing the address at his own expense. He has priced it at 8 annas, I would suggest a reduction to 2 annas or at least 4 annas.</p>
<p>No reformer can ignore the address. The orthodox will gain by reading it. This is not to say that the address is not open to objection. It has to be read only because it is open to serious objection. Dr. Ambedkar is a challenge to Hinduism. Brought up as a Hindu, educated by a Hindu potentate, he has become so disgusted with the so-called Savarna Hindus for the treatment that he and his people have received at their hands that he proposes to leave not only them but the very religion that is his and their common heritage. He has transferred to that religion, his disgust against a part of its professors.</p>
<p>But this is not to be wondered at. After all, one can only judge a system or an institution by the conduct of its representatives. What is more. Dr. Ambedkar found that the vast majority of Savarna Hindus had not only conducted themselves inhumanly against those of their fellow religionists, whom they classed as untouchables, but they had based their conduct on the authority of their scriptures, and when he began to search them he had found ample warrant for their beliefs in untouchability and all its implications. The author of the address has quoted chapter and verse in proof of his three-fold indictment—inhuman conduct itself, the unabashed justification for it on the part of the perpetrators, and the subsequent discovery that the justification was warranted by their scriptures.</p>
<p>No Hindu who prizes his faith above life itself can afford to underrate the importance of this indictment. Dr Ambedkar is not alone in his disgust He is its most uncompromising exponent and one of the ablest among them. He is certainly the most irreconcilable among them. Thank God, in the front rank of the leaders, he is singularly alone and as yet but a representative of a very small minority. But what he says is voiced with more or less vehemence by many leaders belonging to the depressed classes. Only the latter, for instance Rao Bahadur M. C. Rajah and Dewan Bahadur Srinivasan, not only do not threaten to give up Hinduism but find enough warmth in it to compensate for the shameful persecution to which the vast mass of Harijans are exposed.</p>
<p>But the fact of many leaders remaining in the Hindu fold is no warrant for disregarding what Dr. Ambedkar has to say. The Savaraas have to correct their belief and their conduct. Above all those who are by their learning and influence among the Savarnas have to give an authoritative interpretation of the scriptures. The questions that Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s indictment suggest are :</p>
<p>(1) What are the scriptures ?</p>
<p>(2) Are all the printed texts to be regarded as an integral part of them or is any part of them to be rejected as unauthorised interpolation ?</p>
<p>(3) What is the answer of such accepted and expurgated scriptures on the question of untouchability, caste, equality of status, inter-dining and intermarriages ? (These have been all examined by Dr. Ambedkar in his address.)</p>
<p>I must reserve for the next issue my own answer to these questions and a statement of the (at least some) manifest flaws in Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s thesis</p>
<p><em>(Harijan,</em> July II, 1936)</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>The <em>Vedas, Upanishads, Smritis</em> and <em>Puranas</em> including Ramayana and Mahabharata are the Hindu Scriptures. Nor is this a finite list. Every age or even. generation has added to the list. It follows, therefore, that everything printed or even found handwritten is not scripture. The <em>Smri__ties</em> for instance-contain much that can never be accepted as the word of God. Thus. many of the texts that Dr. Ambedkar quotes from the <em>Smritis</em> cannot be accepted as authentic. The scriptures, properly so-called, can only be concerned with eternal varieties and must appeal to any conscience <em>i.e.</em> any heart whose eyes of understanding are opened. Nothing can be accepted as the word of God which cannot be tested by reason or be capable of being spiritually experienced. And even when you have an expurgated edition of the scriptures, you will need their interpretation. Who is the best interpreter? Not learned men surely. Learning there must be. But religion does not live it. It lives in the experiences of its saints and seers, in their lives and sayings. When all the most learned commentators of the scriptures are utterly forgotten, the accumulated experience of the sages and saints will abide and be an inspiration for ages to come.</p>
<p>Caste has nothing to do with religion. It is a custom whose origin I do not know and do not need to know for the satisfaction of my spiritual hunger. But I do know that it is harmful both to spiritual and national growth. <em>Varna</em> and <em>Ashrama</em> are institutions which have nothing to do with castes .The law of <em>Varna</em> teaches us that we have each one of us to earn our bread by following the ancestral calling. it defines not our rights but our duties. It necessarily has reference to callings that are conducive to the welfare of humanity and to no other. It also follows that there is no calling too low and none too high. Ail are good, lawful and absolutely equal in status. The callings of a Brahmin— spiritual teacher—-and a scavenger are equal, and their due performance carries equal merit before God and at one time seems to have carried identical reward before man. Both were entitled to their livelihood and no more. Indeed one traces even now in the villages the faint lines of this healthy operation of the law. Living in Segaon with its population of 600, I do not find a great disparity between the earnings of different tradesmen including Brahmins. I find too that real Brahmins are to be found even in these degenerate days who are living on alms freely given to them and are giving freely of what they have of spiritual treasures. It would be wrong and improper to judge the law of <em>Varna</em> by its caricature in the lives of men who profess to belong to a <em>Varna,</em> whilst they openly commit a breach of its only operative rule. Arrogation of a superior status by and of the <em>Varna</em> over another is a denial of the law. And there is nothing in the law of <em>Varna</em> to warrant a belief in untouchability. (The essence of Hinduism is contained in its enunciation of one and only God as Truth and its bold acceptance of Ahimsa as the law of the human family.)</p>
<p>I am aware that my interpretation of Hinduism will be disputed by many besides Dr. Ambedkar. That does not affect my position. It is an interpretation by which I have lived for nearly half a century and according to which I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to regulate my life.</p>
<p>In my opinion the profound mistake that Dr. Ambedkar has made in his address is to pick out the texts of doubtful authenticity and value and the state of degraded Hindus who are no fit specimens of the faith they so woefully misrepresent. Judged by the standard applied by Dr. Ambedkar, every known living faith will probably fail.</p>
<p>In his able address, the learned Doctor has over proved his case. Can a religion that was professed by Chaitanya, Jnyandeo, Tukaram, Tiruvailuvar, Rarnkrishna Paramahansa, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Maharshi Devendranath Tagore, Vivekanand and host of others who might be easily mentioned, so utterly devoid of merit as is made out in Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s address ? A religion has to be judged not by it&rsquo;s worst specimens but by the best it might have produced. For that and that alone can be used as the standard to aspire to, if not to improve upon. <em>(Harijan,</em> July 18, 1936)</p>
<h2 id="iii-varna-versus-caste">III <strong>VARNA VERSUS CASTE</strong></h2>
<p>Shri Sant Ramji of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal of Lahore wants me to publish the following: &quot; I have read your remarks about Dr. Ambedkar and the Jat-Pat-Todak</p>
<p>Mandal, Lahore. In that connection I beg to submit as follows :</p>
<p>&quot; We did not invite  Dr. Ambedkar to preside over our conference because he belonged to the Depressed Classes, for we do not distinguish between a touchable and an untouchable Hindu. On the contrary our choice fell on him simply because his diagnosis of the fatal disease of the Hindu community was the same as ours, <em>i.e.</em> he too was of the opinion that caste system was the root cause of the disruption and downfall of the Hindus. The subject of the Doctor&rsquo;s thesis for Doctorate being caste system, he has studied the subject thoroughly. Now the object of our conference was to persuade the Hindus to annihilate castes but the advice of a non-Hindu in social and religious matters can have no effect on them. The Doctor in the supplementary portion of his address insisted on saying that that was his last speech as a Hindu, which was irrelevant as well as pernicious to the interests of the conference. So we requested him to expunge that sentence for he could easily say the same thing on any other occasion. But he refused and we saw no utility in making merely a show of our function. In spite of all this, I cannot help praising his address which is, as far as I know, the most learned thesis on the subject and worth translating into every vernacular of India.</p>
<p>Moreover, I want to bring to your notice that your philosophical difference between Caste and <em>Varna</em> is too subtle to be grasped by people in general, because for all practical purposes in the Hindu society Caste and <em>Varna</em> are one and the same thing, for the function of both of them is one and the same <em>i.e.</em> to restrict inter-caste marriages and inter-dining. Your theory of <em>Varnavyavastha</em> is impracticable in this age and there is no hope of its revival in the near future. But Hindus are slaves of caste and do not want to destroy it. So when you advocate your ideal of imaginary <em>Varnavyavastha</em> they find justification for clinging to caste. Thus you are doing a great disservice to social reform by advocating your imaginary utility of division of <em>Varnas,</em> for it creates hindrance in our way. To try to remove untouchability without striking at the root of <em>Varnavyavastha</em> is simply to treat the outward symptoms of a disease or to draw a line on the surface of water. As in the heart of their hearts <em>dvijas</em> do not want to give social equality to the so-called touchable and untouchable Shudras, so they refuse to break caste, and give liberal donations for the removal of untouchability, simply to evade the issue. To seek the help of the <em>Shastras</em> for the removal of untouchability and caste is simply to wash mud with mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the letter surely cancels the first. If the Mandal rejects the help of the <em>Shastras,</em> they do exactly what Dr. Ambedkar does, <em>i.e.</em> cease to be Hindus. How then can they object to Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s address merely because he said that that was his last speech as a Hindu ? The position appears to be wholly untenable especially when the Mandal, for which Shri Sant Ram claims to speak, applauds the whole argument of Dr. Ambedkar&rsquo;s address.</p>
<p>But it is pertinent to ask what the Mandal believes if it rejects the <em>Shastras.</em> How can a Muslim remain one if he rejects the Quran ,or a Christian remain Christian if he rejects the Bible ? If Caste and <em>Varna</em> are convertible terms and if <em>Varna</em> is an integral part of the <em>Shastras</em> which define Hinduism, I do not know how a person who rejects Caste <em>i.e. Varna</em> can call himself a Hindu.</p>
<p>Shri Sant Ram likens the <em>Shastras</em> to mud. Dr. Ambedkar has not, so far as I remember, given any such picturesque name to the <em>Shastras.</em> I have certainly meant when I have said that if <em>Shastras</em> support the existing untouchability I should cease to call myself a Hindu. Similarly, if the <em>Shastras</em> support caste as we know it today in all its hideousness, I may not call myself or remain a Hindu since I have no scruples about interdining or intermarriage. I need not repeat my position regarding <em>Shastras</em> and their interpretation. I venture to suggest to Shri Sant Ram that it is the only rational and correct and morally defensible position and it has ample warrant in Hindu tradition.</p>

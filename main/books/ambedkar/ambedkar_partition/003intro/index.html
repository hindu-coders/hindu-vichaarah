<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Muslim League&rsquo;s Resolution on Pakistan has called forth
different reactions. There are some who look upon it as a case of
political measles to which a people in the infancy of their conscious
unity and power are very liable. Others have taken it as a permanent
frame of the Muslim mind and not merely a passing phase and have in
consequence been greatly perturbed.</p>
<p>The question is undoubtedly controversial. The issue is vital and
there is no argument which has not been used in the controversy by one
side to silence the other. Some argue that this demand for partitioning
India into two political entities under separate national states
staggers their imagination; others are so choked with a sense of
righteous indignation at this wanton attempt to break the unity of a
country, which, it is claimed, has stood as one for centuries, that
their rage prevents them from giving expression to their thoughts.
Others think that it need not be taken seriously. They treat it as a
trifle and try to destroy it by shooting into it similes and metaphors.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t cut your head to cure your headache,&rdquo; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t cut a baby
into two because two women are engaged in fighting out a claim as to who
its mother is,&rdquo; are some of the analogies which are used to prove the
absurdity of Pakistan. In a controversy carried on the plane of pure
sentiment, there is nothing surprising if a dispassionate student finds
more stupefaction and less understanding, more heat and less light, more
ridicule and less seriousness.</p>
<p>My position in this behalf is definite, if not singular. I do not
think the demand for Pakistan is the result of mere political distemper,
which will pass away with the efflux of time. As I read the situation,
it seems to me that it is a characteristic in the biological sense of
the term, which the Muslim body politic has developed in the same manner
as an organism develops a characteristic. Whether it will survive or
not, in the process of natural selection, must depend upon the forces
that may become operative in the struggle for existence between Hindus
and Musalmans. I am not staggered by Pakistan; I am not indignant about
it; nor do I believe that it can be smashed by shooting into it similes
and metaphors. Those who believe in shooting it by similes should
remember that nonsense does not cease to be nonsense because it is put
in rhyme, and that a metaphor is no argument though it be sometimes the
gunpowder to drive one home and imbed it in memory. I believe that it
would be neither wise nor possible to reject summarily a scheme if it
has behind it the sentiment, if not the passionate support, of 90 p.c.
Muslims of India. I have no doubt that the only proper attitude to
Pakistan is to study it in all its aspects, to understand its
implications and to form an intelligent judgement about it.</p>
<p>With all this, a reader is sure to ask: Is this book on Pakistan
seasonable in the sense that one must read it, as one must eat the
fruits of the season to keep oneself in health? If it is seasonable, is
it readable? These are natural queries and an author, whose object is to
attract readers, may well make use of the introduction to meet them.</p>
<p>As to the seasonableness of the book there can be no doubt. The way
of looking at India by Indians themselves must be admitted to have
undergone a complete change during the last 20 years. Referring to India
Prof. Arnold Toynbee wrote in 1915—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;British statesmanship in the nineteenth century regarded India as a
&lsquo;Sleeping Beauty,&rsquo; whom Britain had a prescriptive right to woo when
she awoke; so it hedged with thorns the garden where she lay, to
safeguard her from marauders prowling in the desert without. Now the
princess is awake, and is claiming the right to dispose of her own
hand, while the marauders have transformed themselves into respectable
gentlemen diligently occupied in turning the desert into a garden too,
but grievously impeded by the British thorn-hedge. When they politely
request us to remove it, we shall do well to consent, for they will
not make the demand till they feel themselves strong enough to enforce
it, and in the tussle that will follow if we refuse, the sympathies of
the Indian princess will not be on our side. Now that she is awake,
she wishes to walk abroad among her neighbours; she feels herself
capable of rebuffing without our countenance any blandishments or
threats they may offer her, and she is becoming as weary as they of
the thorn-hedge that confines her to her garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we treat her with tact, India will never wish to secede from the
spiritual brotherhood of the British Empire, but it is inevitable that
she should lead a more and more independent life of her own, and
follow the example of Anglo-Saxon Commowealths by establishing direct
relations with her neighbours. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the writer is an Englishman, the view expressed by him in
1915 was the view commonly held by all Indians irrespective of caste or
creed. Now that India the &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&rdquo; of Prof. Toynbee is awake,
what is the view of the Indians about her? On this question, there can
be no manner of doubt that those who have observed this Sleeping Beauty
behave in recent years, feel she is a strange being quite different from
the angelic princess that she was supposed to be. She is a mad maiden
having a dual personality, half human, half animal, always in
convulsions because of her two natures in perpetual conflict. If there
is any doubt about her dual personality, it has now been dispelled by
the Resolution of the Muslim League demanding the cutting up of India
into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, so that these conflicts and
convulsions due to a dual personality having been bound in one may cease
forever, and so freed from each other, may dwell in separate homes
congenial to their respective cultures, Hindu and Muslim.</p>
<p>It is beyond question that Pakistan is a scheme which will have to
be taken into account. The Muslims will insist upon the scheme being
considered. The British will insist upon some kind of settlement being
reached between the Hindus and the Muslims before they consent to any
devolution of political power. There is no use blaming the British for
insisting upon such a settlement as a condition precedent to the
transfer of power. The British cannot consent to settle power upon an
aggressive Hindu majority and make it its heir, leaving it to deal with
the minorities at its sweet pleasure. That would not be ending
imperialism. It would be creating another imperialism. The Hindus,
therefore, cannot avoid coming to grips with Pakistan, much as they
would like to do.</p>
<p>If the scheme of Pakistan has to be considered, and there is no
escape from it, then there are certain points which must be borne in
mind.</p>
<p>The first point to note is that the Hindus and Muslims must decide
the question themselves. They cannot invoke the aid of anyone else.
Certainly, they cannot expect the British to decide it for them. From
the point of view of the Empire, it matters very little to the British
whether India remains one undivided whole, or is partitioned into two
parts, Pakistan and Hindustan, or into twenty linguistic fragments as
planned by the Congress, so long as all of them are content to live
within the Empire. The British need not interfere for the simple reason
that they are not affected by such territorial divisions.</p>
<p>Further, if the Hindus are hoping that the British will use force to
put down Pakistan, that is impossible. In the first place, coercion is
no remedy. The futility of force and resistance was pointed out by Burke
long ago in his speeches relating to the coercion of the American
colonies. His memorable words may be quoted not only for the benefit of
the Hindu Maha Sabha but also for the benefit of all. This is what he
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The use of force alone is temporary. It may endure a moment but it
does not remove the necessity of subduing again: a nation is not
governed which is perpetually to be conquered. The next objection to
force is its uncertainty. Terror is not always the effect of force,
and an armament is not a victory. If you do not succeed you are
without resource; for conciliation failing, force remains; but force
failing, no further hope of reconciliation is left. Power and
Authority are sometimes bought by kindness, but they can never be
begged as alms by an impoverished and defeated violence. A further
objection to force is that you impair the object by your very
endeavours to preserve it. The thing you fought for (to wit the
loyalty of the people) is not the thing you recover, but depreciated,
sunk, wasted and consumed in the contest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coercion, as an alternative to Pakistan, is therefore unthinkable.</p>
<p>Again, the Muslims cannot be deprived of the benefit of the
principle of self-determination. The Hindu Nationalists who rely on
self-determination and ask how Britain can refuse India what the
conscience of the world has conceded to the smallest of the European
nations, cannot in the same breath ask the British to deny it to other
minorities. The Hindu Nationalist who hopes that Britain will coerce the
Muslims into abandoning Pakistan, forgets that the right of nationalism
to freedom from an aggressive foreign imperialism and the right of a
minority to freedom from an aggressive majority&rsquo;s nationalism are not
two different things; nor does the former stand on a more sacred footing
than the latter. They are merely two aspects of the struggle for freedom
and as such equal in their moral import. Nationalists, fighting for
freedom from aggressive imperialism, cannot well ask the help of the
British imperialists to thwart the right of a minority to freedom from
the nationalism of an aggressive majority. The matter must, therefore,
be decided upon by the Muslims and the Hindus alone. The British cannot
decide the issue for them. This is the first important point to note.</p>
<p>The essence of Pakistan is the opposition to the establishment of
one Central Government having supremacy over the whole of India.
Pakistan contemplates two Central Governments, one for Pakistan and the
other for Hindustan. This gives rise to the second important point which
Indians must take note of. That point is that the issue of Pakistan
shall have to be decided upon before the plans for a new constitution
are drawn and its foundations are laid. If there is to be one Central
Government for India, the design of the constitutional structure would
be different from what it would be if there is to be one Central
Government for Hindustan and another for Pakistan. That being so, it
will be most unwise to postpone the decision. Either the scheme should
be abandoned and another substituted by mutual agreement or it should be
decided upon. It will be the greatest folly to suppose that if Pakistan
is buried for the moment, it will never raise its head again. I am sure,
burying Pakistan is not the same thing as burying the ghost of Pakistan.
So long as the hostility to one Central Government for India, which is
the ideology underlying Pakistan, persists, the ghost of Pakistan will
be there, casting its ominous shadow upon the political future of India.
Neither will it be prudent to make some kind of a make-shift arrangement
for the time being, leaving the permanent solution to some future day.
To do so would be something like curing the symptoms without removing
the disease. But, as often happens in such cases, the disease is driven
in, thereby making certain its recurrence, perhaps in a more virulent
form.</p>
<p>I feel certain that whether India should have one Central Government
is not a matter which can betaken as settled; it is a matter in issue
and although it may not be a live issue now, some day it will be.</p>
<p>The Muslims have openly declared that they do not want to have any
Central Government in India and they have given their reasons in the
most unambiguous terms. They have succeeded in bringing into being five
provinces which are predominantly Muslim in population. In these
provinces, they see the possibility of the Muslims forming a government
and they are anxious to see that the independence of the Muslim
Governments in these provinces is preserved. Actuated by these
considerations, the Central Government is an eyesore to the Muslims of
India. As they visualize the scene, they see their Muslim Provinces made
subject to a Central Government predominantly Hindu and endowed with
powers of supervision over, and even of interference in, the
administration of these Muslim Provinces. The Muslims feel that to
accept one Central Government for the whole of India is to consent to
place the Muslim Provincial Governments under a Hindu Central Government
and to see the gain secured by the creation of Muslim Provinces lost by
subjecting them to a Hindu Government at the Centre. The Muslim way of
escape from this tyranny of a Hindu Centre is to have no Central
Government in India at all.<strong><a href="#n01">/1/</a></strong></p>
<p>Are the Musalmans alone opposed to the existence of a Central
Government? What about the Hindus? There seems to be a silent premise
underlying all political discussions that are going on among the Hindus
that there will always be in India a Central Government as a permanent
part of her political constitution. How far such a premise can be taken
for granted is more than I can say. I may, however, point out that there
are two factors which are dormant for the present but which some day may
become dominant and turn the Hindus away from the idea of a Central
Government.</p>
<p>The first is the cultural antipathy between the Hindu Provinces. The
Hindu Provinces are by no means a happy family. It cannot be pretended
that the Sikhs have any tenderness for the Bengalees or the Rajputs or
the Madrasis. The Bengalee loves only himself. The Madrasi is.bound by
his own world. As to the Mahratta, who does not recall that the
Mahrattas, who set out to destroy the Muslim Empire in India, became a
menace to the rest of the Hindus whom they harassed and kept under their
yoke for nearly a century. The Hindu Provinces have no common traditions
and no interests to bind them. On the other hand, the differences of
language, race, and the conflicts of the past have been the most
powerful forces tending to divide them. It is true that the Hindus are
getting together and the spirit moving them to become one united nation
is working on them. But it must not be forgotten that they have not yet
become a nation. They are in the process of becoming a nation and before
the process is completed, there may be a setback which may destroy the
work of a whole century.</p>
<p>In the second place, there is the financial factor. It is not
sufficiently known what it costs the people of India to maintain the
Central Government and the proportionate burden each Province has to
bear.</p>
<p>The total revenue of British India comes to Rs. 194,64,17,926 per
annum. Of this sum, the amount raised by the Provincial Governments from
provincial sources, comes annually to Rs. 73,57,50,125 and that raised
by the Central Government from central sources of revenue comes to Rs.
121,06,67,801. This will show what the Central Government costs the
people of India. When one considers that the Central Government is
concerned only with maintaining peace and does not discharge any
functions which have relation to the progress of the people, it should
cause no surprise if people begin to ask whether it is necessary that
they should pay annually such an enormous price to purchase peace. In
this connection, it must be borne in mind that the people in the
provinces are literally starving and there is no source left to the
provinces to increase their revenue.</p>
<p>This burden of maintaining the Central Government, which the people
of India have to bear, is most unevenly distributed over the different
provinces. The sources of central revenues are (1) Customs, (2) Excise,
(3) Salt, (4) Currency, (5) Posts and Telegraphs, (6) Income Tax and (7)
Railways. It is not possible from the accounts published by the
Government of India to work out the distribution of the three sources of
central revenue, namely Currency, Posts and Telegraphs, and Railways.
Only the revenue raised from other sources can be worked out province by
province. The result is shown in the following table :—</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="tables/003a.html">REVENUE RAISED BY PROVINCIAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It will be seen from this table that the burden of maintaining the
Central Government is not only heavy but falls unequally upon the
different provinces. The Bombay Provincial Government raises Rs.
12,44,59,553; as against this, the Central Government raises Rs.
22,53,44,247 from Bombay. The Bengal Government raises Rs. 12,76,60,892;
as against this, the Central Government raises Rs. 23,79,01,583 from
Bengal. The Sind Government raises Rs. 3,70,29,354; as against this, the
Central Government raises Rs. 5,66,46,915 from Sind. The Assam
Government raises nearly Rs. 2 1/2 crores; but the Central Government
raises nearly Rs. 2 crores from Assam. While such is the burden of the
Central Government on these provinces, the rest of the provinces
contribute next to nothing to the Central Government. The Punjab raises
Rs. 11 crores for itself but contributes only Rs. 1 crore to the Central
Government. In the N.W.F.P. the provincial revenue is Rs. 1,80,83,548;
its total contribution to the Central Government however is only Rs.
9,28,294. U.P. raises Rs. 13 crores but contributes only Rs. 4 crores to
the Centre. Bihar collects Rs. 5 crores for itself; she gives only 1 1/2
crores to the Centre. C.P. and Berar levy a total of 4 crores and pay to
the Centre 31 lakhs.</p>
<p>This financial factor has so far passed without notice. But time may
come when even to the Hindus, who are the strongest supporters of a
Central Government in India, the financial considerations may make a
greater appeal than what purely patriotic considerations do now. So, it
is possible that some day the Muslims, for communal considerations, and
the Hindus, for financial considerations, may join hands to abolish the
Central Government.</p>
<p>If this were to happen, it is better if it happens before the
foundation of a new constitution is laid down. If it happens after the
foundation of the new constitution envisaging one Central Government
were laid down, it would be the greatest disaster. Out of the general
wreck, not only India as an entity will vanish, but it will not be
possible to save even the Hindu unity. As I have pointed out, there is
not much cement even among the Hindu Provinces, and once that little
cement which exists is lost, there will be nothing with which to build
up even the unity of the Hindu Provinces. It is because of this that
Indians must decide, before preparing the plans and laying the
foundations, for whom the constitutional structure is to be raised and
whether it is temporary or permanent. After the structure is built as
one whole, on one single foundation, with girders running through from
one end to the other; if, thereafter, a part is to be severed from the
rest, the knocking out of the rivets will shake the whole building and
produce cracks in other parts of the structure which are intended to
remain as one whole. The danger of cracks is greater, if the cement
which binds them is, as in the case of India, of a poor quality. If the
new constitution is designed for India as one whole and a structure is
raised on that basis, and thereafter the question of separation of
Pakistan from Hindustan is raised and the Hindus have to yield, the
alterations that may become necessary to give effect to this severance
may bring about the collapse of the whole structure. The desire of the
Muslim Provinces may easily infect the Hindu Provinces and the spirit of
disruption generated by the Muslim Provinces may cause all round
disintegration.</p>
<p>History is not wanting in instances of constitutions threatened with
disruption. There is the instance of the Southern States of the American
Union. Natal has always been anxious to get out from the Union of South
Africa and Western Australia recently applied, though unsuccessfully, to
secede from the Australian Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In these cases actual disruption has not taken place and where it
did, it was soon healed. Indians, however, cannot hope to be so
fortunate. Theirs may be the fate of Czechoslovakia. In the first place,
it would be futile to entertain the hope that if a disruption of the
Indian constitution took place by the Muslim Provinces separating from
the Hindu Provinces, it would be possible to win back the seceding
provinces as was done in the U.S.A. after the Civil War. Secondly, if
the new Indian constitution is a Dominion Constitution, even the British
may find themselves powerless to save the constitution from such a
disruption, if it takes place after its foundations are laid. It seems
to be, therefore, imperative that the issue of Pakistan should be
decided upon before the new constitution is devised.</p>
<p>If there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a scheme which Indians
will have to resolve upon at the next revision of the constitution and
if there is no escape from deciding upon it, then it would be a fatal
mistake for the people to approach it without a proper understanding of
the question. The ignorance of some of the Indian delegates to the Round
Table Conference of constitutional law, I remember, led Mr. Garvin of
the <strong>Observer</strong> to remark that it would have been much better if the
Simon Commission, instead of writing a report on India, had made a
report on constitutional problems of India and how they were met by the
constitutions of the different countries of the world. Such a report I
know was prepared for the use of the delegates who framed the
constitution of South Africa. This is an attempt to make good that
deficiency and as such I believe it will be welcomed as a seasonable
piece.</p>
<p>So much for the question whether the book is seasonable. As to the
second question, whether the book is readable no writer can forget the
words of Augustine Birrell when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cooks, warriors, and authors must be judged by the effects they
produce; toothsome dishes, glorious victories, pleasant books, these
are our demands. We have nothing to do with ingredients, tactics, or
methods. We have no desire to be admitted into the kitchen, the
council, or the study. The cook may use her saucepans how she pleases,
the warrior place his men as he likes, the author handle his material
or weave his plot as best he can; when the dish is served we only ask.
Is it good?; when the battle has been fought, Who won?; when the book
comes out, Does it read?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Authors ought not to be above being reminded that it is their first
duty to write agreeably. Some very disagreeable men have succeeded in
doing so, and there is, therefore, no need for anyone to despair.
Every author, be he grave or gay, should try to make his book as
ingratiating as possible. Reading is not a duty, and has consequently
no business to be made disagreeable. Nobody is under any obligation to
read any other man&rsquo;s book.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am fully aware of this. But I am not worried about it. That may
well apply to other books but not to a book on Pakistan. Every Indian
must read a book on Pakistan, if not this, then some other, if he wants
to help his country to steer a clear path.</p>
<p>If the book does not read well, i.e., its taste be not good, the
reader will find two things in it which, I am sure, are good.</p>
<p>The first thing he will find is that the ingredients are good. There
is in the book material which will be helpful and to gain access to
which he will have to labour a great deal. Indeed, the reader will find
that the book contains an epitome of India&rsquo;s political and social
history during the last twenty years, which it is necessary for every
Indian to know.</p>
<p>The second thing he will find is that there is no partisanship. The
aim is to expound the scheme of Pakistan in all its aspects and not to
advocate it. The aim is to explain and not to convert. It would,
however, be a pretence to say that I have no views on Pakistan. Views I
have. Some of them are expressed, others may have to be gathered. Two
things, however, may well be said about my views. In the first place,
wherever they are expressed, they have been reasoned out. Secondly,
whatever the views, they have certainly not the fixity of a popular
prejudice. They are really thoughts and not views. In other words, I
have an open mind, though not an empty mind. A person with an open mind
is always the subject of congratulations. While this may be so, it must,
at the same time, be realized that an open mind may also be an empty
mind and that such an open mind, if it is a happy condition, is also a
very dangerous condition for a man to be in. A disaster may easily
overtake a man with an empty mind. Such a person is like a ship without
ballast and without a rudder. It can have no direction. It may float but
may also suffer a shipwreck against a rock for want of direction. While
aiming to help the reader by placing before him all the material,
relevant and important, the reader will find that I have not sought to
impose my views on him. I have placed before him both sides of the
question and have left him to form his own opinion.</p>
<p>The reader may complain that I have been provocative in stating the
relevant facts. I am conscious that .such a charge may be levelled
against me. I apologize freely and gladly for the same. My excuse is
that I have no intention to hurt. I had only one purpose, that is, to
force the attention of the indifferent and casual reader to the issue
that is dealt with in the book. I ask the reader to put aside any
irritation that he may feel with me and concentrate his thoughts on this
tremendous issu : Which is to be, Pakistan or no Pakistan?</p>

Muslim Case for Pakistan</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>WHAT DOES THE LEAGUE DEMAND?</p>
<p>I<br>
[The Muslim League&rsquo;s Resolution of March 1940]</p>
<p>On the 26th of March 1940, Hindu India was startled to attention as
it had never been before. On that day, the Muslim League at its Lahore
Session passed the following Resolution :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;1. While approving and endorsing the action taken by the Council
and the Working Committee of the All-India Muslim League as indicated
in their resolutions dated the 27th of August, 17th and 18th of
September and 22nd of October 1939 and 3rd of February 1940 on the
constitutional issue, this Session of the All-India Muslim League
emphatically reiterates that the Scheme of Federation embodied in the
Government of India Act, 1935, is totally unsuited to, and unworkable
in the peculiar conditions of this country and is altogether
unacceptable to Muslim India;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. It further records its emphatic view that while the
declaration dated the 18th of October 1939 made by the Viceroy on
behalf of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government is reassuring in as far as it
declares that the policy and plan on which the Government of India
Act, 1935, is based will be reconsidered in consultation with the
various parties, interests and communities in India, Muslim India
will not be satisfied unless the whole constitutional plan is
reconsidered <em>de novo</em> and that no revised plan would be acceptable to
the Muslims, unless it is framed with their approval and consent;</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Resolved that it is the considered view of this Session of
the All-India Muslim League that no constitutional plan would be
workable in this country or acceptable to the Muslims unless it is
designated on the following basic principle, viz. that geographically
contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should be so
constituted with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary,
that the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority as
in the North-Western and Eastern Zones of India should be grouped to
constitute &ldquo;Independent States&rdquo; in which the Constituent Units shall
be autonomous and sovereign;</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. That adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards should be
specifically provided in the constitution for minorities in these
units and in the regions for the protection of their religious,
cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights, and
interests in consultation with them; and in other parts of India where
the Musalmans are in a minority, adequate, effective and mandatory
safeguards shall be specifically provided in the constitution for
them and other minorities for the protection of their religious,
cultural, economic, political, administrative and other rights, and
interests in consultation with them;</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. This Session further authorizes the Working Committee to
frame a Scheme of Constitution in accordance with these basic
principles, providing for the assumption finally by the respective
regions of all powers such as defence, external affairs,
communication, customs, and such other matters as may be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this Resolution contemplate? A reference to paragraph 3 of
the Resolution will show that the Resolution contemplates that the areas
in which Muslims predominate shall be incorporated into independent
States. In concrete terms, it means that the Punjab, the North-Western
Frontier Province, Baluchistan and Sind in the North-West and Bengal in
the East instead of remaining as the provinces of British India shall be
incorporated as independent States outside of British India. This is the
sum and substance of the Resolution of the Muslim League.</p>
<p>Does the Resolution contemplate that these Muslim provinces, after
being incorporated into States, will remain each an independent
sovereign State or will they be joined together into one constitution as
members of a single State, federal or unitary? On this point, the
Resolution is rather ambiguous, if not self-contradictory. It speaks of
grouping the zones into &ldquo;Independent States in which the Constituent
Units shall be autonomous and sovereign.&rdquo; The use of the term
&ldquo;Constituent Units&rdquo; indicates that what is contemplated is a Federation.
If that is so, then, the use of the word &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; as an attribute of
the Units is out of place. Federation of Units and sovereignty of Units
are contradictions. It may be that what is contemplated is a
confederation. It is, however, not very material for the moment whether
these Independent States are to form into a federation or a
confederation. What is important is the basic demand, namely, that these
areas are to be separated from India and formed into Independent States.</p>
<p>The Resolution is so worded as to give the idea that the scheme
adumbrated in it is a new one. But, there can be no doubt that the
Resolution merely resuscitates a scheme which was put forth by Sir
Mahomed Iqbal in his Presidential address to the Muslim League at its
Annual Session held at Lucknow in December 1930. The scheme was not then
adopted by the League. It was, however, taken up by one Mr. Rehmat Ali
who gave it the name, Pakistan, by which it is known. Mr. Rehmat Ali, M.
A., LL.B., founded the Pakistan Movement in 1933. He divided India into
two, namely, Pakistan and Hindustan. His Pakistan included the Punjab,
N. W. F. Province, Kashmir, Sind and Baluchistan. The rest to him was
Hindustan. His idea was to have an &ldquo;independent and separate Pakistan&rdquo;
composed of five Muslim provinces in the North as an independent State.
The proposal was circulated to the members of the Round Table Conference
but never officially put forth. It seems an attempt was made privately
to obtain the assent of the British Government, who, however, declined
to consider it because they thought that this was a &ldquo;revival of the old
Muslim Empire.&quot;<strong><a href="#n01">/1/</a></strong></p>
<p>The League has only enlarged the original scheme of Pakistan. It has
sought to create one more Muslim State in the East to include the
Muslims in Bengal and Assam. Barring this, it expresses in its essence
and general outline the scheme put forth by Sir Mahomed Iqbal and
propagated by Mr. Rehmat Ali. There is no name given to this new Muslim
State in the East. This has made no difference in the theory and the
issues involved in the ideology of Mr. Rehmat Ali. The only difficulty
one feels is that the League, while enlarging the facets, has not
christened the two Muslim States with short and sweet names as it might
have been expected to do. That it did not do and we are left to carry on
the discussion with two long jaw-breaking names of Muslim State in the
West and Muslim State in the East. I propose to solve this difficulty by
reserving the name Pakistan to express the ideology underlying the
two-nation theory and its consequent effect, namely, partition, and by
designating the two Muslim States in the North-West and North-East as
Western Pakistan and Eastern Pakistan.</p>
<p>The scheme not only called Hindu India to attention but it shocked
Hindu India. Now it is natural to ask, what is there that is new or
shocking in this scheme?</p>
<p>II<br>
[Unifying the North-West provinces is an age-old project]</p>
<p>Is the idea of linking up of the provinces in the North-West a
shocking idea? If so, let it be remembered that the linking of these
provinces is an age-old project put forth by successive Viceroys,
Administrators and Generals. Of the Pakistan provinces in the
North-West, the Punjab and N. W. F. P. constituted a single province
ever since the Punjab was conquered by the British in 1849. The two
continued to be a single province till 1901. It was in 1901 that Lord
Curzon broke up their unity and created the present two provinces. As to
the linking up of the Punjab with Sind, there can be no doubt that had
the conquest of Sind followed and not preceded the conquest of the
Punjab, Sind would have been incorporated into the Punjab, for the two
are not only contiguous but are connected by a single river which is the
most natural tie between them. Although Sind was joined to Bombay, which
in the absence of the Punjab was the only base from which it could be
governed, the idea of disconnecting Sind from Bombay and joining it to
the Punjab was not given up and projects in that behalf were put forth
from time to time. It was first put forth during the
Governor-Generalship of Lord Dalhousie; but for financial reasons, was
not sanctioned by the Court of Directors. After the mutiny, the question
was reconsidered but owing to the backward state of communications along
the Indus, Lord Canning refused to give his consent. In 1876, Lord
Northbrook was of the opinion that Sind should be joined to the Punjab.
In 1877, Lord Lytton, who succeeded Northbrook, sought to create a
trans-indus province, consisting of the six frontier districts of the
Punjab and of the transindus districts of Sind. This would have included
the six Frontier districts of the Punjab, namely, Hazara, Peshawar,
Kohat, Bannu (except the Cis-indus tracts), Dera Ismail Khan (with the
same exception), Dera Ghazi Khan, and trans-Indus Sind (with the
exception of Karachi). Lytton also proposed that Bombay should receive
the whole or part of the Central Provinces, in order to compensate it
for the loss of trans-indus Sind. These proposals were not acceptable to
the Secretary of State. During the Vice-royalty of Lord Lansdowne
(1888-94), the same project was revived in its original form, namely,
the transfer of Sind to the Punjab, but owing to the formation of the
Baluchistan Agency, Sind had ceased to be a Frontier district and the
idea which was military in its motive, lost its force and Sind remained
without being incorporated in the Punjab. Had the British not acquired
Baluchistan and had Lord Curzon not thought of carving out the N. W. F.
P. out of the Punjab, we would have witnessed long ago the creation of
Pakistan as an administrative unit.</p>
<p>With regard to the claim for the creation of a National Muslim State
in Bengal, again, there is nothing new in it. It will be recalled by
many that in 1905, the province of Bengal and Assam was divided by the
then Viceroy, Lord Curzon, into two provinces: (1) Eastern Bengal and
Assam with Dacca as its capital and (2) Western Bengal with Calcutta as
its capital. The newly-created province of Eastern Bengal and Assam
included Assam and the following districts of the old province of Bengal
and Assam: (1) Dacca, (2) Mymensingh, (3) Faridpur, (4) Backer gunge,
(5) Tippera, (6) Noakhali, (7) Chittagong, (8) Chittagong Hill Tracts,
(9) Rajashahi, (10) Dinajpur, (II) Jalpaiguri, (12) Rangpur, (13) Bogra,
(14) Pabna and (15) Malda. Western Bengal included the remaining
districts of the old Province of Bengal and Assam with the addition of
the district of Sambalpur which was transferred from C. P. to Western
Bengal.</p>
<p>This division of one province into two, which is known in Indian
history as the Partition of Bengal, was an attempt to create a Muslim
State in Eastern Bengal, inasmuch as the new province of Eastern Bengal
and Assam was, barring parts of Assam, a predominantly Muslim area. But,
the partition was abrogated in 1911 by the British who yielded to the
Hindus, who were opposed to it and did not care for the wishes of the
Muslims, as they were too weak to make themselves felt. If the partition
of Bengal had not been annulled, the Muslim State in Eastern Bengal,
instead of being a new project, would now have been 39 years
old.<strong><a href="#n02">/2/</a></strong></p>
<p>III<br>
[The Congress itself has proposed to create Linguistic Provinces]</p>
<p>Is the idea of separation of Pakistan from Hindustan shocking? If
so, let me recall a few facts which are relevant to the issue and which
form the basic principles of the Congress policy. It will be remembered
that as soon as Mr. Gandhi captured the Congress, he did two things to
popularize it. The first thing he did was to introduce Civil
Disobedience.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Gandhi &rsquo;s entry into the politics of India, the parties
contending for power were the Congress, the Liberals and the Terrorists
of Bengal. The Congress and the Liberals were really one party and there
was no distinction between them such as divides them today. We can,
therefore, safely say that there were only two parties in India, the
Liberals and the Terrorists. In both, the conditions for admission were
extremely difficult. In the Liberal Party, the condition for admission
was not merely education but a high degree of learning. Without first
establishing a reputation for study, one could never hope to obtain
admission to the Liberal Party. It effectively excluded the uneducated
from rising to political power. The Terrorists had prescribed the
hardest test conceivable. Only those who were prepared to give their
lives for the cause, not in the sense of dedicating them but in the
sense of dying for it, could become members of their organization. No
knave could, therefore, get an entry into the Terrorists&rsquo; organization.
Civil disobedience does not require learning. It does not call for the
shedding of life. It is an easy middle way for that large majority who
have no learning and who do not wish to undergo the extreme penalty and
at the same time obtain the notoriety of being patriots. It is this
middle path which made the Congress more popular than the Liberal Party
or the Terrorist Party.</p>
<p>The second thing Mr. Gandhi did was to introduce the principle of
Linguistic Provinces. In the constitution that was framed by the
Congress under the inspiration and guidance of Mr. Gandhi, India was to
be divided into the following Provinces with the language and
headquarters as given below :—</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="tables/101a.html">THE CONGRESS&rsquo;S PROPOSED LINGUISTIC PROVINCES</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In this distribution no attention was paid to considerations of
area, population or revenue. The thought that every administrative unit
must be capable of supporting and supplying a minimum standard of
civilized life, for which it must have sufficient area, sufficient
population and sufficient revenue, had no place in this scheme of
distribution of areas for provincial purposes. The determining factor
was language. No thought was given to the possibility that it might
introduce a disruptive force in the already loose structure of the
Indian social life. The scheme was, no doubt, put forth with the sole
object of winning the people to the Congress by appealing to their local
patriotism.The idea of linguistic provinces has come to stay and the
demand for giving effect to it has become so insistent and irresistible
that the Congress, when it came into power, was forced to put it into
effect. Orissa has already been separated from Bihar.<strong><a href="#n03">/3/</a></strong>
Andhra is demanding separation from Madras. Kamatak is asking for
separation from Maharashtra.<strong><a href="#n04">/4/</a></strong> The only linguistic province
that is not demanding separation from Maharashtra is Gujarat Or rather,
Gujarat has given up for the moment the idea of separation. That is
probably because Gujarat has realized that union with Maharashtra is,
politically as well as commercially, a better investment.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the fact remains that separation on linguistic
basis is now an accepted principle with the Congress. It is no use
saying that the separation of Karnatak and Andhra is based on a
linguistic difference and that the claim to separation of Pakistan is
based on a cultural difference. This is a distinction without
difference. Linguistic difference is simply another name for cultural
difference.</p>
<p>If there is nothing shocking in the separation of Karanatak and
Andhra, what is there to shock in the demand for the separation of
Pakistan? If it is disruptive in its effect, it is no more disruptive
than the separation of Hindu provinces such as Karnatak from Maharashtra
or Andhra from Madras. Pakistan is merely another manifestation of a
cultural unit demanding freedom for the growth of its own distinctive
culture.</p>

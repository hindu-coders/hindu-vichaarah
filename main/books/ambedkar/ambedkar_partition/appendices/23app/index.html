<p><strong>Government of India Resolution of 1934 on Communal Representation of
Minorities in the Services<a href="#n01">/1/</a></strong></p>
<p>the 4th July 1934</p>
<p><strong>SECTION I÷GENERAL</strong></p>
<p>No. F. 14/17-B./33.÷In accordance with undertakings given in the
Legislative Assembly the Government of India have carefully reviewed the
results of the policy followed since 1925 of reserving a certain
percentage of direct appointments to Government service for the redress
of communal inequalities. It has been represented that though this
policy was adopted mainly with the object of securing increased
representation for Muslims in the public services, it has failed to
secure for them their due share of appointments and it has been
contended that this position cannot be remedied unless a fixed
percentage of vacancies is reserved for Muslims. In particular,
attention has been drawn to the small number of Muslims in the Railway
services, even on those railways which run through areas in which
Muslims form a high percentage of the total population.</p>
<p>The review of the position has shown that these complaints are
justified, and the Government of India are satisfied by the enquiries
they have made that the instructions regarding recruitment must be
revised with a view to improving the position of Muslims in the
services.</p>
<p><strong>(2.)</strong> In considering this general question the Government of India
have also to take into account the claims of Anglo-Indians and Domiciled
Europeans and of the depressed classes. Anglo-Indians have always held a
large percentage of appointments in certain branches of the public
service and it has been recognised that, in view of the degree to which
the community has been dependent on this employment, steps must be taken
to prevent in the new conditions anything in the nature of a rapid
displacement of Anglo-Indians from their existing positions, which might
occasion a violent dislocation of the economic structure of the
community. The instructions which follow in regard to the employment of
Anglo-Indians and Domiciled Europeans in certain departments are
designed to give effect to this policy.</p>
<p><strong>(3.)</strong> In regard to the depressed classes it is common ground that all
reasonable steps should be taken to secure for them a fair degree of
representation in the public services. The intention of caste Hindus in
this respect was formally stated in the Poona Agreement of 1932 and His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government in accepting that agreement took due note of this
point. In the present state of general education in these classes the
Government of India consider that no useful purpose will be served by
reserving for them a definite percentage of vacancies out of the number
available for Hindus as a whole, but they hope to ensure that duly
qualified candidates from the depressed classes are not deprived of fair
opportunities of appointment merely because. they cannot succeed in open
competition.</p>
<p><strong>(4.)</strong> The Government of India have also considered carefully the
position of minority communities other than those mentioned above and
are satisfied that the new rules will continue to provide for them, as
at present, a reasonable degree of representation in the services.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION II÷SCOPE OF RULES</strong></p>
<p><strong>(5.)</strong> The Government of India propose to prescribe annual returns in
order to enable them to watch the observance of the rules laid down
below.</p>
<p><strong>(6.)</strong> The general rules which the Government of India have with the
approval of the Secretary of State adopted with the purpose of securing
these objects are explained below. They relate only to direct
recruitment and not to recruitment by promotion which will continue to
be made as at present solely on merit. They apply to the Indian Civil
Service, the Central Services, Class I and Class II, and the Subordinate
Services under the administrative control of the Government of India
with the exception of a few services and posts for which high technical
or special qualifications are required, but do not apply to recruitment
for these Services in the province of Burma. In. regard to the Railways,
they apply to all posts other than those of inferior servants or
labourers on the four State-managed Railways, and the administrations of
the Company-managed Railways will be asked to adopt similar rules for
the services on these Railways.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION III÷RULES FOR SERVICES RECRUITED ON AN ALL-INDIA BASIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>(7.)</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> For the Indian Civil Service and the Central and
Subordinate Services to which recruitment is made on an All-India basis,
the following rules will be observed:÷</p>

<p>(i) 25 percent of all vacancies to be filled by direct recruitment
of Indians, will be reserved for Muslims and 8 1/3 percent for other
minority communities.</p>
<p>(ii) When recruitment is made by open competition, if Muslims or the
other minority communities obtain less than these percentages, these
percentages will be secured to them by means of nomination; if,
however, Muslims obtain more than their reserved percentage in open
competition, no reduction will be made in the percentage reserved for
other minorities, while if the other minorities obtain more than their
reserved percentage in open competition, no reduction will be made in
the percentage reserved for Muslims.</p>
<p>(iii) If members of the other minority communities obtain less than
their reserved percentage in open competition and if duly qualified
candidates are not available for nomination, the residue of the 8 1/3
percent will be available for Muslims.</p>
<p>(iv) The percentage of 8 1/3 reserved for the other minorities will
not be distributed among them in any fixed proportion.</p>
<p>(v) In all cases a minimum standard of qualification will be imposed
and the reservations are subject to this condition.</p>
<p>(vi) In order to secure fair representation for the depressed
classes duly qualified members of these classes may be nominated to a
public service, even though recruitment to that service is being made
by competition. Members of these classes, if appointed by nomination,
will not count against the percentages reserved in accordance with
clause (i) above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> For the reasons given in paragraph 2 of this Resolution, the
Government of India have paid special attention to the question of
Anglo-Indians and Domiciled Europeans in the gazetted posts on the
Railways for which recruitment is made on an All-India basis. In order
to maintain approximately their present representation in these posts
the Anglo-Indian and Domiciled European community will require to obtain
about 9 percent of the total vacancies available to members of Indian
communities. The Government of India have satisfied themselves that at
present the community is obtaining by promotions to these gazetted posts
and by direct recruitment to them more than 9 percent, of these
vacancies. In these circumstances, it has been decided that no special
reservation is at present required. If and when the community is shown
to be receiving less than 9 percent of the vacancies, it will be
considered what adjustments in regard to direct recruitment may be
required to safeguard their legitimate interests.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION IV÷RULES FOR SERVICES RECRUITED LOCALLY</strong></p>
<p><strong>(8.)</strong> In the case of all services to which recruitment is made by
local areas and not on an All-India basis, e.g., subordinate posts in
the Railways, Posts and Telegraphs Department, Customs Service,
Income-tax Department, etc., the general rules prescribed above will
apply subject to the following modifications:÷</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) The total reservation for India as a whole of- 25 percent for
Muslims and of 8 1/3 percent for other minorities will be obtained by
fixing a percentage for each Railway or local area or circle having
regard to the population ratio of Muslims and other minority
communities in the area and the rules for recruitment adopted by the
local Government of the area concerned;</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of the Railways and Posts and Telegraphs Department
and Customs Service in which the Anglo-Indian and Domiciled European
community is at present principally employed special provisions
described in the next paragraph are required in order to give effect
to the policy stated in paragraph 2 above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>(9.)</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> (a) The Anglo-Indian and Domiciled European community
at present holds 8.8 percent of the subordinate posts on the Railways.
To safeguard their position 8 percent of all vacancies to be filled by
direct recruitment will be reserved for members of this community. This
total percentage will be obtained by fixing a separate percentage (i)
for each Railway having regard to the number of members of this
community at present employed, (ii) for each branch or department of the
Railway service, so as to ensure that Anglo-Indians continue to be
employed in those branches in which they are at present principally
employed, e.g., the Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering and
Traffic Departments. No posts in the higher grades of the subordinate
posts will be reserved, and promotion to these grades will be made, as
at present, solely on merit.</p>
<p>(b) The reservation of 25 percent for Muslims and 8 percent for
Anglo-Indians makes it necessary to increase the reservation of 33 1/3
percent, hitherto adopted for all minority communities, in order to
safeguard the interests of minorities other than Muslims and
Anglo-Indians. It has been decided, therefore, to reserve for them 6
percent of vacancies filled by direct recruitment, which is
approximately the percentage of posts held by members of these
communities at present. This total reservation will be obtained in the
manner prescribed in paragraph 8 (1) of this Resolution and will not be
further sub-divided among the minority communities.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> In the Posts and Telegraphs Department the same principles will
be followed as in the case of the Railways for safeguarding the
interests of the Anglo-Indian and Domiciled European community which at
present holds about 2.2 percent of all subordinate posts. It has been
ascertained that if a reservation is made for this community of 5
percent of the vacancies in the branches, departments or categories
which members of this community may reasonably be expected to enter, it
will result in securing for them a percentage equal to slightly less
than the percentage of subordinate posts which they at present hold. In
the departments or branches in which a special reservation is made for
Anglo-Indians the reservation of vacancies for other minorities will be
fixed so as to be equal approximately to the percentage of subordinate
posts at present held by them. The total reservation for Anglo-Indians
and other minority communities, other than Muslims, will in any case be
not less than 8 1/3 percent</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Anglo-Indians are at present largely employed in subordinate
posts in the Appraising Department and in the Superior Preventive
Service at the major ports. For the former department special technical
qualifications are required, and in accordance with the general
principles indicated in paragraph 6 of this Resolution it will be
excluded from the operation of these rules. In the Preventive Service
special qualifications are required, and the present system of
recruitment whereby posts are reserved for Anglo-Indians will be
maintained.</p>
<p>**ORDER.**÷Ordered that this Resolution be communicated to all Local
Governments and Administrations and the several Departments of the
Government of India, for information ( and guidance) and that it be also
published in the <strong>Gazette of India</strong>.</p>

      <description>Nation, a positive concept-What modern scholars say-Hindu child of Bharat-Community of culture, history, etc.-Hence, Hindu Nation-Non Hindus and test of nationality-Not nurture but culture counts-Call to non-Hindus-Revive spirit of assimilation-Non-Hindu in Hindu Rashtra-Basis for national integration.
DR. KESHAV BALIRAM HEDGEWAR, founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, was from his early boyhood intensely devoted to the cause of nation and was in the thick of the various movements going on at that time for the liberation of our motherland.</description>

      <description>1. TERRITORIAL NATIONALISM: ITS ROOTS Why the word &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya&amp;rsquo; - The British game - Effects of English education - History distorted-Birth of &amp;lsquo;territorial nationalism&amp;rsquo;-Its absurdity.
Much thought was devoted to the subject before the name &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&amp;rsquo; was decided upon for the organisation. A number of persons close to the Sangh were also consulted. Naturally, many suggestions were put forth, and objections raised against each name. Even the present name was confronted with the objection that if the word &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya&amp;rsquo; was adopted then its doors would have to be kept open to all other people in the country, i.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Secularists&amp;rsquo; and Hindu nationalism - Fear complex, root of &amp;lsquo;Hindu-Muslim&amp;rsquo; bhai-bhai&#39; - Story with a moral - Ingrained conviction of Hindu Nationalism - Even truth requires &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo;.
We are witnessing a strange phenomenon in our country today. The real and positive concept of Hindu Nationalism is being dubbed as communal, reactionary, narrow-minded and so on and the unscientific, reactionary and harmful theory of territorial nationalism, upheld by our present-day leaders, is paraded as &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;broad- minded&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>1. HINDU RASHTRA AND &amp;ldquo;MINORITIES&amp;rdquo; Give up notions of &amp;ldquo;religious minority&amp;rdquo;-Example of Indonesia, Turkey, etc.-Benevolent tradition of Hindu Rashtra -Examples.
The answer to the so-called problem of &amp;lsquo;religious minorities&amp;rsquo; can be found only in the historically correct, rational and positive approach of Hindu Rashtra. Otherwise, the so- called minorities are bound to become more and more hardened in their separate shells of religion and turn into a dreadful source of disruption of our body-politic.</description>

Our True National Life
 The national life of Bharat is an ancient one. The social life here has been woven round a cultural tradition imbued with common life-ideals stemming out of a common comprehensive life-philosophy.</description>

      <description>1. THE MUSLIMS Muslims after Partition-Twofold strategy: direct aggression: swelling members - our leaders policy, violence pays - The time-bomb - forgetting nothing, learning nothing - Miniature Pakistans - &amp;lsquo;National Muslims&amp;rsquo; exposed - Face Reality.
It has been the tragic lesson of the history of many a country in the world that the hostile elements within the country pose a far greater menace to national security than aggressors from outside. Unfortunately, this first lesson of national security has been the one thing, which has been consistently ignored in our country ever since the British left this land.</description>

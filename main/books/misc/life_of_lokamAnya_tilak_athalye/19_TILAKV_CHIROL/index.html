<p>From the Deccan his (Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s) influence projected far and wide. His prestige as a Brahmin of Brahmins, and as pillar of Orthodoxy, his reputation for pro-
found learning in the philosophies of the West and the East,
his trenchant style, his indefatigable activity, the glamour of
his philanthrophy, his accessibility to high and low, his many
acts of genuine kindliness, (his) personal magnetism combined to equip him more fully than any other Indian Politician for the leadership of a revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>Indian Unrest by Sir. V. ChiroL
Page 54.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late Mr. Gokhale used to describe how he was
once humourously taken to task by an Executive
Councillor for having made a seditious speech. On Mr.
Gokhale&rsquo;s denying having done so, a C. I. D. report of
his speech was produced and both Mr. Gokhale and the
Official laughed over the perversions and distortions
contained in that report. It is not given to every
public leader to be a persona grata with the Government,
nor can he expect to have that constant communication
with the highest officers which alone, can, if possible
remove such misunderstandings. If in some future
generation after the attainment of Swaraj, the historian
of this period has access to confidential reports of the
Government, he will be able to mention how hundreds
of persons had to suffer persecutions only because of
the malice or ignorance of the C. I. D. reporters. Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s record with the Government will, in particular,
shed curious light on the workings of numerous minds
bent on crushing him by hook or crook. The revela-
tions made in the correspondence, recently publish-
ed by the Mahratta, between H. H. the Maharaja of
Kolhapur on the one hand and a number of officials on
the other have startled many a publicist and have
afforded much side-light on the events which form the
subject-matter of the correspondence. In his dealings
with the Government, Mr. Tilak felt that the under-
current of the Bureaucratic mind was poisoned by
mischievous and malicious reports of his activities. But
he was powerless to contradict or convince. He pa-
tiently bore all the pricks of his position, buoyed up
by the faith, that, the day of reckoning must come,
sooner or later, and the misunderstandings that pre-
judiced the powers that be, must ultimately melt like
a mist. The publication of the &quot; Indian Unrest &quot; by
Sir Valentine Chirol, afforded Mr. Tilak the necessary
opportunity of vindicating his loyalty and proving to
the satisfaction of the world, the righteousness of his
conduct and the truth and justice of his cause. In
attacking Sir. Valentine Chirol&rsquo;s book, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
chief object was surely to show how very prejudiced was
the medium through which the Bureaucracy looked at
him; for, in truth, &quot; The Indian Unrest &quot; — so far, at
least, as it described the personality of Mr. Tilak —
was a systematic exposition of the theories contained
in the confidential papers of the Government concern-
ing Mr. Tilak.</p>
<p>Sir Valentine Chirol had been deputed in 1910 by
the  &quot; Times (London) &quot; to study whether &quot; The lull in
the storm of Indian Unrest&rdquo; indicated &quot; a gradual and
steady return to more normal and peaceful conditions &quot;
or whether &ldquo;as in other cyclonic disturbances in tro-
pical climes it merely presaged fiercer outbursts yet to
come &ldquo;; whether &quot; the blended policy of repression and
concession (had) really cowed down the forces of crimi-
nal disorder and rallied the representatives of Moderate
t)pinion to the cause of sober and constitutional pro-
gress or whether it had come too late, either permanent-
ly to arrest the former or to restore confidence and
courage to the latter*.'* This was a problem which Sir.
Valentine Chirol set himself to study; and after a long and
careful investigation he came to the conclusion that it
was almost a misnomer to speak of Indian unrest, that
it was confined only to Hindus living in the Urban
areas of Mahratta Deccan, the Cental Provinces, Bengal
and the Punjab and that with respect to such &quot; repression meant nothing more cruel than the application of
surgery to diseased growths&rdquo; &quot; and as &quot; it is impossible that we should ever concede to India the rights of
Self-Government, Sir Valentine suggested some
minor changes of policy for the permanence of the
British Rule and the well-being of India.</p>
<p>Compare the wealth and abundance of Sir Valentine
Chirol&rsquo;s materials with the poverty and littleness of his
conclusions. The truth is that he saw things through
the medium of prejudice. His method of investigation
was entirely faulty and unhistorical. He has collected</p>
<p>♦ Indian Unrest ; Page i. t Indian Unrest ; Page 325. ■</p>
<p>§ Indian Unrest ; Page 332. *</p>
<p>the strongest and the most &ldquo;objectionable &quot; passages
from the &lsquo;* Extremist &quot; newspapers all over the
country and has sought to give them an imaginary unity
of time, place and purpose. If an Indian Chirol will
follow a similar method, ransack the files of Anglo-
Indian papers and select such passages as Sir Valentine
had done, he will be able to give a picture of Anglo-
Indian mentality at which, the author of the &quot; Indian
Unrest&rdquo; would stand aghast. Fortunately, Sir Valentine
Chirol has lived to find that &quot; Self-Government &quot; for
India is the goal of British ambition.The very gro-
und on which he bases his conclusions is thus swept
away and what remains is nothing but the manifesta-
tions of Tilak-phobia. The book sought to eternally
discredit Mr. Tilak and his party in the eyes of England
and prevent the Nationalists from raising their head
again. Here, also, Sir Valentine failed and has lived to
witness his failure. To-day he must be finding that
the principles for which Mr. Tilak fought have been ac-
cepted by almost all his countrymen and if Britain
cherishes any prejudice towards the National Party,
— well, Britain will regret the attitude, some day or
other.</p>
<p>To counteract the insidious poison of Sir. Valentine
Chirols&rsquo; writings, Mr. Tilak, after having taken the
best legal advice in England and India, filed a suit
against the offending party for damages against libel
and for an injunction to restrain publication of the
defamatory matter. After a long series of preliminary
proceedings, the case came for hearing before Mr.
Justice Darling and a Special Jury on 29th January
1919, Sir John Simon, K.C., and Mr. E. F. Spence,</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL. ^*J^</p>
<p>appeared for the plaintiff and Sir Edward Carson;
assisted by two others, defended Sir V. Chirol, the
writer, and Messrs. Macmillan and Comapany, the
Publishers of the &quot; Indian Unrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak complained that Sir V. Chirol had libelled
him in six different ways. Though he had never start-
ed, nor had ever been a subscriber to any cow-pro-
tection society, he was charged with having started the
organisation as a provocative to the Mahomedans.
Though he had never organised gymnastic societies, he
was accused of having done so with the object of
developing the martial instincts of the people for
the ultimate purpose of employing force. These
gymnastic societies, have been also called &quot; Juvenile
bands of dacoits to swell the coffers of Swaraj*&rsquo; Fur-
ther, the High Court judgment (1910) in the Tai Maharaj
^se was quoted by Sir. V. Chirol as being &quot; extremely
damaging to Tilak&rsquo;s private reputation as a man of
honour or even of common honesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most important of all were the libels in connection
•with the Rand-Ayerst and the Jackson murders : —
, &quot; What Tilak could do by secret agitation and by a
rabid campaign in the Press to raise popular resentment</p>
<p>to white-heat he did The inevitable</p>
<p>consequences ensued. On June 27th, 1897 Mr.</p>
<p>Rand and Lieut. Ayerst were shot</p>
<p>down by a young Chitpawan Brahmin. No direct con-
nection has been establishmed between the crime and
Tilak.&rdquo; (Page 48 — Indian Unrest).</p>
<p>&quot; In reply to the Magistrate who asked him why he
committed the murder, Kanhere said ' I read of many
instances of oppression in the Kesari, the Rashtramat^</p>
<p>t^lS LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and the KaL and other newspaers. I think that by
killing Sahibs we people can get justice. I never got
injustice myself, nor did any one, I know of. I now
regret killing Mr. Jackson. I killed a good man care-
lessly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>** Can anything be more eloquent and convincing than
the terrible pathos of this confession ? The three
papers named by Kanhere were Tilak&rsquo;s organs. It was
no personal experience or knowledge of his that had
driven Kanhere to his frenzied deed, but the slow, per*
sistent poison dropped into his ear by the Tilak Press.
Though it was Kanhere&rsquo;s hand that struck down ' a
good man carelessly&rsquo; was not Tilak rather than
Kanhere, the real author of the murder ? It was
merely the story of the Poona murders of 1897 over
again.&rdquo; (Page 62— Indian Unrest).</p>
<p>The opening speech of Sir John Simon occupied seven
hours. The plaintiff was next called to the witness-
box and examined by Mr. Spence. When the examina-
tion-in-chief was over, up jumped Sir Edward Carson to
cross-examine Mr. Tilak. The Court was crowded to
the utmost. An idea of the tussle between Sir Edward
Carson, &quot; the leader of Ulsterite rebels &quot; and Mr. Tilak,
the &quot; the leader of Indian rebels &quot; can be had from
the following fragments of the latter&rsquo;s long and weari-
some cross-examination which he stood extremely well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you last get out of prison&rdquo;? — June, 1914.</p>
<p>&quot; Have you taken any proceedings in India to vindi-
cate your character &ldquo;? — * No &lsquo;.</p>
<p>** Why did you come all the way to England to vindi-
cate your character &ldquo;? — &lsquo;Because, the book is read all-
over the Empire and a decision of an English Court</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL 27^</p>
<p>would have greater weight and be more efEective in
stopping the circulation of the book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot; Do you remember being sentenced to six years^
transportation ?&rdquo; — ' Yes &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Do you remember what the Judge said in summing
up ?&quot;— ' Yes '</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson then read this passage in which
the Judge referred to the articles in the Kesari : —</p>
<p>*&rsquo; They are seething with sedition ; they preach
violence ; they speak of murder with approval ;
and the cowardly and atrocious act of commit-
ting murders with bombs, not only meet with
your approval, but you haul the advent of the
bomb into India as if something had come to
India for its good.&rdquo;
Did the Judge say that ?&quot;— ' Yes \
Was that the reason why you took no proceedings
in India to vindicate your character ?&rdquo; * No *.</p>
<p>*&rsquo; Can you point to any passage in Sir Valentine
Chirol&rsquo;s book which is more severe than that ?&rdquo; — * I
complain of being associated with murder &lsquo;.</p>
<p>The plaintiff was asked to read a passage in which
one of the men who were concerned with the murder of
Mr. Jackson in 1909 said his mind was influenced by a
certain book. The plaintiff said that the book was re-
viewed in the Kesari. He did not write the review him-
self. The book was a life of Mazzini and a translation
in Marathi was dedicated to him. Many people dedi-
cated books to him without his knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot; Do you see that the murderer says that it was by
reading that book, that his mind was prepared for the
murder ?'* * He may have said that *.</p>
<p>«80 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that he committed a murder ?&rdquo; — ' I
heard that he had committed a murder. I don&rsquo;t know«
I was in jail &lsquo;*</p>
<p>&quot; Do you call it murder ?&rdquo; — ' I should certainly call
it murder/</p>
<p>&quot; Did you not advocate resistance to the law ?&quot;—
Mf you don&rsquo;t like a law, you must resist it in order to
get it altered. The penalty for resistance is punish-
ment. That is called Passive Resistancre &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson read extracts from the plaintifE&rsquo;s
newspaper Kesari and asked whether it was true that
resistance to the Government was advocated. —
' No ; it was resistance to the Government Officials ; I
draw a distinction between them &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;* Government consists of Officials, doesn&rsquo;t it ?&rdquo; —
A house consists of rooms but a room does not mean
a house &lsquo;. (Laughter).</p>
<p>&quot; Was not Mr. Kingsford the man whom it was in-
tended to kill, when two ladies with their coachman
were murdered ?&rdquo; — ' Yes, I believe so &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Extracts were read to show that the plaintiff&rsquo;s news-
paper Kesari had used language which was likely to
produce such a result. The witness denied it. He
added that the newspaper was not even printed in the
language spoken by the people where the murders were
done and his newspaper did not circulate in that part
of India.</p>
<p>L^;Sir Edward Carson read further extracts with a view
to show that the witness&rsquo;s newspaper encouraged the
use of the bomb to bring about alterations in the system
and administration of Government. The witness denied
the inference. ;i</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL 281</p>
<p>t&lt;</p>
<p>The Times of India has said that your newspaper
ibrought about the murder of Mr. Rand.&rdquo; Hadn&rsquo;t
it ?'*— ' Yes &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;* Why didn&rsquo;t you bring action against the news-
paper ?&rdquo; — ' I went to Bombay for the purpose but I was
arrested on the same day, so I couldn&rsquo;t do anything &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Why did you not take proceedings when you came
out of prison ?&rdquo; — * I did and received an apology from
the paper &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson read from a leading article in the
Kesari dated June 21st, 1908, on which he relied partly
to establish the plea of justification and asked the
witness whether the article did not encourage the use of
bombs. The witness denied this and said that the
article merely pointed to the inevitable result of mis-
government. On Sir Edward Carson reading further
extracts, the witness denied that these passages con-
tained any incitement. He said that he was explain-
ing the conditions under which bomb outrages were
likely to occur. He was simply setting forth the se-
sequence of events and warning both the bomb-throw-
ers and the officials of the danger of the situation. In
course of his rephes the witess illustrated his point by
mentioning the situation in Ulster.</p>
<p>&quot; Ulster can take care of itself. You won&rsquo;t gain
anything by introducing personal matters.&rdquo; — ' It is no
more a personal matter than the case of Russia is &lsquo;.</p>
<p>At a later stage replying to His Lordship the witness
said there were some 200 races including castes in India
professing five different religions. He did not want
any one race or religion to be dominant. He wanted a
democracy for all.</p>
<p>282 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>His Lordship : — &quot; Supposing there was an oppressed
minority under Swaraj, would they be right in throwing
bombs V* — * No man has a right to throw bombs \</p>
<p>&lsquo;* Was it your opinion that it was the oppression of
the administration of Mr. Rand during the Plague in
Poona that led to his murder?&rdquo; — &lsquo;I think that the
measures adopted and their harshness led to the mur-
der &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Did you say in your newspaper that in the search of
the houses, great tyranny was practised by the sol-
diers ?&quot;— ' I did \</p>
<p>&quot; Did you say that they entered the temple,s brought
out the women from their houses, broke idols and
burnt holy books ?&rdquo; — *I mentioned these facts. They
are facts &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Was it your opinion that Mr. Rand was more than
a tyrant ?&rdquo; — ■&rsquo; I said that his measures were tyranni-
cal &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Did you say that he was guilty of callous cruelty T*
Yes.</p>
<p>Yet you say that your writings had nothing to do
with his murder ?&rdquo; — ' The facts, not my doctrines led
to the murder &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Later, Sir Edward Carson quoted a passage, which
said that death cannot be avoided. He asked the
meaning of that. The witness said that it was a quo-
tation from a:reUgious book. It meant you are mortal.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Darling : — &quot; What was the best thing
Shivaji ever did ?&rdquo; — ' He founded the Hindu Empire \</p>
<p>&quot; Did he do it by kiUing Afzulkhan ?&quot;— * That was
one of the acts &lsquo;.</p>
<p>** Could he have done it without ?&rdquo; — ' I can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>t€</p>
<p>((</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL 28$</p>
<p>that. Supposing we have a festival of Cromwell here,
that does not mean we go on killing kings of England &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Turning to the report of a speech delivered by Mr.
Tilak at the Shivaji festival in 1897, Sir Edward Carson,
asked the witness what he meant by saying that great
men are above the common principles of morality. The
witness said that every day morality could not be ap-
plied to the superman.</p>
<p>*&rsquo; Do you apply that doctrine to the Kaiser ?&rdquo; — ' No.
He was moved by an ambition to rule the whole world,
which was wrong &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Asked to explain why an article in the form of an ex-
hortation by Shivaji, had the Bhavani sword-mark ap-
pended to it, the witness said Shivaji could not write
and was accustomed to make his mark in the form of a
sword.</p>
<p>His Lordship : — &quot; It appears to have been his trade-
mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply to a question from Sir Edward Carson wit-
ness said that he advocated in his paper that children
should be taught Swadeshi &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Did you advocate that children should bum every-
thing ?&rdquo; — ' There was a bonfire and I said &quot; You had
better commence your vow by sacrificing something &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; Was this to promote Anti-British feeling ?&rdquo; — ' No &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Darling : — &quot; Were the things burnt,
things which you could have produced in India?&rdquo; —
' Yes, they were produced on a large scale &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Did you do this to promote home industries ?'*
' Yes, a kind of protection for home industries &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Was there anything political in it ?&rdquo; — ' Not until
1905*.</p>
<p>384 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>*&rsquo; Why was it made political ?&rdquo; — ' To bring pressure
&lt;}n the British Government &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson then referred to education in
Swadeshi and the witness said that the Governor-Gene-
ral declared on June 14th, 19 10, that one of the Schools
was an unlawful institution.</p>
<p><em>&rsquo; Was that kept by a friend of yours ?'</em> — * An ac-
quaintance &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Was that man convicted afterwards ?&rdquo; — * Yes, of
sedition &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still a friend of yours ?&rdquo; — ' He is still an ac-
quaintance &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Most of your friends seem to have been convicted &quot;
■ — * No ; there are still some, who have not been &lsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson then referred to the murder of
Mr. Jackson and asked whether some men (whose names
quoted) were friends of the witness. Counsel inquired
whether one man was still in his employment.</p>
<p>The witness : — ' I think he is. I don&rsquo;t know. I am
here &lsquo;.</p>
<p>&quot; Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of him.&rdquo; — * I am not ashamed
of him. When members, who have been convicted sit
in Parliament, why should I be ashamed ?&rsquo; — (Laughter).</p>
<p>In opening the case for the defendants, Sir Edward
Carson delivered an address which was conceived in
bad taste. *&rsquo; A man who had been twice convicted of
sedition,~what character had he to vindicate ?&rdquo; asked
Sir Edward Carson. He said that the case must be
considered as a whole. The main charges made by Sir
V. Chirol against Mr. Tilak referred to the murders of
Messrs. Rand and Jackson. If the defendant was right
in saying that these were the results of the plaintiff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL 285</p>
<p>teachings, what became of the rest of the case ? During
the Plague at Poona, Mr. Rand had to risk his Ufe daily
on behalf of the afiflicted natives. His reward was that
he met his death at the hands of an assassin and it was
a fair inference that the murder was attributable to
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s utterances in the Kesari and the Mahratta,
He (Mr. Tilak) denounced Mr. Rand as a &quot; sullen,
suspicious tyrant &ldquo;, and even made the
horrible accusation that Mr. Rand deUberately
segregated people who were not suffering from Plague,
in order to keep up the figures. British soldiers, who
were risking their hves at is. a day, as volunteer sanitary
workers, were held up as inhuman beings who would
take advantage of the Plague to commit petty thefts
and break idols. The whole tenor of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s article
could be summarized thus : — &quot; Murder is right in cer-
tain circumstances. It can be apologised for. Shivaji
was right in murdering Afzulkhan, because Afzulkhan
was an oppressor. So long as we don&rsquo;t murder from
selfish motives, we are justified. Have we no Shivaji now ?
Murder in such circumstances is no murder.&rdquo; Is it a
wonder that a murder ensued ?</p>
<p>Sir Edward Carson then rapidly touched the remain-
ing four libels which, he said were trifles as compared to
Tilak&rsquo;s authorship of the murders of Rand and Jackson.</p>
<p>Sir John Simon in summing up the case said that the
question was not whether the plaintiff was a person who,
had, time and again, published seditious articles, or
whether his strong, violent and unrestrained criticism
of Government Officers was justified, nor was it the
question whether Mr. Tilak had the friendship of
Paranjpye and others. The question was whether Sir</p>
<p>286 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>v. Chirol&rsquo;s book contained matter defamatory to the
plaintiff. In dealing with the Rand and Jackson
murders, Sir Edward Carson had made some strange
omissions. Within a month of Mr. Rand&rsquo;s murder,
Mr. Tilak, who according to Sir V. Chirol was the real
author of the murder was prosecuted at Poona, not
on any charge connected with the murder, but a charge
of sedition, a striking fact, for the authorities had
every means of knowing how far Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s writings
were to blame. At that trial the Advocate-General
and the Judge, both expressly disclaimed the idea of
any connection between the articles and the murder.
Secondly in the very month, in which the murder was
committed, Lord Sandhurst had confirmed Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
election to the Legislative Council. Again when asked by
Sir Edward Carson if he had ever taken proceedings
against the Times of India, Mr. Tilak said he had—
much to the discomfiture of the defendant. He took
proceedings in Bombay and the Times of India came
to the court and not only apologized but did what was
very rare in Ubel actions — it went out of its way to give
an assurance that the apology was genuine. Regarding
the murder of Mr. Jackson, not a single denunciation of
Mr. Jackson by Mr. Tilak was produced. The confes-
sion of a wretched boy caught after the crime was not
the best evidence of the truth of the matters concerned.
Regarding the remaining four libels, not a scrap of evi-
dence had been given in the case. In conclusion he
said that no matters of colour or race or creed or reli-
gion should come in the way and that the Jury should
give Mr. Tilak unfailing justice even if the heavens
should fall. Mr. Justice Darling then summed up the</p>
<p>TILAK — V — CHIROL 287</p>
<p>case. He said that it was urged that Mr. Tilak was
guilty only of sedition, but what was worse than sedi-
tion but its bedfellow, high treason? How long a step was
it from articles &quot; seething with sedition &quot; to the overt
act which was necessary to constitute high treason ?
Dealing with the murder of Mr. Rand, His Lordship
said Mr. Tilak reminded him of the story in ^sop of
the enemy trumpeter who begged the soldier to spare
him on the ground that he was a non-combatant. The
soldier refused on the ground that without the trum-
peter&rsquo;s summons the enemy soldiers would not have
advanced. Turning to the case of Mr. Jackson His
Lordship said that it was true that he (Mr. Tilak) had
not singled out Mr. Jackson as he had singled out
Mr. Rand for denunciation, but it was enough that he
had created the atmosphere for the crime by stirring up
hatred of officials generally. Was it unjust to say that
he was the real author of the crime just as Fagin was
the real author of the crimes committed by his pupils ?
Concluding His Lordship said that he did not think
that he had ever tried a more serious case having re-
gard to its possible public consequences. He would
not submit the alleged libel to the Jury in snippets but
as a whole, as it has been pleaded. If they found that
in any part of it, the defendants had failed to make
good their plea of justification, they could find for the
plaintiff and award damages accordingly.</p>
<p>The Jury retired at 5-50P.M. (February 21st 1919, the
eleventh day of the proceedings) and after a deUbera-
tion of 25 minutes returned a verdict for the defendants.
Judgment was entered accordingly with costs.</p>
<p>As one distinguished writer said ** No Indian in Bri-</p>
<p>288 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>tain was more surprised at the verdict of the jury thatt
Mr. Tilak himself !&rdquo; With his inborn faith in British
Justice and in the truth and righteousness of his cause,
he had hoped — a hope supported by the best legal
advice available — to prove to the British Democracy
how the lofty, lawabiding patriotism of the Nationalist
Party had been grossly perverted to mean an illicit and
unholy alUance with the terrorist and the anarchist.
Standing on the crest of this victory he had hoped to-
explain to the British Democracy the tenets of the ad-
vanced political party in India. All these hopes were
dashed to the ground. It was not for nothing that Sir
Valentine had declared through his Counsel that he
** could have avoided the whole of this litigation by an
apology and by a subscription to the Indian Wax
ReUef Fund, but, in the interests of the Empire he felt
that, to make an apology under the circumstances of
this case or to withdraw or retract what he had deli-
berately stated and published would have been a dis-
aster of the very gravest kind as regards the Govern-
ment of India/&rsquo; The Morning Post, might ridicule Mr.
Tilak for his &quot; singular lack of humour &quot; in setting out
to prove &quot; the t3Tanny of a nation by pursuing one
of its own members through its own courts.&rdquo; Mr.
Tilak *s opponents have stigmatised this as &quot; incon-
ceivable folly &quot; and even some of his friends have
called it a * blunder *. It is easy to be wise after
the event. Mr. Tilak never required his character to
be &quot; whitewashed &quot; so far as Indians were concerned.
It was to cure the British Democracy of the &quot; slow
and persistent poison &quot; which had been at work
against his political party, that he dared mortgage all</p>
<p>fILAK— V — CHIROL 289</p>
<p>his estate and in the evening of his life, with tremen-
dous odds manifestly against him, fight with an op-
ponent basking in the sunshine of the Imperial Govern-
ment. Even this * blunder ' was creditable to him, in
that it showed his unflinching faith in the British Jus-
tice ; and it is doubtful whether the victory of Sir
Valentine Chirol has really helped the Government
when this victory has been followed by the loss of faith
in British Justice, in the minds of thousands and thou-
sands of Indians, whose confidence in the truth and
justice of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s cause was instinctive. When the
greatest Indian of the century was described before the
highest Judicial Tribunal of the Empire as one whose
reputation was not worth the smallest coin in existence,
when every kind of abusive epithet was hurled at his
devoted head with a levity truly disgusting, need we
wonder if people commenced to believe that even Bri-
tish Justice is capricious and uncertain ? Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
financial embarrassments — amounting to nearly three
lakhs of rupees — were, within a few weeks removed by
the love and loyalty of his friends and followers, but the
rude shock which India&rsquo;s faith in the &ldquo;British Justice*&rsquo;
has received, does not angur well for the future.</p>

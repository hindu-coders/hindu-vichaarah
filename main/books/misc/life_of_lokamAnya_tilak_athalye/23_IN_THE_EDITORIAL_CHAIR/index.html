<p>Great is Journalism. Is not every Able Editor a Ruler of
the World, being a persuader of it ; though self-elected yet
sanctioned by the sale of his Numbers ?</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. TILAK became the declared editor of the
Kesari on 22nd October 1887, and of the Mahratta
on 3rd Spetember 1891. Since then, he conducted these
journals as proprietor till the last, and though, the
editorship was occasionally transferred to others, still
he supplied the necessary inspiration, except during the
intervals when he was a guest of His Majesty&rsquo;s gaols.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, he neglected the Mahratta,
Indeed, it may be said, he never liked journalism in
Enghsh. He believed only in the vernacular as
an instrument of national awakening. Hence he
never cared to turn the Mahratta into a daily
newspaper. English weeklies in India have always been
a source of financial embarrassment to the conductors,
and the Mahratta was no exception to this rule. At
the time of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s death, the circulation of the
Mahratta stood at about 2000.</p>
<p>With the Kesari he was in his element. A weekly paper,
now with a circulation of over 35,000, it has moulded
the national life of Maharashtra during the last 30 years.
The Kesari, as the name indicates, stands for manli-</p>
<p>326 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>ness, strength. During all its vicissitudes, courage has
never failed it. Its wisdom has been occasionally chal-
lenged, its tact or fairplay. But not even the worst
enmies have whispered cowardice to its discredit.</p>
<p>During his life-time, Mr. Tilak conducted the Kesari
nominally as a proprietory concern. In the evening of
his life, he intended to put it on a democratic basis.
It was only latteriy that the Kesari was a financial suc-
cess. During the first lo years of his ownership of the
paper, it was burdened with a heavy debt. During the
last six years ctgain the extraordinary rise in the cost of
paper did not make it quite a profitable concern, and in
spite of the increase in the subscription rates, Mr. Tilak
had to succour the paper from the profits of the Gita-
Rahasya. Then there was the terrible expenditure of
the long- drawn Tai Maharaj case, which had to be pro-
vided for. In spite of all these difficulties, Mr. Tilak
had unreservedly placed the cash-box of the Kesari at
the entire disposal of the national propaganda. He
spent hundreds and thousands for the national work,
without boast or ostentation. He could have easily
saved large amounts by substantially increasing the
subscription, which his devoted readers would have
gladly paid ; but he accepted the Kesari as a sacred
trust and not as a business concern. He wanted it to
reach the hands of the poorest of the poor and become
the vehicle of his message. The cheapest and the best
—it had and has no second.</p>
<p>Though repeatedly pressed to turn it into a daily
paper, Mr. Tilak till the last kept it as a we3kly and it
was only last year that he made arrangements to bring
it oat as a bi-weekly. The ideal he had kept before</p>
<p>IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 32/</p>
<p>him — cheapness and excellence — was incompatible with
the hurry and cost of a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak and the Kesari were convertible terms.
Their careers have been synonmous with the history of
Maharashtra during the last 30 years. It has been a
period of storm and stress. It has witnessed a vast
transformation and has been the era of action and re-
action — ^political and social. Through rocks and shoals,
Mr. Tilak steered the Kc^sari, not caring for favour, nor
afraid of frown, with a grim S3nse of duty . He was
always bold but uniformly wary. His is one long
record of intellectual and moral intrepidity, sustained
by breadth of vision and depth of insight. The Kesari
has been a castle for national fight, reared under the
very nose of the Bureaucracy, proving impregnable even
under shells of repression. Truly, it has become a
national asset.</p>
<p>The style of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s Kesari was, like the physio-
gnomy of its illustrious editor, plain, blunt, and aggres-
sive. It was &quot; reason fused and made red-hot with
passion.&rdquo; It despised mere literary garnish and was the
very negation of the soft suppleness of an intellectual
epicurean. It had nothing of the flowing humour of Mr.
N. C. Kelkar&rsquo;s style, the sweatness of Mr. Pangarkar&rsquo;s,*
the grace of Mr. Agarkar&rsquo;s or of the subtle suggestiveness,
dehcate irony and arrcstive coquetry of Prof- S. M.
Paranjpye&rsquo;st style. It reminds you, not of a cloister</p>

<p>328 [lokamanya tilak</p>
<p>or an academy, not of a music-hall or a ball-room, but
of the battle-field. Straight, pointed, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s writ-
ten words, arrow-like whistled through the air and hit
the mark. They struck terror into the hearts of those
who opposed him. The flunkeys, the Government
minions and the busy nobodies were as mortally afraid
of them as were the Reformers, the Moderates or the
Liberals. Even the powerful Bureaucracy, protected by
the prestige of the British Empire and the swords and
guns of two hundred thousand soldiers, feared his at-
tacks. Mr. Tilak has been frequently blamed for his
strong language. We should, however, remember that
he was the centre of acute political and social contro-
versies extending over one generation. He could not
be expected to rouse the masses to a sense of self-respect,
self-reliance, and self-confidence except by pointed lan-
guage. He, however, never hit below the belt. His
criticism was impetuous but never vulgar, mean or
vindictive. It bore ' no spots which all the perfumes
of Arabia could not sweeten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His instructions to his assistants reveal the secret of
his direct but homely style. &quot; Imagine that you are
speaking to a villager and not writing for University
people. No Sanskrit words please. Avoid quoting sta-
tistics. Don&rsquo;t scare away the reader by quoting figures.
Keep them to yourself. Let your style be simple and
homely. It should be as clear as day-light. The
meaning must never be obscure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was as good as his advice. True, in the early
nineties, the Kesari was written in a more learned style.
The exuberant scholarship of Mr. Tilak peeped through
every column. Not a subject under the sun, but</p>
<p>IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 329</p>
<p>iound its way in the Kesari. At a minute&rsquo;s notice he
poured forth columns of wonderful learning, duly
adorned with a literary setting. Religion, philosophy,
economics, agriculture, astronomy, science — there was
no subject too difficult for his pen or mind. He not
only assimilated all the available knowledge on the
subject in hand, but put his own stamp on it. His
luminous and often original writmgs on knotty
questions of philosophy or science are an intellectual
treat and would repay a careful perusal even to-day.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tilak soon realised that it is not seed, lavishly
sown that bears fruit, but the seed that is carefully put
under the earth. This made him take into consider-
ation the intellectual level of his readers. He put him-
self the question &quot; Whom do I write for ?&rdquo; and it was
got long before he gave himself the correct answer.
uince then, his writings and speeches tended more and
more to simplicity, without losing an iota of vigour.</p>
<p>The equipment which he brought to bear on his edi-
torial work was indeed, extremely rare, not only in
this country but in any other. Possessed of a profound
knowledge of the law, he did not care what restrictions the
Government put on the freedom of the Press. He was
prepared, he used to say, to convey his message under
any rigours imposed by the law. Only the Bureau-
cracy must adhere to the compact and must not shuffle
its position again and again and try to seek new meaning
into the definition of sedition every time, by straining
its words and distorting their import and significance.</p>
<p>His complete mastery over the Sanskrit language and
literature, Vedic and post-Vedic, classical and philoso-
phical, enabled him not only to form a style at once simple</p>
<p>33P LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and eloquent, but to free journalistic diction from
the unnatural pompousness — too often mistaken for
eloquence, which the study of English classics had
brought into Marathi. He formed a new style in
Marathi journalism, and most of the Marathi journals
of the day have adopted it.</p>
<p>His profound knowledge of philosophy, science,
metaphysics — Indian and European — stood him in
good stead not only in making scholarly criticisms, but
in the leading controversies of the last 30 years. Our
social and religious life, ideas and institutions, are, so
to speak, in the melting pot and the changes that are
to be introduced must suit the basic ideas of our society.
Mr. Tilak believed in what may be termed, &quot; Indian
Sociology &quot; as Mr. Ranade did in &quot; Indian Economics.&rdquo;
His attitude towards Social Reform was largely deter-
mined by sociological considerations. Others had seen
only the crust that lies on the Indian civilisation
and had pronounced it to be worthless. Mr. Tilak
had gone deeper and had learnt how precious our
culture is.</p>
<p>He had studied the constitutional laws and histories
of England and other European countries. Politics
was his sp3cial study and he wanted to write an original
thesis on this subject. At Mandalay, he devoted all his
leisure to the study of the French and the German.</p>
<p>It would thus be seen that the range of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
reading was enormously vast. But he was not a mere
reader of books. He meditated profoundly on what he
read. He supplemented his reading and thinking by
communicating with the best minds of his age. His
active life afforded the necessary corrective to his</p>
<p>IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 33r</p>
<p>tiioaghts. The combination of a thinker and a fighter
ia the person of its editor, gave the Kesari that amazing
hold over its readers, which has hardly a parallel.</p>
<p>Possessed of a wonderful memory, Mr. Tilak never
cared to cultivate those methods by which many a
newspaper writer tries to lessen the burden on his memo-
ry. Mr. Tilak never kept notes nor topic-books. What
he read, he remembered. What he remembered was
alwaj^ ready at his beck and call. Quotations, extracts,
references — everything was ready at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. When he began to dictate articles for
the Kesari, his amanuensis could, with very great
difficulty, keep pace with him. But though Mr. Tilak
was a rapid reader and a rapid writer, he was a very
careful student. Before commencing to dictate, he
carefully studied the question in all its bearing, ransack-
ed all the available literature on the subject and then
considered himself ready for the task. Thoroughness
was the secret of his success.</p>
<p>As the political life of the people is developing, it has
been found necessary to supply suitable equivalents for
English political terminology. Such v/ords as, Respon-
sible Government, Imperial Federation, Passive Resis«
tance, despotism. Limited Monarchy, Budget, Decentra-
lization, do not easily lend themselves to translation.
The brunt of the work of coining suitable Marathi
words congenial to the genius of the language, had
mainly fallen on Mr. Tilak, and it was very interesting
and instructive to find this all-India leader discussing
occassionally with his sub-editors possible equivalents
to knotty political terms. Tlie word ' Bureaucracy ' in
particular baffled him for a number of years and though</p>
<p>332 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>he translated it by * Adhikari Varga, still he was not
quite pleased with the expression. It was in the course
of a lecture that the word * Nokarshahi ' occurred to
him. So delighted was he with this word, that he
called some of his literary friends at the end of the
speech, and shared with them his joy at the addition of
an extremely nice word to the Marathi vocabulary.
Like the elephant of the story, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s intellectual
tusk, strong enough to bear the load of heavy timber,
was also capable of lifting up a pin. His genius was
.at once comprehensive and subtle.</p>
<p>The expression &quot; old wine in new bottles &lsquo;* is gene-
rally an empty compliment. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s discussion of
abstruse political theories, however, never struck his
readers as something outlandish, something developed
and prepared thousands of miles away and thence
imported into India. His readers always felt at home
with his writings and were never repelled by the English
political thought which he discussed in Marathi. Mr.
Tilak not only made his reader understand him, he made
him also remember the main points in his writings.
Some words, some expressions, some sentences in his
articles always lingered in the memory of the reader.
The article may be forgotten, but such words stick to
the memory. Usually the title of the heading of the
article was pithy and expressive. It summed up the
whole of the article in some striking phrase. He always
said that a good heading was worth half the writing.</p>
<p>The object of the propagandist is to influence his
readers. He seeks inspiration from the people, and
returns it thousandfold. He receives instruction and
imparts it at compound interest. Mr. Tilak bore this</p>
<p>IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 333.</p>
<p>truth in mind while conducting the Kesari. He con-
centrated all his energies on the work of national
awakening. Whatever helped that work found a place
in the Kesari ; otherwise it was shunned, though the
very best. People went to the Kesari, not to get news,
but to interpret it. Their estimates of men and things
were largely influenced by the Kesari. Their attitude
was determined by that of the Kesari. A compliment
from the Kesari has built up many a career ; its censure
has marred it. Verily it has been a great dictator,
though a benevolent one.</p>
<p>This then, is the work of the Kesari. It has formed
the style of Marathi Journalism ; it has expanded the
thought-expressing capacity of the Marathi language.
It has familiarised the people with the political thought
of modern European life. It has widened the
outlook of the sons of the soil. It has roused
them to a consciousness of the glorious past and
the wretched present. It has inspired them with
new hope for the future. It has concentrated
their attention to the live political issue ; and has
mercilessly thrust in the back-ground, whatever was
not directly concerned with that issue. It has set an
example of devotion, of sacrifice, of plain speaking and
of courage. It has taught them to keep their heads
cool in storms and rear them again after the hurricane
spent its force. It has been the centre of political edu-
cation, the source of political agitation, and the pivot
of aU national organization, in Western India. As one
speaker aptly put it, it has transformed the Maharash-
tra of 1890 to what it is in 192 1.</p>

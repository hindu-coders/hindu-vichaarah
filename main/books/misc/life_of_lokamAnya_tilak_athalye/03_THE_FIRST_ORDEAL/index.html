  <p>Ruby wine is drunk by knaves.<br>

The Hero is not fed on sweets.<br>
Daily his own heart he eats ;+++(5)+++<br>
Chambers of the great are jails.<br>
And head-winds right for royal sails.</p>
<p>Emerson</p>
<p>IT has been said of Buddha that the sight, in quick
succession, of disease, old age and death took away
forever the smile from his lips and joy from his mind
and thenceforth the Lord of Compassion devoted all his
energies to the solution of the problem of misery.
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s youthful thoughts, too, were clouded by
three great events, which produced an indelible impression on his sensitive spirit and here we must seek
for the motive which led him to dedicate his life to
the service of the Mother-land. The lirst of these
events was the deposition (1875) of the late H. H.
Malharrao Gaekwar and his subsequent trial, by a
special commission, on the charge of having attempted
to poison his Resident Col. Phayre.+++(5)+++ People in the
Baroda State and outside, strongly believed in the innocence of the Maharaja who was not restored to his
throne though the Commission differed in its findings.
The fate of a hapless Indian Prince, who ought to
have got at least the benefit of doubt created a deep
wound in Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s mind ; for its patriotism was
not outlandish, based merely on the perusal of the
works of Mill and Bright. It was essentially Indian,
and was directly derived from a contemplation of
the great and heroic deeds of Shivaji and his descend-
ants. The Maratha History of the 17th and 18th Centu-
ries formed the Bible of his patriotism and his blood
was aflame when he reflected on the utter impotence
to which the representatives of the Empire-builders
of the 1 8th century were reduced.</p>
<p>If the rumbling of a widespread insurrection attended the birth of Mr. Tilak, the year of his graduation (1876) was marked by an abortive attempt
to overturn the British Government. This attempt
was confined only to some parts of Maharashtra. Its
authors were a few fanatics under the leadership of
Wasudeo Balvant Phadke, a clerk in Government
employ. The enthusiasm of these people far exceeded
their limitations. They had neither birth nor fortune
to impress the imagination of the public. Wasudeo
Balvant scarcely took note of the practical disappear-
ance of the martial instincts of the race, the apathy
and ignorance of the masses, the denationalisation of
the classes, the sloth of the degenerate descendants of
the old aristocracy.+++(4)+++ His attempts were doomed to
failure ; and they could only bring with them their
inevitable legacy — repression and suspicion. The
Brahmins — Poona Brahmins especially — were the
greatest sufferers. Even a ' model ' Moderate like
Ranade, whose only ' mistake ' in life was a youthful
essay on Shivaji, that deprived him temporarily of
his fellowship in the Elphinstone College, did not
escape suspicion. The impression of the two upheavels of 1857 and 1876 on the mind of Mr. Tilak
was in inverse proportion to their magnitude and
importance. The former was an incident which hap-
pened when he was quite a baby and so the impres-
sion which he formed concerning it in his boyhood
was necessarily hazy. In the case of the latter, our
hero was a full-fledged gentleman, well-armed and
equipped with knowledge and reason. He saw how
immature, thoughtless and foolish the attempt of
Wasudev Balavant was ; and from this time must be
dated his horror of bloody revolutions. He clearly
saw that if Indians had to fight with Anglo-Indian
despots, it could only be, not with sword and gun,
but with pen and tongue. He saw that the secret of
the English power in India lay in their superior edu-
cation and organisation, and that we could wrest that
power only by meeting the English on their own
ground. The collection of a few fire-arms and the
slaughter of a handful of of&amp;cials would not shake
the well-established British Government in India and
such attempts would only recoil upon us by rivetting
our chains.</p>
<p>The third event that impressed his youthful heart was
the terrible famine of 1877-8 with its toll of 50 lakhs
of lives.+++(4)+++ He passed sleepless nights and began to find
out the cause of such an abnormal condition.
Throughout his life Mr. Tilak was a friend of the
poor. Even Mr. Nevinson, a casual acquaintance of
his was impressed with Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s concern for the
poor. It was here, in this terrible famine of 1877-8,
that his sympathy for the poor was roused. To add
insult to injury, the advisers of Queen Victoria the
Good induced her to assume the title of ** Kaiser-
i-Hind &quot; in this very year of famine and starvation.</p>
<p>The impressions of these events were strengthened by
the companionship of a congenial friend and the mes-
sage of an inspiring leader. Since 1874, the young men
of Maharashtra were watching with passionate enthusiasm the appearance of a luminary in the literary
firmament of Poona. This luminary was no other
than the illustrious Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, son
of Krishnashastri, the memory of whose ability and
learning is still green. The house of Krishnashastri
was the favourite resort of all the leading hghts of
Maharashtra; and of the interesting and instructive
discourses of his father, Vishnu, shy and studious,
silent and thoughtful, was an attentive listener. So
when, after passing the Matriculation he joined the
Deccan College, he could carry thither a correctness of
taste and a depth and variety of knowledge which
many graduates could not claim. While many of his
fellow-students were abusing the liberty of college-
life and the liberality of their parents in a variey of
ways, the excesses of Vishnu were merely intellectual
and amounted to nothing more than a passionate
study of history and literature, to the neglect of
Logic and Mathematics. After graduation in 1872,
he was persuaded to accept a school-master&rsquo;s post in
the Educational Department, but this did not prevent
from starting, in 1874, the famous magazine, the
Nibandhamala, which by its magnificent rhetorical
style and trenchant criticism of the Government and
of the social and religious movements of the day won
instant renown. It was clear that the pioneer of a
new School of National thought had arisen, able and
eager to fight with the pajty led by Ranade.</p>
<p>The intellectual plane of Ranade was certainly more
elevated than that of Chiploonkar. In profundity
of thought, in depth and variety of learning he was
unequalled. He had tried his best to organise and discipline a generation of social and religious iconoclasts.
He had tried to lead the destructive and rebellious spirit
of his time into the constructive channels of Social
Reform. He wanted to build a Rationalistic Church
out of the materalistic and agnostic elements born of
Western education. On the other hand, Vishnusha:stri,
instead of trying to &quot; reform &quot; the people, wanted to
rouse them to a consciousness of the glory of their
history and religion. Heartily disgusted with the
shallowness of the public movements of his time, he
called upon the rising generation to make sacrifices ;
and he himself led the way by &quot; snapping asunder
(1879) the chain (of service) once and for ever &quot; and
resolved &quot; to try what might be done for public good
with the potent instrumentality of a press establish-
ment worked by a vigorous hand.&quot;*</p>
<p>The example and message of Vishnushastri had
undoubtedly a stimulating effect upon Mr. Tilak. They
also influenced Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s chief
companion in the Deccan College. The early life of
this remarkable man was one long fight with &quot; chill
penury.&rdquo; Neglected by relatives, occasionally insulted
by those whose help he had to seek, this man had
faith enough to grapple, undaunted, with every difficulty.
When taunted with poverty he had the spirit
to tell his teacher — a distinguished M.A. — that he, too,
would some day take the degree of Master of Arts.
Poverty has <em>&rsquo; repressed &lsquo;</em> many a &quot; noble rage .&rdquo; It
sours a man and makes him cynical. But even
stark povery failed to repress the noble instincts of
Agarkar. Not a wrong in this world but had him as
its champion ; not a cause of liberty or reform but
gained his support. A student of Logic and Moral
Philosophy, he had lost much of his faith in religion.
But there was another Faith, to him higher and
nobler, a Faith which evoked the finest qualities of
his heart. The pent-up and ungratified desires of long
poverty generally tempt a man to their enjoyment at
the first opportunity. But such was the greatness of
Agarkar that when such an opportunity was within
his easy reach, he wrote to his mother &quot; You may be
waiting, mother dear, for your son to become an
M. A. and lift you up from all the misery that haunts
you. I, however, have decided to turn my back on
money and happiness and dedicate my life to the
service of the country.&rdquo; This utter self-denial, after
a life of stark poverty would alone establish Agarkar&rsquo;s
title to the ever-lasting gratitude of his countrymen.</p>
<p>There was one point on which Tilak and Agarkar
-did not agree, even in their college days ; it was Social
Reform. While admitting the existence of evils and
the necessity of eradicating them, Mr. Tilak held
that reform, to be lasting, could only be a growth from
within ; that hasty measures and intemperate talk
would only retard the cause of reform; that reform
should not be mere imitation of Western life and
culture but should be based on a proper understanding
of the genius of our race and the traditions of our
society ; that the key-note of Indian life is purity
more than freedom and that in all programmes of
social reform we cannot too much lay stress on this
cardinal principle.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>But though the attitude of Tilak towards Social
Reform differed essentially from that of Agarkar, still
they were agreed that this difference in view-point
should not prevent both from co-operating with each
other with respect to the main part of the
programme which was education in the widest
sense of the term.+++(4)+++ To cover the Presidency with a
network of schools was only a part of their aspira-
tions. They wanted to do something more ; they
wanted to educate the masses by imparting to them
democratic ideas and enlightening them on the
true state of the country. The birth of the New
English School on the one hand and of the Kesari and
the Mahratta on the other, heralded in Maharashtra a
new era and galvanised its public life and the credit of
this achievement must be given to Chiploonkar, Tilak
and Agarkar.</p>
<p>To this band of enthusiastic workers, Ranade gave
his blessings and something more ; he recommended to
their notice Mahadeo Ballal Namjoshi, whose versatile
powers, keen perception, sound experience and tactful,
pushing nature more than compensated for his lack of
academic training. Mr. Namjoshi&rsquo;s indefatigable
energy and immense resourcefulness helped his colleagues to tide over numerous crises and earned for
him the title of &quot; our foreign secretary.&rdquo; To Tilak, he pariicularly attached himself; and the almost brotherly friendship that sprang between them remained
unclouded till 1895, when Namjoshi closed his brilliant
career without leaving the wherewithal to perform his
funeral ceremony.</p>
<p>Another man, not less useful, joined them soon after.
Vaman Shivram Apte, the celebrated lexicographer had
earned in his college career high repute as an accomplished scholar and immediately on passing his M. A.
examination had been engaged temporarily as Head
Master in a Mission School. He tried his best to get a
very good post in the Educational Department. But
such is the rigidity of red-tape, that he was offered the
modest post of an assistant master in an Anglo-Vernacular school. When the founders of the New English
School heard this, they at once approached Mr. Apte
and secured his services for the school as its Superin-
tendent. The choice was most appropriate. Mr. Apte
fully justified his selection for the post by the diligent
and thorough manner in which he discharged his duties.
He had in him the school-master&rsquo;s instinct, which
taken at its best means a strict but temperate sense of
discipline, patience with ignorance, system in exposition,
attention to minute details and a readiness to plod un-
wearied through the dull monotony of school-life.</p>
<p>The Vernacular newspapers in Western India were,
in those days mostly conducted by political dilettanti
and self-seeking business-men. They therefore could not
be expected to properly serve the cause of the public.
The only important exceptions were The Indu-Prakash,
the Dnyana-Prakash, the Native Opinion and the Subodh
Patrika. These, out of the 77 newspapers conducted by
the &quot; Natives &quot; commanded some influence. At such a
time, therefore, the appearance of the Kesari (Marathi.
weekly) and of the Mahratta (English weekly), with self-
sacrificing and patriotic proprietors evoked the liveliest,
appreciation in the mind of the public and considerable
uneasiness in the mind of the Government. The appre-
ciation of the public was shown by the rapid increase
in the circulation of the Kesari — reaching nearly 4,350
within three years and the uneasiness of the Government stands mirrored in a remark in the Report (1882),
on the Native Press which characterized the &ldquo;prevailing
tone &quot; of the Kesari as &ldquo;unfriendly to the Government.&rdquo; This left-handed compliment conclusively
proves that even in its infancy, the Kesari had distinguished itself by its fearlessness. We do not however,
find the rigorous editorial discipline which we have
learnt to associate with the name of Mr. Tilak. This
was but natural. The proprietors were, one and all,
very young and had yet to form sound views on many
of the social and religious questions of the day. The
editorial eloquence of Agarkar was still in its dawn ;
the exuberant rhetorical style of Vishnushastri felt
the limitations of a newspaper article ; nor do we any-
where find the &ldquo;parthian shots&rdquo; of Mr. Tilak, his inci-
sive logic and trenchant criticism. With all their-
faults, the news-papers — especially the Kesari — supplied
the wants of their readers and were everywhere
praised with warmth and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As editor of the Mahratta, Mr. Tilak always championed the people&rsquo;s cause and in criticising the policy
of high officials made no distinction between white
and black Bureaucrats. He watched with the greatest
solicitude the administration of Indian States, The
affairs of Kolhapur in particular attracted his attention.
Since 1870, the condition of Kolhapur was far from
desirable. In that year died Rajaram Maharaj and in
the year following his two widows adopted Prince
Shivajirao. Though under good guardianship, the
young Prince began to show, ever since 1877, signs of
insanity and was often subject to delusions and suicidal
tendencies. It was generally believed that this mental
derangement was due to compulsory adminstration of
intoxicating drugs to the Prince. The author of this
mischief was supposed to be Rao Bahadur Barve,
State Karbhari, who, spurred by the Queen-
Dowager Sakawarbai, wanted to remove the Maharaja
from the Gadi either by death or by proof of his lunacy
and to have a new youth adopted by the Dowager.
People, high and low believed in these rumours, and
on November 24th 1881, a monster meeting was held at
Poona under the presidency of so distinguished and so
moderate a gentleman as the late Hon. Rao Bahadur
Gopalrao Hari Deshmukh. In this meeting, a resolution was passed, suggesting that the Prince should
be immediately put under the guardianship of some
trustworthy persons. Soon after this meeting was
held, it was rumoured that an attempt was actually
made on the life of the young Maharaja, and while
the alarm caused by this rumour had not subsided,
Tilak and Agarkar got three letters purporting to be
written by the Karbhari. In these letters the plan of
poisoning the Prince was plainly suggested ; and believing that these letters were genuine, Tilak and Agarkar
published them in the Mahratta and the Kesari and
challenged the State Karbhari, if he dared, to prove
his innocence before a court of law.</p>
<p>Thus brought to bay, Rao Bahadur Barve had to
accept the challenge with grim determination. He
hauled up before the Bombay High Court Tilak and
Agarkar and some of his enemies at Kolhapur. His
contention was that his enemies at Kolhapur had
formed themselves into a caucus and had determined
to blaspheme him. His arch-opponent was one Nana
Bhide who having been refused a pleader&rsquo;s Sanad,
had sought to wreck his vengeance by machinations
in and outside the State. A willing tool was found by
Nana Bhide in the natural mother of the Prince who
had a grievancs of her own against the Diwan. Find-
ing themselves impotent to do mischief in the State,
these persons had gone over to Poena, caught the ear
of a credulous public and having approached the
inexperienced editors of the Kesari and the Mahratta,
secured an outlet for their fury. The letters, purporting to be his were mere fabrications made by
Nana Bhide. He had never plotted against the life or
the gadi of his master. The accusations made against
him were wantonly wicked and he called for exemplary
punishment of the offenders.</p>
<p>The sympathies of an admiring public centred round
Tilak and Agarkar. They had championed the cause
of the representative of the historic dynasty of
Shivaji the Great. They could gain nothing and had
risked much for the peace and happiness of an unlucky
Prince. They were defended by the combined ability
and eloquence of Bombay&rsquo;s rising leaders — the
fiery Mehta and the sweet-tempered Telang.</p>
<p>The three letters, of course, formed the pivot of the
case. Were they genuine ? The State Karbhari as-
serted that they were not ; Nana Bhide till the last
persisted in holding that they were. Who could throw
light on the question ? Some witnesses from Kolhapur
were expected to solve the riddle. But, though sum-
moned they did no elect to appear. The High Court
could not compel attendance ; for the witnesses were
beyond its jurisdiction. Neither the Political Agent
nor the Government of Bombay were willing to interfere as the case was a private one. The decision of
the High Court went against Nana Bhide. The
letters were pronounced to be unreliable. Tilak and
Agarkar tendered a graceful apology. But the wrath
of Barve was not to be so appeased. He pressed for
conviction ; and Tilak and Agarkar, though declared
&ldquo;free from any suspicion of malvolence &quot; were found
guilty of having &quot; thoughtlessly published defama-
tory &quot; articles and were sentenced (i6th july 1882) each
to four months simple imprisonment.</p>
<p>The decision of the High Court caused no surprise,
for it was fully anticipated ; and so when Tilak and
Agarkar were seated in a closed carriage and taken
to the Dongri jail, they were rather proud of having
been thus able to show their devotion to their country.
Being inmates of the same cell, they could compare
notes, review their conduct, weigh men and things,
discuss future schemes and past mistakes. Such
discussions were often carried far into the night
and then the bugs and fleas of the dungeon were for-
gotten ; not so the warders&rsquo; reprimands for having
broken the stillness of the night by their loud and at
times heated conversation. In spite of such &quot; lapses&rdquo;
Tilak and Agarkar were on the whole fairly &quot; well
behaved &quot; and got 21 days&rsquo; remission for &quot; good
conduct.&rdquo; The disgusting nature of the gaol-diet
told heavily on their health, Mr. Tilak losing as much
as 24 lbs. in weight. But they never complained ,
Only one thing troubled them ; time hung heavily
upon them and they even envied those of their fellow-
prisoners who had been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. Wearied of inaction, they sent in an application to the General Superintendent of gaols for
some sort of work and were glad to find that he was
kind enough to place books and writing materials
at their disposal.</p>
<p>While Tilak and Agarkar were in gaol, a movement, headed by the late Principal Wordsworth
and the late Hon. Mr. Mandlik was started to petition
the Government to intervene and save these youths
from the rigours of prison-life. The appeal fell on
deaf ears. The Dinbandhu very properly said &quot; In-
stead of applying to Government for the cancellation
of the punishment, let us show our regard for the
patriotic prisoners by giving them a right royal reception on their return.&rdquo; On October 26th 1882,
Tilak and Agarkar walked out of the portals of
Dongri, free men once more. Enthusiastic crowds
awaited them outside. They were borne off in
triumph. Addresses were presented; laudatory speeches
wese made ; and the only reply our heroes could,
make to all this overwhelming kindness was to declare
that Prisons would never have any terrors for them
and would never deter them from discharging
bravely and sincerely their duties. Soon after,
Agarkar ceased to be a politician and confined his
attention only to Education and Social Reform.
Mr. Tilak, however, was privileged frequently to
enjoy the hospitality of His Majesty&rsquo;s gaols ; and un-
broken in his resolution, he pursued till the end his
self-chosen work of National uplift.</p>
<p>We must not forget to mention that while the
Defamation case was proceeding, Gopal Krishna
Gokhale, then a mere college student acted a female
part in a drama the proceeds of which were to go
to the fund started to help Tilak and Agarkar.+++(5)+++ It is
under these circumstances that Gokhale&rsquo;s name
has been first introduced to the public. Considering
the future relations between Gokhale and Tilak, who
will not love to linger on the fragrant memory of this
small but significant episode ?</p>

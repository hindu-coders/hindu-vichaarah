<p>The highest praise that has yet been accorded to
Lokamanya Tilak has come, curiously enough, from the
Hon. Mr. Gokhale who is reported to have said to an
Enghsh friend that, bom a hundred and twenty years
before, Mr. Tilak would have carved out a kingdom for
himself.+++(5)+++ This pithiest and most appropriate compliment pictures for us Mr. Tilak as he really was, not a
product of the Western Civilisation and of the English
Government but a solitary surviver of the race which
four generations back had well-nigh conquered the whole
of India. It was impossible for him to be assimilated,
like most of his countrymen by and in the mighty
Enghsh Government ; nor could that Government crush
his spirit and make him a helpless spectator of our
downfall. He was every inch a soldier a soldier
in a civilians&rsquo; garb. The Press and the Plaftorm were
his field of action; and from this battlefield he waged
a relentless war on the Indian Bureaucracy for nearly
forty years. He alone of all others dared strike the
shield of the Government with the &quot; sharp end of the
steel.&rdquo; The silent suffering country wanted a man
who could speak out without mincing matters, one who
could boldly stand up for cur birth-right held in pawn
by the rulers of the land. Where could such an one be
found except in the great Mahratta race ?</p>
<p>Bal Gangadar Tilak was born at Ratnagiri on July
23rd, 1856. Born in a race to which the Peshwas be-
longed and in a town not far away from the birth-place
of Balaji Vishwanath, he was, indeed, destined to play
the role of a representative of those who had ruled the
greater part of India for nearly a hundred years. In
the year of his birth the political atmosphere in India
was electric. It was a remarkable year for this remarkable child to be ushered into existence. It was as ominous to the new rulers of the land as this child was
destined to be. Lord Dalhousie, the last of the aggres-
sive proconsuls of the British East India Company had
just departed, cutting off all the Native poppies that
dared appear tall among the degenarates of the vanquished races of India, and while he was thus stretching
the red canvas over the country, the last vestiges of the
Imperial families of Delhi and of Satara were
swept away, with the result that he left a legacy as
fatal to his successor as Lord Chelmsford has done
to the present Viceroy. Hindus and Mahomedans
smarting under the humiliation of eclipsed crescent
and Bhagva Zenda had made common cause.
The unity was no doubt temporary, the result of a
common wrong ; the essential condition for a successful
revolution was wanting, the proletariat being unwilling
to be disturbed by the wails and woes of the feudal
landlords with their figure-head Royalties. So the
rising ended in smoke, making the Enghsh still more
secure in the land.</p>
<p>Thus it was that when Bal, the only son and second
child of Gangadharpant {alias Nana) Tilak was passing
the early days of his life in his home at Ratnagiri, re-
markable deeds of grim valour and cruel carnage were
an every-day occurance in distant Delhi. The red
fury of inflamed soldiery that had set the whole country
ablaze must have borne its flues and sparks to the
birth-place of our hero, at least in the form of a wonder-
ful crop of rumours. It is inconceivable that the green
memory of these things should have failed to impress
the imagination of a child whose whole life was a dedi-
cation to the service of the Motherland.</p>
<p>What little is known of Bal&rsquo;s mother shows that she
was a kind-hearted and an intensely religious woman.
His father was one of those gems &quot; of purest ray serene&rdquo;
that for want of favourable opportunities lie concealed
in the deep &quot; caverns of the ocean.&rdquo; Born in August
1820, he had passed the early years of his boyhood in
dreaming dreams of learning and high social position
and had, after finishing his vernacular course of instruction at Dabhol (Dist. Ratnagiri), walked over, in those
days of difficult travelling to Poona. At a time when
a boy learning English had every kind of encouragement
given to him. Nana would surely have been able to complete his studies ; but a domestic misfortune compelled
him to bid good-bye to all his ambitions and rest content, as a school master, with the &quot; splendid &quot; salary of Rs. 10 per mensem. But though he was thus called
upon to waste his abilities in the cramping atmosphere of vernacular school-life, he never neglected his
duties nor did he abandon his favourite pursuit of
knowledge. All his leisure was devoted to the
study of Mathematics, Sanskrit and Marathi ; and
his mastery over the several branches of these subjects enabled him to bring out two books, the
one on Trigonometry and the other on Marathi
Grammar.+++(5)+++ But neither the scholarship of Gangadharpant
nor his conscientious discharge of duties could make
his superiors forget or overlook his stern sense of
personal independence. The inevitable consequence
followed : he was neglected in official preferment.
It was only after full 17 years of service, when
his claims could not with decency be set aside, that he
was rewarded with the much-coveted post of an Assist-
ant Deputy Educational Inspector and was transferred
to Poona (1866).</p>
<p>The intensely religious vein of the mother and the
stern sense of personal independence of the father re-
flected themselves in the wilful nature of the boy, a
characteristic which has played no insignificant part in
his future career. This delicate child of a delicate
mother was not put to school before he was 11, not certainly for want of facilities — Ratnagiri was a District
town — but evidently because, the father, himself a
school-master, intended to give his son a good grounding in Sanskrit and vernacular in the unfettered freedom of home-life.+++(5)+++ Bal proved wonderfully responsive
to his father&rsquo;s instructions. He loved his childish plays
no doubt, but, evea at that age the ponderous volumes
in his father&rsquo;s library impressed him more. One
book particularly attracted his fancy. He had heard
his father reading the sonorous periods of Bana&rsquo;s
Kadamhari and believing the book to be no more difficult than the holy Sanskrit verses he was set to recite
every evening, he went up to his father and asked for
the loan of the book. Startled with the request, but unwilling to dispirit his son by a curt refusal Gangadharpant promised to give the book on one condition. A
knotty problem in Arithmetic was set ; Bal was to
work it out and have the book. Armed with slate and
pencil, Bal waged a relentless war on the problem for
an hour and a half and carried off the prize amidst the
applause of the proud mother and the loving sister.</p>
<p>This was the first triumph of Bal&rsquo;s life. His poor
mother did not live to see others. Her health, naturally delicate, undermined by frequent fasting gave way
and she died (1866) before realising an Indian mother&rsquo;s
ambition of getting her son married. Sometime later,
Bal was sent to school. He jumped from standard to
standard and was soon transferred to the Poona High
School whence he matriculated in 1872. The rigid formality of the classes, with its accompaniment of churchyard silence utterly disgusted him.+++(5)+++ The spectacle of
mediocre teachers hammering scrappy stuff, styled
knowledge into the mediocre brains of students was not
calculated to charm a boy to whom reading was understanding and committing to memory no labour. The race of marks and of rank could never allure him;
His unwillingness to take down notes and translations
was an enigma to his teachers. He was content that he
had learnt the lessons and was quite indifferent to the
expression. He cared more for knowledge than for
words, more for thoughts than for the expression. But
the traditional cast of the teachers&rsquo; mind could not
reahse that the brain is more often a better
register than the copy-book and that what goes to the
copy-book generally misses the memory. Bal however
stuck to his methods. When at work in Mathematics,
he solved all the examples orally and put down only
the answer. &quot; Where is your method &quot; asked the precise
pedagogue. &ldquo;It is here &quot; said our hero, pointing to
his head.</p>
<p>Such an &ldquo;unmethodical &quot; and rebellious child was
never likely to be popular with the teachers, who on oc-
casions took complaints to his father. Bal cared little for
their good opinion and less for their &quot; time-honoured &lsquo;*
methods. His father was intensely proud of him and
presaged for him a great career. The promising son of
the Assistant Deputy Inspector, could not, in those days
of early marriages, long escape the fetters of wedlock.
A suitable bride was found in Tapibai, daughter of
Ballal Bal of Ladghar (Dist. Ratnagiri), to whom he was
married in 1871. Soon after this event happened two
others, the one favourable and the other extremely un-
fortunate. Bal passed his Matriculation in December
1872 ; but only a few months before his success in the
examination his father died, leaving him quite an.
orphan. &ldquo;It is the bitterest element in the vast irony
of human life that the time-worn eyes, to which a
son&rsquo;s success would have brought the purest gladness are
so often closed for ever, even before success has come.&rdquo; +++(* Morley&rsquo;s Life of Cobden)+++</p>
<p>When Bal joined (1873) the Deccan College as a resi-
dent student, the Bombay University and its affiliated
Colleges were not quite as old as their alumni. The
rough and ready methods of the East India Company&rsquo;s
Government were, by this time being gradually substituted by Institutions more imposing under the direct
rule of the Queen-Empress. In matters educational,
Colonel-Professors and Major-Directors were giving
place to graduates from Oxford and Cambridge ; and
although this new University ware was not as a rule a
very great improvement on the former military commodity, it was, at least, imbued with the atmosphere of the English academies. Howsoever opinions may differ as
to the value of the knowledge Indian students acquired
at these Institutions, one thing was certain that they
were not slow to admire the gowns and caps of the sartorial Major-domoes, in whose orbits it was their destiny to fall.</p>
<p>Persons of parasitic psychology, whose main purpose
is to make the present comfortable without a thought
to the future may deride the idea of National Education.
But those who can think for themselves are
painfully aware of the disadvantages of imbibing foreign
ideas through a foreign medium at an immature but
impressionable time of life.+++(5)+++ The system of education
transplanted from England to India by well-meaning
administrators was itself faulty at the very foundation ;
and the immature graduates of English Universities
who came out to India as custodians of the New
learning were entirety innocent of India&rsquo;s storied past
and the living present. They were quite ignorant of
the dangers of directing the youthful energies of the
children of shastris and pundits into the uncongenial
channels of an alien culture. It was of course impossible for them to impart instruction in the vernaculars. The students were therfore called upon
to do every intellectual work through a foreign
medium. The crushing burden of receiving instruction
through English has been pronounced by competent
authorities to have &quot; atrophied all originality, research,
adventure, ceaseless effort, courage and like qualities.&ldquo;+++(5)+++
But the misfortunes of the student-world did not end
here. The assimination of alien thought at an impressionable period of life is an unsupportable burden. The
influence of Shelleys and Byrons, like that of all narcotics
is at once exhilerating and depressing. It plants alien
ideals into the hearts of the young, without affording
that corrective which a close study of Hindu ideals can
alone give. The deification of Western culture and
civilisation inclines the students to apply the crude
standards of Western materialism to the nobler civilisation of this country. It is thus that the cry of Social Reform has gone forth. The principles of democracy immortalised in the passionate writing and speeches of
Burke, Bright and Gladstone create aspirations difficult of realisation in the cramping political atmosphere
of the country. No wonder that many a graduate has
found his physical strength and endurance severely
taxed in his academical life. The spectacle of hundreds
of bright young men annually leaving the university
portals as physical wrecks is, in no small measure,
due to the circumstances detailed above.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Bal must either have instinctively realized these
dangers or must have found his fragile frame quite in-
adequate to the manifestations of the mighty spirit
within. For, soon after joining the Deccan College he
determined to lay the foundation of that physical
strength and endurance, which, in spite of worries and
hard intellectual work stood him in good stead
during the whole of his life. For full one year,
he neglected his studies and devoted practically all
his time exclusively to physical culture.+++(5)+++ Swimming,
boating and wrestling were his pastimes. Morning and
evening he passed through a severe course of Indian
gymnastics. At the end of the year, he failed in his F. A. examination but he succeeded in his ambition and became a robust young man. Instead of being required
to measure the quantity of his daily food, his powers of
digestion were wonderfully developed. When some years
later, he had an occasion to take food for a few months
in an hotel at Bombay, the manager found him the least
profitable of all customers. He could now stand the
rigours of heat and cold and could with impunity spend
hours together in physical or mental work. Even in
1900, when his health was unsatisfactory and he
could hardly be said to have recovered from the shock
of the prison-life of 1897-98, he swam across the
Ganges — a distance of more than a quarter of a mile.
Once asked the secret of his intellectual tenacity, Mr.
Tilak particularly referred to this period of his youth
and said &ldquo;If one only attends to one&rsquo;s body as one
does to one&rsquo;s mind from the age of 16 to that of 25,
and if the physical strength thus stored up is not
dissipated by gluttony or vice, one can stand any
amount of hard intellectual work till old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This acquisition of health and strenth increased the
buoyancy of his mind and he heartily joined in all the
innocent pranks of College-life. He however knew
where to draw the line between such innocent diversions
and culpable mischief. He also knew how to despise the
mistaken gentility of apathetic natures. His restless
intellect, unfatigued by the rigours of study occasionally
found diversion in heated discussions with his fellow-students.
His outspokenness earned for him the title
of Mr. Blunt. There is nothing paradoxical in the intellectual acuteness and social bluntness of Mr. Tilak.
These qualities can otherwise be named as social and
intellectual &ldquo;directness.&rdquo; No beating about the bush,
but running straight to the subject in hand — that was
his characteristic. His critical faculty had abnormally
developed, and like young George Washington playing
with his axe, he used it on any and every subject that
came in his way. His innate bias for the classical literature of his country, however, saved him from being the
slave of his reason ; and the excesses of the Social
Reformers of the day made him shrink from accepting
their gospel without reserve.</p>
<p>Two professors — Principal Wordsworth and Prof.
Chhatre — of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s College-days stood head and
shoulders above their contemporaries not only by
reason of their profound learning and inimitable
teaching but also by their noble character. Till the
end of his life Mr. Tilak ungrudgingiy admitted the
high moral and intellectual equipment they brought
to their work. They were Gurus in the real sense of
the term.</p>
<p>Out of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s college-companions, Messrs. Mule,
Sharangpani and Kathavte, though not quite so well
known, have, in their own way distinguished themselves.
Others — Messrs. Shridhar Balkrishna Upasani,
Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Vamanrao Apte, Daji Abaji
Khare, Ganesh S. Khaparde, R. N. Mudholkar, Dayaram
Gidumal — need no introduction to our readers. Mr.
(Dr. Sir) N. G. Chandavarkar, too was a contemporary
of Mr. Tilak, though studying in a different college.
He passed his B. A. examination in the same year with
Mr. Tilak (1876). Both Tilak and Chandavarkar secu-
red a first Class in the B. A. examination.</p>
<p>The Mathematical abilities of Mr. Tilak were of the
highest order and were fully and frankly recognised by
Prof. Chhatre who, in those days was considered to be
the premier Mathematician of the Presidency. Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s mathematical training, coupled with his fine
classical study gave his genius that logical and imaginative bent which excites the admiration of the
readers of the Gita-Rahasya and the Arctic Home in the
Vedas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s Sanskrit Studies found recreation in occasional
attempts at versification. Here are a few verses, selected from
one of his Composition Note-Books : —</li>
</ul>

<p>His utter disregard of praise and scholarships was
not due to the perfunctory method of his studies but
rather the reverse. If one were to analyse the prize-
hunters&rsquo; mentality, it will be found that their studies
are not the outcome of a love of knowledge but the show
of it. The one aim of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s life was the acquisition of the intrinsic and so all the rewards resulting from
the attainment of merely marketable knowledge had no
charm for him. His reading was extensive and
thorough ; while reading for examination the history of
the reigns of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, he
studied about a dozen standard authors and made his
own notes.+++(4)+++ While preparing for the LL. B. examination, instead of contenting himself with reading Hindu Law from English writers he went straight to the fountain-head and studied Yajnavalkya and other authorities. He also read all the important Acts passed by the
Government of India since 1827. The closeness of his
application to studies and his ready and prolonged
concentration therein were the wonder of his
friends ; and there was another quality which
is equally, if not still more rare, the innate
purity of his mind. Mr. Upsani, his life-long
friend recalling those three years of Bombay-life
says &quot; I shared Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s room while both of us
were students of Law at Bombay ; and I don&rsquo;t remember a single occasion when he gave expression to any
unworthy thought.&ldquo;+++(5)+++ Happy the youth which, like a
lotus, can grow, unsullied and uncontaminated, in the
muddy water of worldly life and which, the moment it
is full blown is dedicated to the service of the Mother-
land. For such sacred worship, only the freshest, the
most fragrant and unsmelt flowers are necessary. Mr.
Tilak passed his LL. B. in December 1879.</p>

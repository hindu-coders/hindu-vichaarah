  <p>When the author asked me to write out a
foreword when I was in Bombay in the
month of June, I readily consented, because
I thought that he would forget all about it
after I left. But the author is inexorable
and here am I trying to dictate a foreword.</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to say anything about
the late Lokamanya, as I feel overwhelmed
whenever I think of his greatness. Yet his
greatness was so simple. No analysis of his
genius or character is possible because of
that very simplicity. I confess I cannot
analyse his greatness ; I can only say what
has been said from a thousand platforms in
India that he was a man of whom India is
proud.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for me to refer to his love
of country, pride of race, indomitable courage,
unflagging perseverance and spirit of sacrifice
which made his activities so real. All these
are a matter of record in the recent history
of Indian Nationalism.</p>
<p>It has often been said that the Late Lokamanya
was a practical politician and not an
idealist with a vision. I naturally shrink
from an attempt to classify his genius. The
character of a truly great man defies classifi-
cation. I shall relate one little incident of
his life and leave the readers to put what
name they please to his genius. In 1906,
when the Congress was held in Calcutta the
Lokamanya and many of my Maharashtra
friends were my guests. One day during his
visit a gentleman from Lucknow came to
see him. I was present. This gentleman was
a Moderate in politics and began to speak
somewhat angrily. He accused Lokamanya
of creating dissensions in the Congress camp
and said &ldquo;Do you know what the Maho-
medans are doing ? They are combining
against the Hindus and trying to start a
Pan-Islamic movement.&rdquo; Lokamanya&rsquo;s eyes
glistened. He said, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;. This
gentleman got very angry. He said &quot; Sure ?
I am as sure as I am here talking to you. I
have seen some of the letters. Whilst you
are dividing the Hindus, the Mahomedans
are uniting to crush us.&quot; To my surprise,
Lokamanya said with a smile, which it is
impossible for me to describe. &ldquo;Then is
our deliverance at hand. Don&rsquo;t you see the
moment the ^Mahomedans combine, that
moment the Government will be at them.
The moment the Government is at them,
that very moment they will unite with us.&quot;+++(5)+++
It was after this that the Moslem League was
started in open opposition to the I. N. Congress.<br>
It was after this that the Moslem
League strove and worked in perfect unity
with the I. N. Congress. It was after this
that the Hindu-Moslem Unity was declared
a crime in the Punjab. Now we all know.
Was he a practical politician ? Was he an
idealist with a vision ?</p>

<p>#PREFACE</p>
<p>The story of the Life of Lokamanya Tilak
is the history of Western India during the
1 ast forty years ; it is the history of the birth
and growth of Indian NationaUsm, its im-
pact on the Indian Bureaucracy, its vicissi-
tudes, its struggles, disappointments, suc-
cesses and reverses. To attempt a task of
such magnitude, so eminently fit for a philo-
sopher-historian is at any time a &quot; stroke of
temerity.&rdquo; It is still more so at the present
juncture when the ashes of the controver-
sies in which Mr. Tilak so prominently
figured are hot. Though dead, Mr. Tilak
still lives in our midst ; and the time is not
yet for a pronouncement of the final verdict
of History upon him. That is evidently a
work for the next generation when the biographer or historian will be fortified in his
judgment by the knowledge of the ultimate
success or failure of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s methods
and those of his opponents. My task is
comparatively modest ; and though my diffi-
culties are infinitely greater than those of
the future historian, a contemporary biogra-
pher has obvious advantages over him.</p>
<p>Throughout the succeeding narrative, I
have never tried to conceal my bias for Mr.
Tilak. Nor will the reader — Moderate or
Extremist, Brahmin or Non-Brahmin, Indian
or European — expect me to do so. I have
however, to the best of my ability, scrupulous-
ly adhered to truth. Not being closely identified with party principles, personalities and
prejudices, I can claim to have judged Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s opponents sympathetically. I have
as great a regard for Ranade as for Vishnushastri Chiploonkar ; and if in the following
pages the reader finds any lapses from the
standard of fair criticism set by me, he
should unhesitatingly attribute them rather
to an imperfect comprehension of truth than
to any conscious desire of misrepresenting
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s opponents. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s great-
ness is so immense and self-evident that it
stands in no need of any exggeration or
misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The idea of writing a life of the Lokamanya was dimly and vaguely floating in
my mind for a number of years. It recurred
to me again and again when, taking advantage
of the obscurity which hung over his earher
activities, many of his enthusiastic opponents in Western India actively set themselves
to indulge in cheap gibes by irreverential and
by no means fair references to what they
considered to be his mistakes. In this, they
can be pardoned for, being young, these
opponents might have been the dupes of mis-
understandings born in an atmosphere of
party prejudices. But their attacks certainly led me to go beneath the surface of
things and inquire what truth there was in
them. And after three year&rsquo;s patient work,
I find that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s activities, far from
having the shortcomings and inconsistencies
of a political opportunist, have all the well-
sustained unity of a beautiful drama, in
which each scene is organically related to
the preceding and to the succeeding and all
together make one harmonious whole.</p>
<p>It would have been almost impossible for
me to do this laborious work without the
active co-operation of my friends. Their
number is legion. I shall take this oppor-
tunity of thanking only a few of them ; and
if I have to omit individual reference to all,
that is due to the limits of an ordinary pre-
face. Mr. M. R. Paranjpye, Principal of the
Gokuldas Tejpal High School, Bombay, kind-
ly undertook to help me in revising the
work. Mr. Annasahib Sapre and Mr. Karmelkar prepared the Press-copy in an incredibly short time. I must also thank Mr. M. K. David and Mr. Bhausahib Oak for
having helped me in a variety of ways.
Even then I should hardly have hoped of
accomplishing this task but for the sponta-
neous assistance rendered bv Prof. Haribhau
Tulpule, Mr. D. K. Sathe and Mr. Annasahib
Chiploonkar, who during the last ten months
had placed their services entirely at my disposal.</p>
<p>The credit of having supplied the excellent
paper on which this book is published, goes
entirely to Mr. M. R. Joshi, Paper-merchant,
Poona. Mr. Nanasahib Gondhalekar, the
enterprising Proprietor of the Jagaddhitecchu
Press, Poona, must both be praised and thanked for having printed off this book in five
short weeks on his new Monotype machine.</p>
<p>While this Preface was being written, news
has arrived that Mr. C. R. Das, President-
elect of the forth-coming Congress has been
arrested. I must sincerely thank him for
having snatched an odd minute to write a
foreword when his mind was distracted by the
troubles brewing in Bengal.</p>
<p>The unique feature of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s career is
that, like a magnet it draws all. While
the populace claim him as one of their own,
aristocrats recognize that he represented, in
his intellectual and spiritual eminence, a
nobler aristocracy than has fallen to their lot.
Old persons feel interest in the romance of
his career ; the middle-aged derive instruction therefrom. On the younger generation,
the influence of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s life is still deeper.
It not only interests and instructs but inspires the mind to a performance of great
deeds. Like the story of the Pandavas, it is
bound to go down to generations unborn as
an eternal source of inspiration.</p>

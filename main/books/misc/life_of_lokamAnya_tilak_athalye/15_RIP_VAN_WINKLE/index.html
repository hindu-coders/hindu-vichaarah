<p>IVTR. TILAK&rsquo;S transportation to Mandalay was
followed by a long period of political re-action.
Boycott, political or economic, ceased to count as a
iactor in practical politics. Only lord Minto&rsquo;s
&quot; Honest Swadeshi &quot; lived. National schools and
colleges were deserted. The Samitts were sup-
pressed. Arbitration courts collapsed. Whole-
sale repression drove the movement underground,
bringing Terrorism in its train. The Terrorist was
vigorously hunted. Popular leaders found their way
either to goal or to self-imposed exile. The National
Congress with its ever-dwindling enthusiasm and
attendance, met only to register the grosving depres-
sion of the Moderate leaders. The &quot; Reformed &quot;
Councils had disillusioned the people. Even Mr.
Gokhale&rsquo;s optimism was shattered. The Octopeaa</p>
<p>214 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Press Act strangled all freedom of writing. National-
literature was mostly proscribed, especially all that
described Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s personality or preached his
principles. Evidently this was an attempt to make
the people to forget him. <em>&quot; A hush had fallen over
the country. No man seemed to know which way
to move and from all sides came the question * What
shall we do next ? What is there that we can do ?</em> &quot;</p>
<p>On his return to Poona, Mr. Tilak could read this
question on every face. The great Nationalist Party
so laboriously organised by him was thoroughly
routed. People asked themselves the question,
** Would Mr. Tilak take his rightful place as the
leader of the Nationalists or would he, like so many
others, bow to the inevitable and spend the evening
of his life in philosophy and meditation *&rsquo;? The
future of India de})ended on what answer Mr. Tilak-
would give to this question. At a welcome meeting,
held at Poona on Sunday 21st June 1914, he said :—</p>
<p>' When after six year? absence, I return home and
begin to renew my acquaintance with the world, I
find myself in the position of Rip Van Winkle. 1
was kept by the authorities in such a rigorous seclu-
sion that it seemed that they desired that I should'
forget the world and be forgotten by it. However I
have not forgotten the people, and I am glad to
notice that the people have not forgotten me. I can
only assure the public that separation for six
long years could not diminish my love for them and
that I am willing and ready to serve in the satn^'
manner and in the same relation and in the same capa-</p>
<ul>
<li>Uttarapara speech of Srj. Arabindc Ghose (1909).</li>
</ul>
<p>RIP VAN WINKLE ! 2l5</p>
<p>$ity which belonged to me six years before, though
it may be, I shall have to modify the course a little.&quot;&quot;
This declaration gave a quietus to the rumour that
Mr. Tilak &quot; intended to devote the evening of his
life to meditation &quot; and scholarshp. There were
some well-meaning advisers who even urged Mr. Tilak
to retire from Politics and achieve &quot; immortal re-
nown &quot; by writing books like the Gita Rahasya. But
Mr. Tilak knew the mission of his life better. &quot; Lite-
rature and philosophy &quot; he pointed out &quot; are merely
my recreation ; my life-work lies quite in a different
direction.&quot;</p>
<p>In the leaden sky of Indian politics, Mr. Tilak saw
a few gleams of hope. The total failure of the Morley-
Minto Reforms^ the consequent disappointment of
the Moderate party, the awakening of the great
Moslem community and the entry of Mrs. Besant in
Indian Politics, inspired him with great confidence.
His immediate political programme was threefold :
(i) The Congress-Compromise, (2) The reorganisation
of the Nationalist party (3) The setting on foot of a
strong agitation for Home Rule. His leisure was
devoted to the completion and publication (1915) of
the Gita-Rahasya and the consideration of the steps
to be taken against Sir Valentine Chirol for defama-
tion.</p>
<p>Seeing that he had no inclination for a life of learn-
ed retirement, the Bureaucracy tried their hands at
an ' ofQcial boycott ' of Mr. Tilak, and a couple of
police-stations were created in the neighbourhood of
his residence to keep ' a close and rigorous surveil-
lance ' on him. Visitors to his house were * boldly</p>
<p>2l6 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and openly accosted ' and were required to give their
names. If Government servants or persons in any
way connected with the Government called upon
him, they received warnings subsequently. It was
a bare-faced piece of ' political Vendetta ' which had
to be abandoned owing to the outbreak of the great
European war in August 19 14.</p>
<p>A man who had been in goal for over seven years
of his life and who had been persecuted in a variety
of other ways, has every reason to be embittered.
But Mr. Tilak — who combined in himself the qualities
of the soldier and the philosopher — took these troubles
quite lightly, almost as a matter of course. He was
nothing if not chivalrous and high-minded ; so when
the British Government commenced its mortal fight
with Germany he made (27th August 19 14) his &quot; de-
claration of loyalty &quot; — a declaration which extorted
admiration even from hostile quarters. He repudia-
ted the nasty and totally unfounded charges against
him, declared that he had never either directly or
indirectly incited people to deeds of violence, denied
that he had ever worked &quot; with the object of sub-
verting the British rule in India &quot; and concluded by
saying that &quot; at such a crisis it is the duty of every
Indian, be he great or small, rich or poor, to support
and assist his Majesty&rsquo;s Government to the best of
his ability.&quot;</p>
<p>One effect of this declaration was to clear up many
of the cruel misunderstandings that hung like an omi-
nous cloud upon his personality and career. Even the
(nominal) Advocate of India recognized in Mr. Tilak
*' one of our loyalest and truest friends &quot; and called</p>
<p>^IF VAN WINKLE ! 21/</p>
<p>upon his detractors to &quot; admit their mistake and make
at the eariiest possible moment ' the amende honorable.^ &quot;
No wonder that Mrs. Beasant thought this to be a
most opportune moment for bringing together the
much-abused Moderates and the much-persecuted Ex-
tremists. If Sir Edward Carson could suspend his op'
position to the Liberal Ministry and shake hands with
Mr. Asquith, could not Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Tilak
&quot; forget, forgive and unite &quot; in the larger interests of
of the country ?</p>
<p>The negotiations for the Congress Compromise re-
sulted in a temporary failure and form one of the sad-
dest chapters in the history of Maharashtra. x\s fates
would have it, the two great Servants of India — Tilak
and Gokhale — were pitted against each other in a bitter
controversy, the younger had denounced the elder
patriot, and, before the curtain fell on the controversy,
was himself no more (19th February 1915) ; Gokhale,
who began life as a reverent follower of Tilak '' stabbed
him in the dark &quot; and then vanished into eternity !
Oh, the irony of human life !</p>
<p>There was a humorous side, too, to this great tragedy !
Gokhale, on the point of death and Sir Pherozeshah not
far removed from it, afraid to take Mr. Tilak in the
Congress, because, once in, he would capture it !!
&quot; Boycott of the Government &quot; considered to be the
unpardonable sin of Mr. Tilak ! ! The introduction of a
Home Rule Bill in ParUament, through Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
influence with the Labour leaders and the concentra-
tion of all the agitation on that one point regarded as
the approach of deluge ! ! And all this, only six years
before the Congress of 1920 ! ! 1</p>
<p>»«l8 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>In the circumstances of the case, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s party
was naturally anxious to re-enter the Congress-fold,
not only on grounds of national unity but also for the
more narrow reasons of party interests. The great
Nationalist Party, organised by him in the eventful
years of the Swadeshi agitation was, by Government
repression weakened, silenced, disorganised, discredited
and practically routed. As the Congress would be a
great rallying point, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s sincerity in conducting
the negotiations was transparent. Not so, that of the
Moderates, to whom the association with their Extre-
mist brethren was a matter which caused uneasiness
and occasional inconvenience. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta
was dead against the admission of Mr. Tilak with his</p>
<ul>
<li>firebrands ' into the Congress camp and others like
Gokhale had not the courage to go against their chief.
That is why the negotiations fell through.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Constitution and rules of the Congress were
passed (1908) by a Committee appointed by the Conven-
tion (Dec. 1907) from which many Nationalists, willing:
to join it in spite of the evident humiliations,
were deliberately and brusquely excluded. For the
sake of unity, Mr. Tilak was willing to join a Congress-
whose creed (Article No. I) was not quite inspiring, whose
constitution was faulty and whose rules were unreason-
able and arbitrary. But there must be some honour-
able way of returning to the Congress. If Mr. Tilak
wanted to go back to the Congress it must be only as
a delegate elected by some political body recognised by
or affiliated to the Congress.</p>
<p>&quot; The old practice of electing delegates at any public
meeting was set aside and the election of Congress dele-</p>
<p>RIP VAN WINKLE ! 21^</p>
<p>gates was completely and exclusively in the hands &quot; of
the Moderate Associations. ** It was unreasonable to
expect that one party should seek admission to the
Congress through the associations entirely controlled
and managed by the other/' The only course, therefore,
that could bring the Nationahsts in the National Con-
gress was so to amend Article XX of the Congress
Constitution as to enable them to elect their delegates
at public meetings or meetings of Nationalist Associa-
tions. Everything depended on the Moderate leaders*
willingness to alter Article XX of the Congress Con-
stitution in the desired manner.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is soon told.* &quot; Mrs. Besant
accompanied by Mr. Subba Rao, the General Secretary
of the Madras Congress (1914) went to Poona in the
first week of December (1914) and conferred with Messrs.
Tilak, Gokhale and other leading publicists of Poona.
The suggested amendment of Article XX of the Con-
gress Constitution was agreed upon. Then Mr. Subba
Rao went over to Bombay to consult Sir Pherozeshah;
he returned disappointed. Then he met Mr. Tilak, had
a long talk with him, which frightened him as well as-
Mr. Gokhale to whom it was subsequently reported.
Mr. Gokhale was convinced, that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s re-entry
into the Congress Camp would only be a signal for a
renewal of the old struggle. He, therefore, withdrew
his support from the proposed amendment, sent an
oral message to Mrs. Besant accordingly and in reply
to a letter from the President-elect, wrote to him a
confidential letter explaining the reasons of his change
of view. That letter or its re'ised copy &lsquo;became publia</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Amrit Bazat Pairika (12th January 191 5).</li>
</ul>
<p>220 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>property in no time.&rsquo; It was stated in this communi-
cation that Mr. Tilak had openly avowed his intention
of adopting the ' boycott of Government * and ob-
structionist methods of the Irish, if he entered the
Congress. The matter was prominently brought to
the notice of the Subjects' Committee and naturally,
the ears of many of its members were poisoned against
the Mahratta patriot behind his back. In the mean-
time, Mrs. Besant wired to Mr. Tilak to ascertain the
truth or otherwise of the allegation, and not only did
he give a direct lie to it, but said that many of his col-
leagues and followers were actually serving either in
the Legislative Council or in Municipalities and Dis-
trict Boards ! Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s telegram, however, came too
late to mend matters. An apology was, no doubt,
offered to him and charges against him withdrawn but
his enemies triumphed in the end by getting the ques-
tion of reconcilation postponed and a Committee
appointed to consider it.&quot;</p>
<p>It is clear that Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s conhdential* letters to
the President-elect of the Congress spoiled the prospect
of rapproachment between the two parties. Mr. Gokhale
justified his conduct by asserting that his change of
opinion with regard to the Compromise question was
necessitated by Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s conversation reported to
him by Mr. Subba Rao. It was in part as follows : —</p>
<p>&quot; In Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s opinion the present programme of</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. H. P. Mody, in his recently published Life of Sir Phero-
zeshah Mehta has tried to lift the veil from this episode just a
Mttle by giving two extracts from Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s letters. Evidently
these extracts do not exhaust the whole of Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s case
against Mr. Tilak. The venomous parts of the indictment are
apparently still held back.</li>
</ul>
<p>RIP VAN WINKLE ! 22r</p>
<p>the Congress was of no value. They were asking for
small reforms while Mr. Tilak asked his countrymen to
have nothing to do with these. He would make only
one demand, viz, that for self-Go vernment within the
Empire. The Irish, by resorting to methods of ob-
struction, have in the course of 30 years, got Home
Rule. They must also similarly adopt methods of
obstruction within the limits of the law, and then only
would they be able to compel the Government to con-
cede their demands.&quot;</p>
<p>All this came upon Mr. Gokhale as bolt from the blue.
Equally startling to him was the statement of Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s conversation with Mr. Subba Rao. The state-
ment commences thus : —</p>
<p>&quot; The attitude of the Nationalists is generally one of
Constitutional Opposition to the Government ; while
that of the Moderates is that of Co-operation with the
Government. Though the ideal of both is the samej
the difference between them lies in the methods adopted
by them for reaching the goal.&quot;</p>
<p>We leave it to the readers of to-day, to judge whether
Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s change of front could be justified by Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s remarks quoted above. It is interesting to
note that this conversation, which so much disappoint-
ed Mr. Gokhale occurred on December 8th 1914^
after Mr. Subba Rao to whom was assigned the difficult
task of winning over the Bombay City Moderates, had
returned quite disappointed from Bombay. Mr. Subba
Rao has published in the New India (8th Feb. 1915)
a statement in which he said that the Bombay Conven-
tionist leaders were dead opposed to the amendment
proposed by Mrs. Besant and that &quot; great apprehension</p>
<p>222 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>was felt that the Congress would be running a great risk
if Mr. Tilak and his followers came in/' This then was
the real cause of the failure of the compromise
negotiations. For it was not to be expected that Mr.
Gokhale would now continue to support the proposed
amendment of the Constitution, though it was origin-
ally drafted by him.</p>
<p>The Report of the Committee appointed at Madras
to consider the question of the Congress-Compromise
was discussed at the next session of the Congress at
Bombay and a partially satisfactory solution was arrived
at. &quot; Public meetings convened under the auspices
of any association, which is not of less than two yeeirs
standing on 31st December 19 15 and which has for one
of its objects, the attainment of Self-Government by
India on Colonial lines within the British Empire by
Constitutional means &quot; were allowed and as Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
party could now send delegates to the Congress without
looking up to the Moderates for patronage and support
he decided to accept whole-heartedly the grudging and
halting concession. It was high time. A new genera-
tion of Nationalists, willing and eager to sink all differ-
ences, had arisen. The great European War had alter-
ed the whole outlook of the Nation. A demand for a
substantial instalment of Self-government was to be
formulated. It had to be backed up by the strength
of United India. Under these circumstances Mr. Tilak
was not the man to emphasize his differences with his
erring and timid fellow-countrymen. As early as
January 1916, he publicly announced the willingness of
his party to forget the past and re-enter the Congress
through the partially opened door.</p>

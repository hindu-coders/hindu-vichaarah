  <blockquote>
<p>The days of absolute leadership are gone, never to return
back.</p>
<p>N. G. Chandavarkar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere we have traced Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s connection
with the Congress from 1889 down to the early
years of the present century. We have seen, how,
in the period of poUtical re-action, beginning &lsquo;with
1897, the Congress leaders showed their ** states-
manship,&quot; by scrupulously following a policy of
Moderation, which, very often meant inaction, timi-
dity or indifference to the National good.
Ever since his return (1899) ^^ public life after
one year&rsquo;s incarceration,Mr. Tilak had been fighting with
these tendencies in and out of the National Congress.
but what with his pre-occupations in the Tai Maharaj
Case, and what with the small following he had in the
Congress, he could not effectually raise his voice against
the policy of inertia and negation, which Sir Pheroze-
shah later came to glory in. From 1905, however all
this was changed. The wave of awakening in the coun-
try strengthened the nascent New Party and Mr. Tilak
could get that amount of following in the Congress
which was required to put up a fair fight. This tended
to enUven the proceedings of the Congress and increase -</p>
<p>156 # LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>its popularity. Mr. Tilak determined that the Congress
should no longer retain its moribund character. He
resolved that (i) the Congress tradition of seeking
official favour, or at least official recognition must
be broken ; (2) the National sentiments must be
more faithfully echoed in the Congress resolutions ;
(3) The Congress must no longer remain a holiday
gathering, but must work continuously and lead the
National agitations. This was a war between auto-
cracy and democracy, oldage and youth, apathy and
enthusiasm, between timidity and courage. The old
generation tried to win the officials ; Mr. Tilak
sought to inspire and organize the people of the country.
At the Benares Congress (1905) Mr. Tilak got much,
though not all, that he wanted. Sir Pherozeshah, &quot; the
Autocrat of the Congress &quot; was absent ; and the Presi-
dent, Mr. Gokhale, had enthusiastically championed the
Bengalees&rsquo; cause in England and had justified the in-
aguration of the Swadeshi Boycott movement in
speeches which came as a surprise to many of his fol-
lowers. In his Presidential address, he severely criti-
cized the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon, compared it with
the odious reign of Aurangzeb and spoke in favour of
Swadeshi and Boycott. Mr. Tilak wanted separate re-
solutions on Swadeshi and Boycott. The resolution,
justifying the Boycott of British goods, as perhaps the
only constitutional and effective means left to the
Bengalees, was huddled up with the condemnation of
the repressive Policy of the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak
would have liked an independent resolution on the sub-
ject. He wanted the Boycott resolution to go one
step further and call upon the various Provinces of</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II ^ 157</p>
<p>India to prove their sympathy for the Bengalees by
adopting Boycott, but evidently, the Moderates were
not yet prepared to recommend Boycott for aU the
provinces. Mr. Tilak, however, was not discouraged*
The Congress, he said, had broken its tradition by sup-
porting the Boycott and he looked up to the next Con-
gress at Calcutta, to vigourously continue the work so
substantially begun at Benares.</p>
<p>In June igo6, Mr. Tilak paid a visit to Calcutta on
the occassion of the Shivaji festival. Soon after, Babu
Bipin Chander Pal made the proposal that Mr. Tilak
should preside over the Calcutta Congress. This was
the first time in the history of the Congress when Mr.
Tilak &rsquo;s nam.e was seriously proposed for the highest
honour at the disposal of the Nation. Mr. Pal was not
content merely with proposing Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s name. He
carried on a regular campaign. The Moderates were
afraid. Sir Pherozeshah set racking his brains to avert
the &quot; catastrophe.&quot; Babu Surendranath, evidently
smarting under the misrepresentations of the &quot; crown-
ing &quot; incident promised every possible help to the Lion
of Bombay. At last a master stroke was delivered A
cable was sent to Dadabhai Nooroji, the G. O. M. of
India ; it said that the Congress was in danger ; would
Dadabhai return to India and preside over the Congress?
The Cable was despatched by Babu Bhupendra Natb
Basu, the right-hand man of Babu Surendranath.
Without consulting his colleagues, without consulting
the Reception Committee, he took this step, relying
upon Dababhai&rsquo;s innocence and fidelity. Dadabhai
was the last man to shirk help when the Congress was
reported to be in danger. At once he cabled back aa</p>
<p>158 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>affirmative and the Moderates were delighted at having
out-witted the Extremists ; for it was clear that none
would like to contest the honour of the Congress Pre-
sidentship with Dadabhai Nooroji.</p>
<p>But though the question of the Presidentship of the
Congress was thus settled to the satisfaction of the Mode-
rates, the larger question still remained. &quot; Should the
Policy of the Congress be changed ? &quot; (The Hon.) Mr.
Khaparde, after full consultation with Mr. Tilak sent
a Circular letter to leading Congressmen as early as July
(1906) wherein he showed how a radical change had
been necessitated in the programme of the Congress.
The letter attracted considerable attention, specially
in Anglo-Indian quarters. It was feared that the
Congress would go out of the hands of the Moderates
and so Anglo-Indian journals who had abused even
Sir Henry Cotton and Mr. Gokhale as late as 1904 and
1905 respectively, in a sudden burst of overflowing love,
appealed to these very Congressmen not to play into
the hands of the Extremists. Some of the Moderates
themselves were scared away by Mr. Khaparde&rsquo;s letters.
Regarding the main point suggested by the letter, Mr.
Tilak said : — [Kesari nth December 1906).</p>
<p>*' We are sometimes told not to be dis-heartened. If
the Moderates think that we are easily disappointed and
lack grim determination, they are entirely mistaken.
We have lost faith, not in the ultimate result, but in
the dilatory activities of the Congress. To us, the hold-
ing of the Congress for three days in the year, the tepid
work of the British Congress Committee and the
occasional sending of a deputation to England-—
seems quite an insufficient work. • Not that we</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 159</p>
<p>liave no faith in ' Constitutional agitation/ We do
not want to over-throw the Enghsh Government.
Political rights will have to be fought for. The
Moderates think that these can be won by
persuasion. We think they can only be got by strong
pressure. Will the Congress exert itself to apply this
pressure ? That is the point ; and if such a pressure is
to be applied, the Congress must leave this holiday cha-
racter and develop into an organisation working con-
tinuously and energetically.&quot;</p>
<p>All India anxiously awaited to see how the Calcutta
Congress would give its decision on this point. Anglo-
India wanted also to see whether the differences of opi-
nion between the Old and the New Parties would lead
to open and permanent rupture. They wanted the
Extremists to be driven out of the Congress. But this
was an impossibility. In the first place, the Presiden-
tial Chair was occupied by the Angel of Peace. Besides,
Bengal was a strong-hold of the * Extremists ' and in
the Congress session the New Party commanded a
majority. The Presidential address was devoted to the
theme of Swaraj. It, therefore, disappointed the
Englishman vv^hich blamed Dadabhai who &quot; being called
upon to quench the flames of hatred towards the British
Rule in India, had only used kerosine for that purpose.&quot;
Mr. Tilak aided by Babu Bepin Chander Pal organised
a private meeting of the Delegates of the New Party to
discuss the subjects that the Congress should deal with ;
and at this meeting it was decided to get the Congress
adopt three distinct resolutions on (i) Swadeshi, (2)
Boycott (3) and National Education. Of these, the last
was passed by the Subjects' Committee without any</p>
<p>l6o LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>ado. The storm of discussion — hot and acrimonious — &ndash;
centred round the Boycott and the Swadeshi resolu-
tions. At the Benares Congress, Boycott was accepted
as a political weapon but only incidentally, in the reso-
lution on the repressive policy of the Government.
This was merely a flank movement. Mr. Tilak was not
content with it. He wanted to make a frontal attack
and after a prolonged controversy and frequent passa-
ges at arms with Moderate leaders like Sir P. M. Mehta^
he wrung out the words &quot; the Boycott movement was
and is legitimate.&quot; At the Benares Congress it was
only the &quot; Boycott of British goods &quot; that had received
the seal of the Congress. Now, at Calcutta it was not
merely *' economic Boycott &quot; but something more.
Boycott Political. At Benares no general reasons
were given for the acceptance of Boycott. But
at Calcutta, the mistake was rectified ; and the
preamble to the resolution specifically referred
to the fact that Indians had no share in the
administration and that their representations to Go-
vernment went unheeded. There was only one thing
wanting in the resolution. The resolution approved of
the Boycott Movement as started in Bengal ; it did not
urge other provinces to follow suit. But Mr. Tilak
pointed out that neither did the resolution clearly state
that the Boycott was to be confined to Bengal alone.</p>
<p>It is strange but true that in the draft resolution on
Swadeshi, discussed in the Subjects' Committee, people
were not called upon to purchase Swadeshi goods even at
a sflcri^ce; stranger still that when Mr. Tilak brought the
amendment, it was hastily pronounced to have been
defeated. Mr. Tilak demanded a poll, which was re-</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II l6r</p>
<p>fused. As a protest, he had to leave the Subjects'
Committee accompanied, by nearly sixty members in-
cluding distinguished Nationalists like Mr. Pal and
Babu Ashwini Kumar Dutt. Mr. Tilak wanted to move
his amendment in the open Congress. Accordingly he
sent notice thereof to the President, who, at last reali-
sing the strength of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s party accepted the
amendment and bodily inserted it into the main propo-
sition. Discord was thus timely averted and Mr.Tilakj
speaking to the resolution declared that he was pleased
to state that some ideas he favoured had been incorpo-
rated in the resolution ; he further said that he was
glad they had come to such a solution because the
Anglo-Indians had predicted that the 22nd Congress
would probably be the last ; he expressed his satisfac-
tion that all differences had been squared, and that
both the parties had approached the question in a spirit
of conciliation and had met half way.</p>
<p>Summarising the work of the Calcutta Congress, Mr.
Tilak said : —</p>
<p>&quot; The Congress has now in effect laid down that
Swaraj or Self-Govemment is the goal to be ultimately
and gradually attained by the Nation and that, while
the Nation may pray and petition to the Government
as part of the constitutional agitation and seek the
redress of grievances or the fruition of political aspira-
tions, the Nation will mainly rely on its owti endeavours
to accomplish the object. Swadeshi, Boycott, and
National Education are the three most potent weapons
given into our hands by the National Congress, and
with these we must establish Swaraj.&quot;</p>
<p>At Calcutta, Lala La j pat Rai had invited the Congress
11</p>
<p>l62 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>to Lahore. But imagining that Napgur was a safer
place, SirP; M. Mehta got the venue of the next Congress
fixed at Nagpur. It is said that when the Moderate
leaders left Calcutta, it was already arranged that Dr.
Rash Behari Ghose was to be made President at Nagpur.
In the various Provincial Conferences held in the first
few months of 1907, attempts were made to go back
upon the Calcutta Resolutions and thus prepare the
ground for a retrograde step in December. In Bengal,
happily there was no such attempt, as both the parties
were suijiciently advanced and knew the value of unity.
But in the Provincial Conference at Surat, Sir Pheroze-
shah, taking advantage of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s absence, tried to
overawe the &quot; Extremists &lsquo;* and succeded in dropping
the Resolutions on Boycott and National Education.
In the Provincial Conference at Raipur (Berar), there
was a serious dispute over the singing of such an inno-
cent song, as the *&rsquo; Bande Mataram &ldquo;; and it was only
the presence of Mr. Khaparde that compelled the
Moderate leaders to give in. At Allahabad, Pandit
Madan Mohan Malaviya, who in the Calcutta Congress
had declared that his province would not accept Boy-
cott, refused admittance to about 200 Delegates to the
Conference. He put forth the strange plea of inconve-
nience but presumably he wanted to boycott the sup-
porters of Boycott. All these signs showed how the
Moderates were smarting under their &quot; discomfiture &quot;
at Calcutta. At Nagpur, a Conference was held on
January'' 27th, 1907, to appoint the Provincial Commit-
tee which in its turn met on February 22nd to consti^
tute the Reception Committee. The new constitution
of the Congress had practically delegated the work of</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 163</p>
<p>nominating the President of the forthcoming Congress
to the Reception Commitee which by a majority of |
had to select the President. It was, therefore, natural
that the Moderates and the NationaUsts should try to
secure greater representation for their Parties on the
Reception Committee. Each party tried its level best
to secure a majority and on September ist, it was found
that while the Moderates had secured 800 Members, the
Nationalists had got about 1800. Finding that Mr.
Tilak could not be elected President, the Nationalist
gave in only 26 names with-holding the long list of 1800
together with the money (Rs. 45,000) collected at the
rate of Rs. 25 per voter. The Moderates demanded this
money and on the Nationalists refusing to give it, they
proceeded to eject the Nationalist Members from the
Executive Committee. This they had no right to do as
the Executive Committee was already constituted
months back. The Hon. Mr. Chitnavis called a meeting
of the Reception Committee without consulting the
Executive Committee or Dr. Munje, the joint General
Secretary. The meeting (September 22nd, 1907) was a
fiasco and the Hon. convener was the object of a hostile
demonstration on the part of an angry mob. A compro-
mise was attempted. Dr. Gour, himself a Moderate,
proposed that the work of the Congress should begin
with Rs. 20,000 collected by the Moderates from the
800 enlisted members of the Reception Committee
together with a loan of Rs. 5,000 from each party.
The ; Moderates were obstinate. They were unwilling
to allow the NationaUsts single-handed to hold the
Congress Session at Nagpur ; they were unable or afraid
to hold it themselves ; they, therefore, did the easiest</p>
<p>164 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and most inglorious thing ; they reported to the All-
India Congress Committee their inability to hold the
Sessions of the Congress at Nagpur. A meeting of the
All-India Congress Committee was held at Bombay on
November loth, and there, in spite of the protests of
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, in spite of the willingness
of the Nagpur Nationalists to accept any compromise
for the sake of the reputation of their City and Province,
the venue of the Congress was changed to Surat, one of
the strongholds of the Moderates.</p>
<p>Alerady the people were in an angry mood. Repres-
sion was at work in several part of India. Bombay was
comparatively quiet. Far in the South, Rajmahendri,
Cocoanada were seething with discontent. More im-
portant still were the events in the Punjab, where the
mistaken and short-sighted policy of the Bureaucracy
in trying to pass into Acts two Bills — the Colonisation
Bill and the Land Alienation Act Amendment Bill — -
endangered the rights of the people over their lands
and made the discontent acute. The abnormal increase
of Land Revenue in the Rawalpindi District, the in-
crease of the Canal rates on the Bari-Doab Canal, touch-
ed the pockets of even the poorest cultivators and thus
created a grave situation. The Editor and the Pro-
prietor of the Punjabee were prosecuted and in May
1907 Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar Ajit Singh were de-
ported. This deportation created a storm of indigna-
tion and convinced the country of its helplessness in
defending its birth-rights. In Bengal, the Editor of
Yugantar was sent to goil. The Editor of the
Sandhya refused to conduct his defence because &quot; he
did not think that in carrying on the God-appointed</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 165</p>
<p>^anission of Swaraj he was in any way responsible to the
aUen rulers.&rdquo; Babu Arabindo Ghosh was arrested on
a charge of sedition, and on November ist, 1907 the
Seditious Meetings Act was passed, despite the opposi-
tion of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale and of the Hon, Mr. Rash
Behari Ghosh, and it was rumoured that the liberty of
Press was also on the point of being taken away.</p>
<p>On November nth, 1907, Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar
Ajit Singh were released. This news, welcome in each
respect, tended to make the Congress &quot; confusion worse
confounded.&quot; At once, as if by instict, the cry went
round that Lajpat Rai was the fittest man to preside.
At Surat on November 21st, the Reception Committee
was formed and the office bearers of the Congress were
appointed. To prevent many of the Congress-men in
Maharashtra from attending the meeting, it was an-
nounced that the Presidential Election would be made</p>
<p>•on November 24th. Though thus out-manoeuvred, the
young Nationalists of Surat and adjoining places
stoutly suggested the name of Lala Lajpat Rai for the
Presidential post. Mr. Gokhale argued, coaxed, ap-
pealed ; and when every device proved unavailing, he
removed the velvet glove from off his mailed list, and
challenged the younger Nationalists to secure Lala
Lajpat Rai&rsquo;s election in the face of the packed majority
of the Moderates. The Nationalists were in a fix.
They could not allow the Hero of the hour to be humi-
liated by the unworthy tactics of the Moderates. Silent-
ly and sullenly they allowed Dr. Rash Behari Ghose to
be ' unaniomously ' elected President.</p>
<p>The selection of Dr. Ghose for the Presidential chair
-was only part of a wider plan of going back upon the</p>
<p>l66 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>position accepted at Calcutta and of permanentlj??
shutting out the ' Extremists ' from all future sessions-
of the Congress. The Indu Prakash and the Indian:
Social Reformer clearly hinted this purpose and the
whole conduct of the Moderate leaders all over India
in the eventful months of 1907 clearly strengthens this
belief. It was the duty of the Moderates and especial-
ly that of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale who was entrusted
with the work of drafting the resolutions to publicly
declare if this belief was incorrect and unfounded.*
A list of the headings of the subjects likely to be
taken up for discussion by the Surat Congress
was of&amp;cicially published a week or ten days
before the date of the Congress Sessions. This list did
not include the subjects of Self-Government, Boycottp
National Education on all of which distinct and sepa-
rate resolutions were passed at Calcutta in 1906. This-
omission naturally strengthened the suspicion that the.
Bombay Moderates really intended to go back from the
position taken up by the Calcutta Congress in these
matters. The Press strongly commented upon this
omission and Mr. Tilak, who reached Surat on the morn-
ing of the 23rd December, denounced such retrogres-
sion as suicidal in the interests of the countrj^ more,
especially at the present juncture, and appealed to the
Surat public to help the Nationalists in their endeavours.
to maintain at least the status quo in these matters.
The next day, a Conference of about five hundred
Nationalist Delegates was held at Surat under the
Chairmanship of Shrijut Arabindo Ghose, where it was.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are indebted for the bulk of the contents of the next
8 Pages to the closely-reasoned document published by th©-
Nationalist Leaders soon after the break-up of the Congress.</li>
</ul>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 167</p>
<p>decided that the NationaUsts should prevent the at-
tempted retrogression of the Congress by all Constitu-
tional means even by opposing the election of the Pre-
sident, if necessary ; and a letter was written to the
Congress Secretaries requesting them to make arrange-
ments for dividing the house, if need be, on every con-
tested proposition, including that of election of the
President.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, a press-note was issued by the Re-
ception Committee to the effect that the statement that
certain resolutions adopted in 1906 were omitted from
the Congress Programme prepared by the Surat Recep-
tion Committee was wholly unfounded ; but the draft
resolutions themselves were still with-held from the
public ; on the morning of the 25th December, Mr.
Tilak happened to get a copy of the draft of the propos-
ed Constitution of the Congress prepared by the Hon.
Mr. Gokhale. In this draft, the object of the Congress
was thus stated : &quot; The Indian National Congress
has for its ultimate goal, the attainment by India
of Self-Government similar to that enjoyed by the
other members of the British Empire. Mr. Tilak,
addressing a meeting of the Delegates the same morn-
ing, at the Congress Camp, explained how this Consti-
tution was devised to exclude the Nationalists from the
Congress by making the acceptance of this new creed
an indispensable condition of the Congress membership.
Mr. Tilak further stated in plain terms, that if they
were assured that no sliding back of the Congress would
be attempted, the opposition to the election of the Pre-
sident would be withdrawn. The Delegates at the
meeting were asked to sign a letter to Dr. Ghose re-</p>
<p>l68 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>questing him to take up the four old resolutions for re-
affirmation.</p>
<p>Lala Lajpat Rai who arrived at Surat on the morn-
ing of 25th, saw Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde in the
afternoon and intimated to them his intention to ar-
range for a Committee of a few leading Delegates from
each side to settle the question in dispute. Messrs.
Tilak and Khaparde having agreed, he went to Mr.
Gokhale to arrange for the Committee if possible ; and
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde returned to the Nationa-
list Conference which was held that evening. At this
Conference, a Nationalist Committee consisting of one
Nationalist Delegate from each Province was appointed
to earry on the negotiations with the other side ; and it
was decided that if the Nationalist Committee failed
to obtain any assurance from the responsible Congress
Officials about status quo being maintained, the Nationa-
lists should begin their opposition from the election of
the President. For the retrogression of the Congress
was a serious step, not to be decided upon by a bare
accidental majority of any party either in the Subjects'
Committee or in the whole Congress as then constitu-
ted, and the usual acceptance of the President would
have under such circumstances greatly weakened the
point and force of the opposition. No kind of intima-
tion was received from Lala Lajpat Rai on the night
of the 25th, or the morning of the 26th December re-
garding the proposal of a joint Committee of reconcili-
ation proposed by him, nor was a copy of the draft reso-
lutions supplied to Mr. Tilak or any delegates to enable
them to judge if sliding back from the old position was
really intended.</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 169</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th December, Mr. Tilak and
the other Nationalist leaders went to Babu Surendra-
Nath Banerjea at his residence, and informed him that
the Nationalist opposition to the election of the Presi-
dent would be withdrawn if (i) the Nationalist Party
were assured that the Status quo would not be disturbed,
and (2) if some graceful allusion was made by any one
of the speakers on the resolution about the election of
the President, to the desire of the public to have Lala
Lajpat Rai in the chair. Mr. Bannerjea agreed to the
latter proposal as he said he was himself to second the
resolution ; while as regards the first, though he gave
an assurance foi himself and Bengal, he asked Mr.
Tilak to see Mr. Gokhale or Mr. Malvi, the Chairman of
the Reception Committee. A volunteer was accord-
ingly sent in a carriage to invite Mr. Malvi to Mr. Ban-
erjea&rsquo;s residence, but the volunteer brought a reply
that Mr. Malvi had no time to come as he was engaged
in religious practices. Mr. Tilak then returned to his
Camp to take his meals as it was already about 11 a.m.;
but on returning to the Congress Pandal one hour later,
he made persistent attempts to get access to Mr. Malvi
but could not find him anywhere. A little before
2-30 P.M., a word was brought to Mr. Tilak that Mr.
Malvi was in the President&rsquo;s tent, and Mr. Tilak sent a
message to him from an adjoining tent asking for a
short interview. Mr. Malvi replied that he could not
see Mr. Tilak as the Presidential procession was being
formed.</p>
<p>These facts will explain the position of the two par-
lies, when the Congress commenced its proceedings on
Thursday the 26th December, at 2-30 P.M. No assur-</p>
<p>170 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>ance from any responsible official of the Congress about
the maintenance of the Status quo being obtained, Mr^
Tilak sent a slip to Babu Surendranath,initimatingthat
he should not make the proposed allusion to Lala
Lajpat Rai in his speech. He also requested Mr. Malvi
to supply him with a copy of the draft resolutions, if
ready, and about 3. p.m. he got it, though the reporter
of the Advocate of India got it on the previous day.</p>
<p>The Congress opened with the address of Mr. Malvi,
the Chairman of the Reception Committee. After the
address was over, Dewan Bahadur Ambalal Sakarlal
proposed Dr. Ghose to the Chair in a speech, which,
though evoking occasional cries of dissent, was heard'
to the end. The declaration by the Dewan Bahadur
as well as by Mr. Malvi that the proposing and second-
ing of the resolution to elect the President was only a
formal matter, led many to believe that it was not im-
probable that the usual procedure of taking votes on
the proposition might be dispensed with. And when
Babu Surendranath, whose rising on the platform
seems to have reminded many of the Midnapur Con-
ference where he was instrumental in getting the Na-
tionalist party headed by Srij. Arabindo Ghose practi-
cally ejected with Police aid, commenced his speech,
there was persistent shouting and he was asked to sit
down. In spite of his numerous efforts, he could not
go on and so the Session had to be suspended for the
day. It is unjust to suggest that this hostile demons-
tration was pre-arranged by the Nationalists as what
they had decided to do was silently and solidly to vote
against the election.</p>
<p>At about 8 P.M., the late Mr. Chunilal Saraya, Mana-</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 17I</p>
<p>ger of the Indian Specie Bank and Vice-Chairman of the
Surat Reception Committee, accompanied by two other
gentlemen, went in his un-ofhcial Capacity and on his
own account, to Mr. Tilak and proposed that he intended'
to arrange for a meeting that night between Mr. Tilak
and Mr. Gokhale at the residence of a leading Con-
gressman to settle the diSerences. Mr. Tilak agreed
and requested Mr. Chunilal if an interview could be
arranged, to fix the time in consultation with Mr. Gokhale
adding that he (Mr. Tilak) would be glad to be present
at the place of the interview at any hour of the night.
Thereupon, Mr. Chunilal left Mr. Tilak, but no word
from him was received by the latter that night.</p>
<p>On the morning of Friday the 27th, (iia.m.) Mr.
Chunilal Saraya again saw Mr. Tilak and requested him
to go in company with Mr. Khaparde to Prof. Gaj jar&rsquo;s
bungalow near the Congress pandal where, by appoint-
ment, they were to meet Dr. Rutherford, M.P., who
was trying for a reconciliation. Messrs. Tilak and
Khaparde went to Prof. Gaj jar&rsquo;s, but Dr. Rutherford
could not come there owing to other engagements.
Mr. Tilak then decided, as no settlement was arrived
at privately owing to every leading Congressman
being unwilling to take am^ responsibility in the
matter upon himself, to propose that the business of the
election of the President should be adjourned and a
Committee of one leading Moderate and one leading
Nationalist from each Congress Province wdth Dr.
Rutherford&rsquo;s name added, be appointed to consider and
settle the differences existing between the two parties,
both of which should accept the Committee&rsquo;s decision
as final and then proceed to the unanimous election of</p>
<p>172 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>the President. Prof. Gajjar and Mr. Chunilal under-
took to convey the proposal to Sir P. M. Mehta or Dr.
Rutherford in the Congress Camp ; after half an hour
they returned and told Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde
that nothing could be done in the matter.</p>
<p>It was about 12-30 at this time and on the receipt of
the above reply, Mr. Tilak wrote the following note to
Mr Malvi, Chairman of the Reception Committee : —</p>
<p>Sir, — I wish to address the delegates on the proposal
of the election of the President after it is seconded. I
wish to move an adjournment with a constructive
proposal. Please announce me.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,
B. G. TILAK.
Deccan Delegate {Poona).
The proceedings of the day commenced at i P.M.,
when Babu Surendranath was called upon to resume
Ms speech seconding the election of the President.
Babu Surendranath was calmly heard by all and he
duly finished his speech. As Mr. Tilak got no reply to
his note, he sent a reminder. Still Mr. Malvi was
silent. Mr. Tilak, therefore, proceeded to go up the
platform immediately after Babu Surendranath. But
he was held back by a Volunteer. Mr. Tilak, however,
asserted his right to go up and succeeded in getting
to the platform just when Dr. Ghose was moving to
take the President&rsquo;s chair. It is not true that &quot; by
the time Mr. Tilak came upon the platform and
stood in front of the President, the motion of the
election of Dr. Ghose had been passed.&quot; As Mr. Tilak
stood up on the platform he was greeted with shouts of</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II I73</p>
<p>disapproval from the members of the Reception Com-
mittee on the platform and the cry was taken up by
other Moderates. Mr. Tilak repeatedly insisted upon
his right of addressing the delegates and told Dr. Ghose
when he attempted to interfere that he was not pro-
perly elected. Mr. Malvi said that he had ruled Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;samendmentoutof order, to which Mr. Tilak replied
that the ruling, if any, was wrong and that he had a
right to appeal to the delegates on the same. By this
time, there was a general uproar in the Pandal, the
Moderates shouting at Mr. Tilak and asking him to
sit down, and the Nationalists demanding that he
should be heard. At this stage, Dr. Ghose and Mr.
Malvi said that Mr. Tilak should be removed from the
platform ; and a young gentleman holding the impor-
tant office of a Secretary to the Reception Committee
touched Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s person with a view to carry out
the Chairman&rsquo;s order. Mr. Tilak pushed the gentle-
man aside and again asserted his right of being heard,
declaring that he would not leave the platform, unless
bodil}' removed. At this stage, Mr. Gokliale asked the
above-mentioned gentleman not to touch Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
person. But there were others who were seen threat-
ening an assault on his person, though he was calmly
standing on the platform facing the delegates with his
arms folded over his chest.</p>
<p>It was during this confusion that a shoe, hurled on
to the platform hit Sir P. M. Mehta on the side of his
face after touching Babu Surendranath Banerjea, both
of whom were sitting within a yard of Mr. Tilak on the
other side of the table. Chairs were now seen being
lifted to be thrown at Mr. Tilak by persons on and</p>
<p>174 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>below the platform and some of the Nationalists, there-
fore, rushed on to the platform to his rescue. Dr.
Ghose in the meanwhile twice attempted to read his
address but was stopped by cries of * No, No ' from all
sides in the Pandal and the confusion became still
worse. It was now found impossible to arrest the pro-
gress of disorder and the proceedings were then suspen-
ded sine die.</p>
<p>Dr. Ghose&rsquo;s speech, though undelivered in the Con-
gress Pandal, had been by this time published in the
Calcutta papers and telegrams from Calcutta, received
in the evening, showed that in the speech he had made
an offensive attack on the Nationalist Party. This
added to the sensation in the Nationalist Camp that
evening but the situation was not such as to preclude
all hope of reconciliation. Shrijut Motilal Ghose, Mr. A.
C. Mitra, Mr. B. C. Chatterjee and Lala Harkisen Lai
tried their best to bring about a compromise and if
possible to have the Congress Session revived the next
day. They went to Mr. Tilak on the night of the 27th
and the morning of the 28th to ascertain the views of
his party and to each of them Mr. Tilak gave the fol-
lowing assurance in writing : —</p>
<p>SuRAT, 2Sth December, 1907.</p>
<p>Dear Sir ; — With reference to our conversation and
principally in the best interests of the Congress, I and
my party are prepared to waive our opposition to the
election of Dr. Rash Behari as President of the
23rd Indian National Congress, and we are prepared
to act in the spirit of forget and forgive provided, firstly
the last year&rsquo;s resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott
and National Education are adhered to and each ex-</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II I75</p>
<p>pressly re-afi&amp;rmed, and secondly such passages, if any,
in Dr. Ghose&rsquo;s speech as may be offensive to the
Nationalist Party, are omitted.&quot;</p>
<p>Your&rsquo;s etc.,</p>
<p>B. G. TILAK.</p>
<p>This letter was taken by the gentleman to whom it
was addressed to the Moderate leaders but no compro-
mise was arrived at, as the Moderates were all along
bent upon the retrogression of the Congress at any cost.
A Convention of the Moderates was, therefore, held, in
the Pandal, the next day, where the Nationalists were
not allowed to go, even when some of them were ready
and offered to sign the declaration required. On the
other hand, those, who did not wish to go back
from the position taken up at the Calcutta Congress and
honestly desired to work further on the same lines, met
in a separate place the same evening to consider what
steps might be taken to continue the work of the
Congress in future. Thus ended the proceedings
of the 23rd Indian National Congress amidst
confusion and in bitterness, leaving the parties
more estranged than ever, thus making easy the
task of those who were unfriendly to the cause of
Indian freedom.</p>
<p>Let us now examine a little minutely Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
contention, that the Congress autocrats were bent upon
a retrograde step by tampering with the four Calcutta
resolutions, on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott and National
Education. These resolutions had been unanimously
accepted at Calcutta after a long and heated discussion
between the leaders of both the parties. Resolutions</p>
<p>176 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>like these passed as a compromise between two parties
could not be altered even in the drafts by any one only
because that gentleman has been entrusted with the
work of drafting the Congress Resolutions. At the
Calcutta Congress (1906) it was resolved that the sys-
tem of Government obtaining in the Self-Governing
British Colonies should be extended to India ; at Surat
though this resolution was almost repeated still this was
set up as the ultimate goal, evidently meaning that it
was to be considered as out of the pale of practical
politics. What offended the Nationalists still more
was the draft constitution of the Congress in which the
goal of the Congress was defined as follows : —</p>
<p>&lsquo;* The Indian National Congress has for its ultimate
goal the attainment by India of self-government
similar to that enjoyed by other members of the
British Empire * * *. It seeks to advance towards-
this goal b}^ strictly constitutional means, by
bringing about a steady reform of the existing
system of administration * * *.&quot;
So then, the reform of the existing system of adminis-
tration and not its gradual replacement by a popular
system v&lt;^as to be the immediate object of the Congress.
The sting of this seemingly innocent constitution lay
in the fact that it sought to convert the National Con-
gress into a party organisation. As the acceptance of
this creed was the condition of the membership of the
Congress, the Bengal ' Extremists ' who had repudiated
the ideal of Colonial Self-Government were to be shut
out of the Congress. When the goal of the Bengal</p>

by peaceful means&quot; was declared perfectly legal not</li>
</ul>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II V]f</p>
<p>only by the Law Courts* of Bengal but also by Lord
Morley, what right had the Moderates to shut out an
important and law-abiding section of Indian poli-
ticians from the Congress ? Mr. Tilak has been
often blamed for &quot; coquetting with the views
of the Bengal School of Extremist politicians &quot; —
these are Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s words — but though four
or five times at the most, in 1907-08 he has defended
the ideal of his Bengal colleagues and followers y
still he has consistently preached the ideal set up by
Dadabhai Naoroji. If this is to be called inconsistency,
what shaU we say of those who at Calcutta accepted
without demur the National Education Resolution, and
who at the very next Provincial Conference at Surat
declared that they did not understand what National
Education meant ?</p>
<p>The draft resolution about the ' Swadeshi movement *
did not contain the words * even at a sacrifice.&rsquo; Mr.
Gokhale later explained that this omission was * unin-
tentional ' and we readily accept his word but the effect
of this omission was that the very soul of the resolution
was taken out.</p>
<p>Mr. Gokhale has admitted that the changes made by
him in the Boycott resolution were intentional. He</p>
<ul>
<li>As late as 1909, Mr. Beachcroft, the Judge who tried Srj.
Arabindo Ghose and the Maniktola conspirators in the Ahpore
Bomb Case wrote in his judgment &quot; Independence is an ideal
with which no true Englishman would quarrel.&quot; This judicial
pronouncement was specially significant in view of the fact that
Srj. C. R. Das, Counsel for Srj . Arabindo Ghose had repeatedly
declared on behalf of his client that if preaching independence
was a crime, Srj. Ghose was willing to suffer any punishment
that might be awarded to him.</li>
</ul>
<p>178 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>declared that they were rendered necessasy by the
unfair and unjustifiable attempt made by Bapu Bepin
Chunder Pal from the Congress platform in 1906 and
by Mr. Tilak and others in the Press throughout
1907, to construe the phraseology employed in the
Calcutta resolution as approving Boycott of all forms
of association with the Government. Now, what
is the exact wording of the Calcutta resolution ?
After recounting the reasons, the Congress declared
that &quot; the Boycott movement inaugurated in Bengal
was and is justifiable.&quot; Mr. Gokhale in his draft
resolution changed the wording from *' Boycott
movement &quot; to the &quot; Boycott of foreign (British)
goods.&quot; As Babu Bepin Chunder Pal said &quot; We in
Eastern Bengal and Assam have not only tried to
boycott British goods , but all honorary offices and
association with Government &quot; and the words' 1&quot; Boy-
cott Movement&quot; were comprehensive enough to include
these phases of Boycott while the wording adopted by
Mr, Gokhale was evidently narrow.</p>
<p>Regarding the last resolution, the Calcutta Congress
said &quot; the time has arrived for the people earnestly to
take up the question of National Education * * and to
organise a system of education * * on National lines
and under National control.&quot; Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s draft
concluded with the words &quot; organize an indepen(^ent
system of education,&quot; thus leaving the very vital words
&quot; on National lines and under National control.&quot; Mr.
Gokhale might have thought that verbal changes were
made here and there to remove ambiguity or to improve
the phraseology. Is it not, however, wiser to retain a
phraseology, however defective from the literary stand-</p>
<p>TILAK ANO THE CONKPFSS — II I79</p>
<p>point than endanger the peace and harmony of the
Congress ? But if these changes were really vital — as
has been clearly shown — is it not proper to put the
whole responsibility of the Surat episode on the heads
of those Congress autocrats who, for the sake of a petty
scheme of administrative reforms were willing to dis»
card the friendship of their political colleagues and
create a situation which made it easy for the Bureau*
cracy to &quot; make short work of the Extremists &ldquo;?</p>

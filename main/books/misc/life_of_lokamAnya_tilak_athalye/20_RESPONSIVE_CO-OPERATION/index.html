  <blockquote>
<p>Not what thou and I have promised to each other but what
the balance of our forces can make us perform to each other :
that, in so sinful a world as ours, is the thing to be counted
upon.</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Mr. Montague asked Mr. Tilak what he would
do in case the reforms fell short of his expect-
ations, Mr. Tilak readily replied &ldquo;I would accept what is
given and fight for more.&ldquo;+++(5)+++ Being a strategist and not
a mere idealist, Mr. Tilak knew full well how to make
use of the smallest concessions. That is why, when
the Montague-Chelmsford report was out,he did not run
into hysterics over it. He never called for its unquali-
fied rejection. From the very beginning his criticism
was strong but constructive and he refused to lend the
weight of his support to that small party in the Congress
which in July and August, 19 18, talked of a summary
refusal of the &lsquo;little&rsquo; Mont-ford gift. It was not, there-
fore, likely, that Mr. Tilak would, in November 1919
reject those Reforms which nearly two years back he
had decided to accept for a time. When he returned
to India in November 1919 after advocating the Congress
demands before the British Democracy, he had already
matured in his mind a plan of operations, which he
thought, would be the shortest cut to Home Rule.
When in England, Mr. Tilak had been deeply impres</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK ' 29X</p>
<p>-sed with the completeness with which Sinn Feiners had
carried the General Election of 19 18. The Sinn Fein-
ers* refusal to take their seats in the Parliament, their
efforts to organize a Government of their own, strongly
appealed to him. Of course, he saw the limitations
under which they were working and the difference bet-
ween the conditions in Ireland and those in India. An
adoption of the peaceful portions of the tactics of the
Sinn Feiners, in the more favourable circumstances of
India, with her large size, her distance from England
and her countless millions, would, he was convinced
bring greater pressure on our rulers, and compel them,
in spite of their hesitation and caution, to revise the
Government of India Act in the shortest time possible.
Mr. Tilak had no mind to allow things to drift or leave
them for an uncertain futurity to decide. &lsquo;* Now and
here &lsquo;* the question must be satisfactorily and finally
solved. No tinkering, no tardy instalments, no humili-
ating examinations could be tolerated.
t&rsquo;j&rsquo;The immediate task before him, on his return from
London, was, so to organise public opinion as to give a
definite verdict on the Government of India Act.
There was barely one month. He consulted his friends
and associates in other parts of India. Very little dan-
ger of opposition was anticipated. The little content-
ment or rejoicing that existed was to be found only in
the Moderate circles. The redoubtable Mrs. Besant
was, of course, expected to put up a strong fight ; but
she was working hopelessly against the tremendous
force of the national sentiment and was bound to be
worsted in the fray. Soon after the passing of the
Government of India Act, was issued the Royal Procla-</p>
<p>292 ' • RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION &quot;</p>
<p>ndation, so singularly noble in sentiment, so eloquent ii*
style. It was calculated to rouse the imagination and
evoke the gratitude of India. No doubt, Mr. Montague
meant well by India and his appeal had the ring of sin-^
cerity. But the days of miracles are gone and Mr.
Tilak knew full well that the magic wand of the Royal^
Proclamation would not, all of a sudden, transform the
mentality of the governing class of India. He, there-
fore, publicly expressed his gratitude for the Royat
message and promised responsive co-operation.</p>
<p>On the saintly and chivalrous mind of Mahatma
Gandhi, the Royal Proclamation had a far different
effect. He believed the message to be a distinct depar-
ture from the narrow lines of policy hitherto laid down
and calculated to usher a new era in the national life
of India. He. therefore, wanted to welcome the mes-
sage without any reservations. He was strongly sup-
ported by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Pandit
Motilal Nehru.</p>
<p>At Amritsar, where the Congress met, a triangular
fight was expected. There was enough courage or
enthusiasm at the meeting. The question that occured
to a thoughtful mind was &quot; Would there be the neces-
sary amount of tact, shrewdness and foresight which the
occassion demanded ?&rdquo; Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s presence and
arguments infused moral sublimity into the proceedings
as was seen by the Resolution which condemned the
excesses (April 19 19) of the infuriated mobs in the
Punjab and other places. The question was whether
the Congress would rise to the same height of statesman-
ship as it did to that of moral sublimity. What should
be the wording of the resolution about the Reforms ?</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK i 293</p>
<p>Mrs. Besant&rsquo;s proposal, had it been passed, would have
emphasized our expression of gratitude at the expense
of our dignity. Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s resolution was graceful
without being emphatically dignified. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s re-
solution was a unique combination of grace with dignity,
mellowed by a reasonable expression of gratitude. It
was not a question merely of grace or gratitude. The
Resolution, Mr. Tilak said, ought not to tie our hands.
We must emphatically state that we are fit for an im-
mediate establishment of Home Rule. We must em-
phatically state that we are not satisfied with what has
been given. We must fully reserve our right to carry
on a vigorous agitation for a very early revision of the
Government of India Act. We must carry on our propa-
ganda in other parts of the world and convince the
different nations of the legitimacy of our demands.
If the Resolution is too complimentary, if it talks too
much of gratitude and satisfaction, how shall we, say
next year, appeal to the British Democracy, to revise
the Act ? This, in brief, was Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s reasoning.
In the draft Resolution &quot; Mr. Das reiterated the de-
mands of the Delhi Congress and declared that the
Reforms Act is inadequate, unsatifactory and disappoint-
ing. Mr, Gandhi&rsquo;s argument was that those who label-
led the Reforms Act as disappointing could not be
expected to use the same for the early estabhshment of
Responsible Government in India. Disappointment
and work could not go hand in hand. He appealed to
Mr. Tilak, the commentator of the Gita, to solve the
riddle and have no mental reservations towards those
in England who were well-disposed towards India.
Mr. Tilak replied that disappointment should not be</p>
<p>294 *&rsquo; RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *&rsquo;</p>
<p>the reason for keeping oneself aloof from or boycotting the
Reforms Act ; nay, the Gita enjoins us to accept the
hievitable and work under distressing circumstances
with a clear sense of duty. After a lively discussion
lasting for nearly five hours in the open sessions, Messrs.
Gandhi, Das, Tilak, Pal, Malaviya come to a compro-
mise &quot; and the Resolution concluded declaring that
India should work the Govermnet of India Act so as to
secure the early establishment of full responsible govern-
ment.</p>
<p>In supporting the Resolution, Mr. Tilak made an ex-
cellent speech. He concluded it in the following signi-
ficant and statesmanlike words : —</p>
<p>&quot; We want now clearly to declare, not only here but
to the whole world that we are not satisfied with the
Act. We want to continue our agitation. We want
to utilize it to our best advantage and continue to de-
mand more and we want the rest of the world to know
that this is the exact state of things. Do not mislead
the civilized nations of Europe. Take care of that.
Do not be too generous, too humane to accept with
fulsome glee what little has been thrown to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce controversies at the Amritsar Congress
threw Mrs. Besant into an unnatural alliance with the
Moderates ; and the next few months are thick with con-
troversial dust. It is really painful to see the great lady
trying to harp on the innocent statement of Mr. Tilak
&quot; Diplomacy must be met with diplomacy.&rdquo; Mrs.
Besant complained of being used as a tool by Mr. Tilak,
called him a menance to India and reported him as
having said to a prominent member of the Moderate
Party &quot; I deliberately misrepresent the Moderates; that ia</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK 295</p>
<p>Politics.&rdquo; All this was probably the result of her dis-
appointment and discomfiture at Delhi (1918) and at
Amritsar (1919). Her conduct in England was severely
criticised by Messrs. Khaparde and Patel and her at-
tempts to persuade Labour leaders not to move Con-
gress amendments were brought to light. This exaspe-
rated her beyond all measure and she appealed to the All-
India Congress Committee to disassociate itself from the
utterances of Messrs. Patel and Khaparde. This appeal
was made when Mr. Patel had already sailed for
England. So Mr. Tilak had to take the sword in his
behalf and do an unpleasant duty. It is well to cast
a veil over all these controversies; for nothing pained Mr.
Tilak more than the attitude of Mrs. Besant, who, he
always held, was by temperament never a moderate.
He had publicly appealed to her (March 1920), iu the
best interests of the country to co-operate with the
Congress Party. But God had willed it that her path
should differ from that of the Congress leaders.</p>
<p>The Moderate Party, with its age-long opposition to
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s principles and personality was led in Maha-
rashtra by the Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Paranjpye, who, with true
iconoclastic fervour, started his new campaign against
the Nationalists by striking at their idol. When, there-
fore, an address was proposed to be given at Poona to
Mr. Tilak on his return from England (November 1919),
Mr. Paranjpye opposed it by publishing &quot; a catalogue
of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s sins of commission and omission.&rdquo; The
attack failed ; the address was duly given and though
Mr. Parajpye was challenged to personally lead the op-
position at the public meeting, he wavered at the last
moment and remained absent.</p>
<p>296 &quot; RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>»</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Moderates realized, though a little late that oppo
sition to an address to Mr. Tilak would bring both defeat
and bad repute ; their chivalry and decency would be
questioned. But the sentimental cry of simulta-
neous compulsory education to the boys and girls of
Poona was catching. It did not matter that the tax-
able capacity of the Poona City Municipality did not
allow an additional annual burden of Rs. 86,500. It did
not matter that even in Western countries, when on
economical grounds a choice had to be made, the com-
pulsory education of boys usually preceded that of the
girls. It did not even matter that Mr. Gokhale, the
great apostle of moderation wanted to give free and
compulsory education to boys first and to girls after-
wards. The Moderates simply wanted to enjoy a little
fun at the expense of the Nationalists who were in a
majority in the City Municipality. The law demand-
ed that the opposition must not exceed one- third of the
total number of members. Taking advantage of this
provision, the Moderates, &quot; in defiance of precedence,
prudence, practical wisdom and financial knowledge &quot;
of their own city were willing to see the education of a
large number of boys neglected, because their oppo-
nents, the Nationalists could not guarantee the immediate
education of all the girls in the city on account of
financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The Moderates&rsquo; concern for the free and compulsory
education of girls at Poona was equalled by their keen
desire for the free and unrestricted admission of peasant
delegates to the Poona District Conference held at
Junnar early in March (1920). Knowing that they
would be in a minority at the Conference, the Moderates,</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK 297</p>
<p>who at their Conferences held at Bombay and Calcutta,
had never thought of this concession, began to harp on
this favourite string. Without even a week&rsquo;s notice to
the Reception Committee, they wanted to have a num-
ber of &quot; Peasant Delegates &ldquo;, secretly pledged to vote
for them. But the Committee allowed only five &quot; Pea-
sant Delegates &quot; to each Taluka. The result is curious.
Not even five peasant delegates repsonded to the call
and the Conference was a signal triumph of Mr. Tilak
and his party.</p>
<p>Through the thick clouds of all these controversies,
Mr. Tilak was hacking his path to the goal. An old
acquaintance of the unrepentent Indian bureaucracy,
he cleariy knew, what even a less experienced man has
observed that we &quot; are dealing with the most astute and
diplomatic and clever set of politicians in the worid and
that they could undo what the Secretary of State has
done.&rdquo; He had noted how tardily the Bureaucracy had
responded to the gracious Royal Proclamtion and how
incomplete was the amnesty to political prisoners. He
had also noted how the Congress party was rigorously
excluded from the Advisory Committee on Rules under
the Government of India Act. But the position he had
taken from the beginning was one of responsive co-ope-
ration and he was not required to change it. In a
speech at Bombay he said : —</p>
<p>&lsquo;* We are prepared to co-operate ; but if there is
nothing to co-operate, we shall not. * * His
Majesty has asked the people and the authorities
to co-operate with each other. * * * * It is
almost a scandal to say that Indians are not pre-
pared to co-operate for the sake of India ; obey-</p>
<p>298 &ldquo;responsive co-operation&rdquo;</p>
<p>ing His Majesty means in India loyalty to bureau-
cracy first and to people afterwards. * * Let
the authorities declare in what ways they are
prepared to co-operate with us and we can
assure them that, if they co-operate with us, we
can, with them. Co-operation is mutual</p>
<p>»»</p>
<p>Meanwhile, events of far greater import than party
squabbles or recriminations were happening with shock-
ing rapidity. The imposition of an unjust, inequitable,
humiliating and crushing peace on Turkey, in defiance
of repeated pledges, in defiance of the feeUngs of Indian
Moslems set aflame the Islamic mind in this country.
The recklessness with which the sacredness of pledges
was disregarded produced the deepest impression on the
mind of Mahatma Gandhi and his moral nature revolted
against an order of things which rendered possible such
brutal callousness. The Privy Council Judgment in
the Am ri tsar case dealt &quot; a severe blow to our constitu-
tional rights, investing the Viceroy with almost auto-
cratic power of ordinance-making.&rdquo; It showed how
** the judgments even of the highest tribunals are not
unaffected by political considerations.&rdquo; The belated
publication of the belated report of the belated Hunter
Commission aggravated the situation by showing how
the majority of the Commissioners considered cold-
blooded murders to be mere &quot; grave errors &quot; and
** unfortunate &quot; or &quot; injudicious &quot; acts. The Viceroy
condoning the sins of the notorious Satrap of the
Punjab, the Secretary of State applauding Lord
Chelmsford, the House of Lords in love with
General Dyer, — all this was too much even for the most</p>
<p>LOKAMANVA TILAK 299</p>
<p>forgiving of all morteils ! As gentle as a lamb, as for-
giving as an angel, Mahatma Gandhi could not yet
endure the flagrant injustice of the Simla autocrats ;
and he determined to unsheathe the sword of non-co-
opera ton with the ultimate object of bringing round
the up-holders of this unrighteous poUcy.</p>
<p>Mr. TUak cordially welcomed the rise of this luminary
in the firmament of Indian Pohtics ; and as regards
non-co-operation, Mr. Tilak was a non-co-operator since
the very beginning of his career. He had set his
back on Government service and had not cared to prac-
tise as a pleader in the Government courts ; he had
given eleven years of his life to the attempt of nation-
alizing education and had left the Deccan Education
Society when he found his task impossible. So far,
therefore, as the first stage of Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s pro-
gramme went, Mr. Tilak had put into practice most of
the items included therein. As regards the remaining
three stages, Mr. Tilak would never have shirked advo-
cating them had he found it necessary in the circumstan-
ces of the country. There was only one item to which
he was strongly opposed, and that was the boycott of
the Councils. This he considered suicidal. He could
not be suspected of being specially enamoured of the
Councils as most of the prestige which he commanded
was due, not to his short membership of the Bombay
Legislative Council but to his work outside the Council.
Besides, owing to age and loss of vigour he had almost
decided not to stand for election. He was however em-
phatically of opinion that in the agitation to be started
for a very early revision of the Government of India Act,
it was necessary to capture most of the seats in the Coun-</p>
<p>300 &quot; RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION &quot;</p>
<p>cils. He differed from Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s opinion that
the Councils are a snare and that there is an insidious
poison which invariably affects its members. Mr. Tilak
admitted that this was true when we were in a substan-
tial minority in the Councils but he held that no danger
need be anticipated when the Nationahsts would enter
the Councils not necessarily to co-operate. The most
aggressive and effective form of non-co-operation would
be non-co-operation within the Councils and on this he
had set his heart.</p>
<p>That is why at the Sholapur Provincial Conference
(April 2nd, 3rd and 4th), he laboured to carry a resolu-
tion which called upon the Congress Committees in par-
ticular and the public in general to *&rsquo; accept the lead
given by the Amritsar Congress, in the matter of the
working of the Reforms Act, and support, at the ensuing
Council elections, the candidature of persons whose
allegiance to the Congress is beyond all question.&rsquo;&rsquo; The
bewitching cry of &quot; elect the best men &quot; was raised by
the minority. Mr. Tilak agreed ; but explained that
the men to be elected must be best for the purpose in
view, namely the working of the Reforms Act so as to
attain full Responsible Government within the shortest
time possible. He was in no sympathy with best men
who would merely like to work the act without this
particular end in view. If we really went in for best
men, why, in the bureaucratic fold, many capable per-
sons might be found; but the}&rsquo; were not wanted, nor tha
Moderates, if they did not respect the Amritsar Resolu-
tion. This was too much for the Moderates, who had
tried their best to attend the Conference in large num-
bers, though in trying to secure numbers, they had to</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA tiLAK 30 r</p>
<p>leave aside principles and get elected through &quot; the
Deccan Sabha of Poona, hundreds of men of Sholapur,
as Poona Delegates including known minors, and people
of doubtful credentials and suspicious characters.&rdquo;
Mrs. Besant had come all the way from Madras to get
the Amritsar judgment reversed ; she moved an amend-
ment which would have enabled the Moderates to stand
for election in the name of the Congress and through
the help of the Congress ogencies. But the amend-
ment was defeated by an over- whelming majority.</p>
<p>Within a fortnight after the close of the Sholapur
Conference, Mr. Tilak published the manifesto of the
&quot; Congress Democratic Party.&rdquo; Though he published
this document over his signature, still he had consulted
most of the Nationalist leaders in Western India, and
it was merely to save valuable time that he thought it
desirable to publish it on his individual responsibility.
Those who know that Mr. Tilak wanted to place the
manifesto for approval before the Special Congress at
Calcutta, will not blame him for having acted autocra-
tically in the name of the Congress Democratic Party.
The Manifesto is a comprehensive document, by no
means exhaustive ; it lays down the general policy of the
advanced poUtical party. The Manifesto declares : —
&quot; This Party proposes to work the Montague Re-
forms Act for all it is worth, and for accelerating
the grant of full Responsible Government ;
and for this purpose it will, without hesitation,
offer co-operation or resort to constitutional op-
position, whichever may be expedient and best
calculated to give effect to the popular will.&rsquo;&rsquo;
What was the object of issuing this Manifesto ? Some</p>
<p>302 RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *&rsquo;</p>
<p>unfriendly critics think that Mr. Tilak was pressed —
nobody knows, by whom — to declare his programme
and was required to show some constructive work as his
name was associated with mere destruction. Others
hold that it was a set off against Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s
programme of Non-co-operation published about this
time. There are persons who seek to justify Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
Manifesto by pointing out that the publication of the
Congress Democratic Party&rsquo;s Manifesto was followed by
the publication of at least half a dozen similar docu-
ments from different groups of politicians in India.
The truth is that the manifesto of Mr. Tilak forms only
a link in the work of organisation required for carrying
the Councils elections, on which Mr. Tilak had set his
heart. The first step was, of course, the Amritsar Re-
solution. The Sholapur Conference which followed,
developed the Amritsar Resolution, and specified the
persons eligible for election under the Congress banner.
The Manifesto followed, pointing out at length, the
scope of the work of the Congress Party. The fourth
step was taken when at the Annual Conference of the
Indian Home Rule League, the services of the League
were placed at the disposal of persons belonging to the
Congress Democratic Party and desirous of standing as
candidates for Councils. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s next idea was to get
the Congress Democratic Party&rsquo;s Manifesto approved of
by the Special Session of the Congress at Calcutta.
He intended to make this Congress concentrate upon
the elections in November 1920 ; and then, after having
established an over- whelming majority in the Councils,
he intended at Nagpur to give an ultimatum to the
Bureaucracy. Had the Bureaucracy failed to respond^</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA HLAK 3O3</p>
<p>the Nationalists&rsquo; majority would have absented itself
from the councils or taken to other forms of opposition
which would have brought the Bureaucracy to their</p>
<p>knees.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this programme was not at all
inconsistent with the acceptance of Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s.
Indeed, it seems certain that both the Mahatma and the
Lokamanya would have fused their programmes into
one. Had Mr. Tilak lived, the whole of Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s
programme and not merely its first step, would, very
probably, have been accepted by the Calcutta Congress,
with the proviso, that the Councils were not to be boy-
cotted. The Nation would thus have been able to wage
a battle royal with the Bureaucracy — ^within and out-
side the councils, the one helping the progress of the
other ; and the sad spectacle of the Bureaucracy trying
to crush the Non-co-operators with the aid of the Mode-
rates in the Councils, would never have been seen.
Had repression come, it would have appeared hideous
in all its nakedness.</p>

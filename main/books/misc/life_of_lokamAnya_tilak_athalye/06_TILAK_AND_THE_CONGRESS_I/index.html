  <blockquote>
<p>At the Poona Congress of 1895, when Gokhale was a secretary
of the Reception Committee, the ridiculous controversy started
by Mr. Tilak, about letting the Social Conference have the use
of the Congress Mandap assumed disproportionate dimensions
and Mr. Tilak triumphed momentarily. I do not know what
he now (1915) thinks in his heart of hearts of the part, that he
played in the matter, though he can, like the skilful advocate
that he is, still put a fair complexion on it is necessary.</p>
<p>R. P. Paranjpye</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nPHESE words, coming from the pen of a responsible
Moderate leader show to what length party misunder-
standings and party misrepresentations can go. To a
certain type of people, Mr. Tilak has always appeared as
the evil genius of the Congress, creating trouble, foment-
ing dissensions, recklessly courting Government wrath
and leading the nation to the verge of disaster. They
sum up Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s contribution to the Congress cause
by mentioning the controversies at the Poona Congress
and the fiasco at Surat. Only history will show how
Mr. Tilak popularised the Congress movement during its
infancy, how for that purpose his co-operation was
sought, though his person was disliked, how he tried to
infuse fresh blood into that body when the original</p>
<ul>
<li>firebrands ' were degenerating into apathy, how he</li>
</ul>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 65</p>
<p>failed, how matters culminated in the unfortu-
nate spUt at Surat, how the Congress dwindled
into nothingness, and how Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s return (1916)
to the Congress camp enhanced its prestige, power
and popularity, until at last in the present moment
it has been recognised as the non-of&amp;cial ParUament
of the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak joined the Congress in 1889, — only after his
separation from the Deccan Education Society had be-
come ine'itable and imminent. &quot; One thing at a time &lsquo;*
was always his motto. If he sacrificed Social Reform
to Politics, let us not forget that in the first
ten years of his career he sacrificed Politics to
Education. The principle of division of labour, in-
troduced mainly by Mr. Tilak into our public Hfe
has at last been accepted and no man is now
blamed for confining his attention to a particular
branch of national acti\dties.</p>
<p>The question is often asked &quot; WTiy was not Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
name even proposed for the Presidentship of the Con-
gress earlier ?&quot; His genius, learning, courage and sacri-
fices were generally admitted. What then came in his
way ? If Mr. Tilak was a junior, was not Mr. (Now
Dr. Sir) Chandavarkar equally so in 1900 ? The answer
is that the group of the politicians who held the Congress
in leading strings was rather exclusive and would not
agree to admit into the inner sanctuary an element of an
alien type. The qualities that then were considered to
belong to a statesman were eloquence of speech, supp e-
ness of conduct, European habits and association (mis-
named influence) with the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak had
none of these ' rare ' gifts. He possessed in a boundless
5</p>
<p>66 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>measure the &lsquo;&lsquo;too coommon** qualities, — fixity of pur-
pose, inflexibility of will, boundless courage and enthu-
siasm, lofty idealism and tremendous earnestness. In
the midst of holiday poUticians claiming monopoly of
wisdom and statesmanship, he was an impracticable
enthusiast, to be tolerated as an unavoidable evil. His
superabundant energies were fully utilized and six suc-
cessive Provincial Conferences (all of them, except two
held at Poona) were organised by him and by Mr.
Namjoshi. But in the agenda of resolutions only a
back seat was given to him and he was very rarely given
the opportunity of moving important resolutions in the
Congress. Mr. Tilak who cared more for work than
for honour and display cheerfully did the part of
the work entrusted to him. If the credit of popu-
larising the Congress work in Maharashtra can be
claimed by any one, it can be by Mr. Tilak. The
Congress itself was an institution after western models ;
its&quot;; leaders, so far at least as the land of the Marathas
was concerned, were chiefly Government servants
and pensioners, titled nonentities and self-seeking
youngsters. Add to this; the controversies in con-
nection with the Age of Consent BiU, Sharada Sadan
and . the Hindu-Mahomedan riots, controversies in
which Mr. Tilak had to take a definitely hostile atti-
tude towards the Reformers of the day. StUl, at the
call of the Congress, he threw aside his opposition to
those people, and year in and year out, appealed to the
general public to follow its lead aud strengthen it by
moral, intellectual and financial support. Had Mr.
Tilak been the narrow-minded bigot he was represented
to be he would never have supported the Congress Pro-</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 67</p>
<p>paganda, headed that it was by most of tlie reformers
and risked his popularity with the masses by
championing a body which utilised his energy and
abiUty but which showed very httle recognition of his
ivorth. All these circumstances must carefully be
remembered if we would correctty understand the tangle
of the Poona Congress (1895).</p>
<p>The real question before the Poona pubUc of 1895 was
not whether the Social Conference of that year should,
according to the usual practice have been allowed to
be held in the Congress Mandap; for had this been the
real question at issue &quot; the ridiculous controversy &quot;
said to have been &quot; started by Mr. Tilak &quot; would at
once have been settled by Mr. Ranade&rsquo;s graceful and
timely declaration that the Social Conference, which in
truth was attended only by a small fraction of the
Congress delegates and visitors would be held in some
other place. When there is a childish dispute over a
trifle, all the parties concerned are responsible, if it
assumes &quot; disproportionate dimensions.&quot; The question
of holding or not holding the Social Conference in the
Congress Pavilion was only a move in the bigger game,
the deep-laid plot, of discrediting Mr. Tilak and humilia-
ting him in the eyes of the Poona pubhc and of the
Congress at large. Nobody will say that the petty
motives of jealousy which moved lesser men inspired
leaders like Ranade. It will, however have to be
admitted that had Ranade risen to the full height which
the occasion demanded much heart-burning would have
been avoided. But he was powerless to assert his will
against the clique that surrounded him. It was humour-
ously called &quot; The Tilak Persecution Society.&quot;</p>
<p>68 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Looked at, from an impersonal standpoint, the differ-
ences between Tilak and Ranade have been summarized
by the former as follows : —</p>
<p>&quot; Every one*, whether orthodox or heterodox, refor-
mer or reactionary should join in and support the
Congress movement. A Congress in Poona cannot be
regarded a success unless the majority of the people in
Poona join it enthusiastically. We must approach the
trader, the artizan and the working man as well as
the educated classes and make all of them subscribe
to the Congress fund and in order to do this
we must appeal to each of them in a manner, so
as not to offend their susceptibilities unnecessarily.
The Congress eventually aims at being a Con-
gress of the people and the object cannot be
achieved, unless, every year, an effort is made to
approach more and more the classes that have not
taken hitherto much interest in the movement. * =^&rsquo; *
If the masses are drawn to the Congress, it is possible
that they may not lend their support directly or indirect-
ly to the cause of the Social Conference. It is this
apprehension that makes the friends of Social Reform
restrict the scope of their work for the Congress within
a safe narrow circle. ^ ^ One (party) wishes to draw
to the Congress as large a portion of the public as it
possibly can, irrespective of the question of Social
Reform : the other does not wish to go much beyond the
circle of the frionds of reform. &quot; * * The real point of
issue is whether '&rsquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;-&rsquo; the Congress in Poona is to be a
Congress of the people or of a particular section of it.</p>

</ul>

<p>When the work of the Congress was to be commenced,
the Reformers were in a great glee, as, happening to
command a majority in the Standing Congress Commit-
tee, they expected to carry things in their own way.
But Mr. Tilak soon made it clear to them that he would
be no party to such a manifestly unjust arrangement.
They, therefore had to set up a working Committee
consisting of an equal number of members belonging to
both the parties. How to neutralise this &quot; concession &quot;
was a question which seriously occupied some mischie-
vous spirits of the Reform Party and they hit upon a
very ingenious trick by means of which they hoped
either to place Mr. Tilak in an awkward situation or to
create a split in his party, which would give numerical
superiority to the Reformers in the Working Committee.
They stirred up the fury of the ultra-orthodox section
of the people by constantly boasting that the Social
Conference, so disliked by the majority — would be held
in the Congress pavilion in the teeth of their opposition.
The result was that Sardar Balasaheb Natu, with others
belonging to the extreme wing of the Orthodox Party
issued a circular, demanding that the Social Conference
should not be held in the Congress Mandap. Thus a
split was created in the Orthodox Camp.</p>
<p>Regarding the relations of the Social Conference witk
the National Congress, a contemporary paper wrote as</p>
<p>70 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>follows : — &quot; At the Calcutta Congress (1886) that shrewd
and experienced old Parsee, Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji, the
President dwelt upon the subject both in his opening
speech and during the discussion ; and decided against
the Congress having anything to do with Social Reform,
directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>&quot; But the hot-headed reformers, threw the words of
the old Parsi patriot, and the sense of the Calcutta
Congress to the winds. At Madras they tried their game
next year and with the assistance of a few addle-pated
Madrasee reformers succeeded in obtaining their wish ;
and after the Congress, was held within its pandals the
first Social Conference. * *</p>
<p>Since 1887 to 1894, the Social Conference has held its
sittings as the tail of the Congress.&quot;*</p>
<p>So much for wisdom ; now let us see how fanaticism
bred fanaticism. When the controversies over the Age
of Consent Bill were at their height, the late Mr. Hume^,
&quot; father &quot; of the Indian National Congress declared
that he would sever his connection from the Congress if
he found the majority of the leading Congressmen op-
posed to the BiU. This unreasonable and overbearing
conduct naturaUy excited many Congressmen and it
was said that if acquiescence in hasty and mischievous
measures of Social Reform was to be the price of the
support of Mr. Hume to India&rsquo;s political demands —
well, Indians could afford to do without him. Such
reckless language naturally made people suspicious and
as early as 189 1 many people expressed a desire
that the Social Conference should not be held in</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hope (Calcutta).</li>
</ul>
<p>TiLAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 7 1</p>
<p>the Congress pavilion. If responsible leaders like Hume
could give vent to such thoughtless remarks, can we
blame Sardar Balasaheb Natu for having given such an
undue importance to the site of the Social Conference ?
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s attitude regarding the dispute about the
Social Conference was perfectly reasonable. As early
as July 23rd, 1895, he openly declared in the Kesari that
those who made the holding or not holding of the Social
Conference in the Congress Mandap the condition of
their financial support to the Congress were not the
friends of the Congress. He proposed that the dispute
should be decided by the Congress itself or by the Re-
ception Committee. A better solution of this question
could not be imagined and yet the cry was kept up that
Mr. Tilak was supporting the extreme wing of the ortho-
dox party headed by Sardar Natu ! A side-Hght</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>on the sincerity of this cry is thrown by the fact
that som^e of the Reformers (e.g. Kashinathpant Natu,
Keshavrao Patvardhan) refused to contribute to the
Congress fund unless positively assured that the Social
Conference would be held in the Congress pavihon.</p>
<p>Another cry in the same game of anyhow discrediting
Mr. Tilak was that his attention to the Congress work
was perfunctory. People were &quot; shocked &quot; to find that
the pavilion was not ready in September. Mr. Tilak
reminded them it could be done only after the rainy
season was over. &quot; Wliat about chairs &quot; said they.
Mr. Tilak told them that though the chairs bore the
brand of &quot; AustraUan chairs &quot; stiU they could always be
had in Bombay at a week&rsquo;s notice. &quot; And the volun-
teers &ldquo;? Well, the volunteers were not required before
the middle of December ; still, written complaints were</p>
<p>72 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>made to the Working Committee. Mr. Tilak had
secured the site, prepared plans and estimates, sent
round men and letters for subscription, actually collect-
ed some money. For all this and other work, he
was praised by Mr. C. Vijayaraghavachariar who ex-
pressed his surprise that Poona should have com-
menced work in right earnest so early. And yet the
reformers of the Working Committee wanted to sit
in judgment upon Mr. Tilak. Mr. Tilak showed
how they themselves had shirked work and had
thrown all the burden upon him. He produced
the report of the Working Committee of the preceding
year&rsquo;s (1894) Congress at Madras and challenged his
opponents to compare that work with his. Discom-
fitted, the reformers had to submit to passing a
resolution expressing their satisfaction at Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>Discomfiture, however did not bring repentance.
Taking advantage of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s temporary absence
from Poona, they made attempts to remove the Congress
Office from his residence. The Sub-Committees were
swamped with reformers and instead of adhering to the
original resolution, fixing one vote for every gentleman
who paid Rs. 50 and upwards, it was decided (Oct. 18)
that those who paid upwards of Rs. 50 were entitled to
vote not only on their own behalf but separately for
heir wives and children ! A more ridiculous resolu-
tion cannot be imagined and this the reformers could
&ldquo;&lsquo;arry through only on account of the split in the Ortho-
*^ox party. And yet Mr. Tilak was supposed to have
^een in league with Sardar Natu !</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak exposed all these tactics in a circular letter</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 73</p>
<p>to all the leading Congressmen and Associations in the
mofussil. He also exposed them at a public meeting
held at Poona on October 22nd. As the Reformers&rsquo;
majority in the Committee had usurped all the func-
tions, it was resolved at this meeting that a new Recep-
tion Committee on an equitable basis should be formed.
The Reformers considered this meeting to be nothing
more than a display of &quot; brute force &quot; and hence
appealed to the Standing Committee to settle the dis-
pute. The Standing Committee decided that both the
parties should be represented by two Secretaries each,
that Bombay should contribute three Secretaries and
that this Committee of seven should carry on all the
Congress work. Great pressure was brought to bear
upon Mr. Tilak to accept this arrangement ; and when
at last Mr. Tilak did consent to it he quickly found that
it was all imaginary and that the status quo was main-
tained by the Reformers. Disgusted beyond measure
by all these tactics, Mr. Tilak took the only course left
to him and resigned his secretaryship on Nov. 4th.</p>
<p>The Reformers were delighted ; and 3^et they felt
unhappy. They felt as uncomfortable and suspicious
as Macbeth when he had got rid of Banquo. What if
Mr. Tilak made a row ? Police aid was sought and got
because &quot; the attitude of a section of the Hindu Com-
munity in Poona is hostile to the Congress.&rdquo; The re-
peated advice which Mr. Tilak gave to the public,
appealing to them to stand by the Congress, failed to
diminish this feverish anxiety. &ldquo;Suppose, the Mandap is
set on fire by Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s emissaries. WTiat would be-
come of the Congress?&rdquo; These foolish fears haunted
them like a nightmare. Still, with dogged and malig-</p>
<p>74 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>nant obstinacy they continued their activities against
Mr. Tilak, chiefly through a newspaper subsidized by
the Reception Committee. There is no knowing how
the unpleasantness of the situation would have been
aggravated had not the Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Surendranath
Banerjea, President-elect of the Congress, himself a
staunch Social Reformer, set matters right. He re-
quested Mr. Ranade not to press the question of the
Social Conference. He even threw out broad hints that
if the disputes at Poona could not be amicably settled
he would refuse to preside. This courageous and states-
manlike conduct compelled Mr. Ranade to be reasonable
and to make a belated declaration that he would not
try to hold the Social Conference in the Congress pavi-
lion. Had he made the declaration earlier and on his
own initiative, his reputation for statesmanship would
have been redeemed ; but his declaration made practi-
cally under compulsion, together with the continuance
by his minions of their disingenuous tactics kept the
situation almost unchanged. The offer of co-operation,
repeatedly made by Mr. Tilak was spumed. The Reform-
ers, conscious of their own unpopularity were afraid
to bear the light of the day. And yet a public meeting
to elect Poona delegates was to be held. Bowing to
the inevitable, they convened a public meeting (20th
December). The hall selected for the purpose was very
small and the announcement of the meeting was made
very late, presumably to outwit Mr. Tilak&rsquo; s partisans.
But long before the time of the meeting the opponents
of the Reformers, alert as ever had packed the hall.
With a clever manoeuvre they elected their own pre-
sident. This perplexed the Reformers and as a mark</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 75</p>
<p>of protest, some 15 gentlemen including Prof. Gokhale
left the meeting.</p>
<p>In spite of the worst fears of the reformers, the Con-
gress was a brilliant success. The reception accorded to
the Thunderer of Bengal was simply grand. Enthu-
siasm was catching. After the Congress was over
Sardar Baba Maharaj, a friend of Mr. Tilak was ' at
Home ' to the Congress President and the Congress
delegates. Then the party was led to attend a huge
meeting in connection with the Shivaji Memorial. Mr.
Banerjea made a thrilling speech and exhorted the^
|)eople to join the Shivaji festival inaugurated by
Mr. Tilak.</p>
<p>It is so very unpleasant to rake up from the forgot-
ten past an episode of discord. But when we find
attempts made to discredit Mr. Tilak for imaginary sins
it is necessary to apportion the blame and decide where
truth and fairness lay. Had Mr. Tialk&rsquo;s critics content-
ed themselves with asserting that he disapproved of the
holding of the Social Conference on the lines on which
it was held, nobody would have cared to criticise such
remarks for the simple reason that even leading Refor-
mers of those days lil^e the late Hon. Rao Bahadur
Nulkar thought pretty much in the same way. Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s supposed opposition to the Reform movement
or to the Social Conference had absolutely nothing to
do with the insignificant question of the holding of the
Social Conference in the Congress pavilion. If this
petty question assumed &quot; disproportionate dimensions,&rdquo;
the responsibility lies rather on those who, not caring
for the fair name of their city were wiUing to vent their
spite upon the devoted head of Mr. Tilak and discredit</p>
<p>^6 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>him in the eyes of his educated countrymen. The
attempt partially succeeded. For though outside the
Bombay Presidency, these disputes failed create any
impression still in Maharashtra the estrangement be-
tween the Reformers and the Orthodox party became
complete ; and what is more important, the Bombay
leaders who had taken very little part in the Social
questions of the day were considerably influenced by
the controversies owing to their association with the
Reformers at Poona. Here then was sown the seed of
that misunderstanding between the Lion of Bombay
and the Lion of Poona, which unfortunately was des-
tined to bear fruit at Surat in 1907. And all this could
have been avoided by a single tactful and timely move
on the part of Ranade.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we may note one or two incidents in
the life of the Congress which have a direct bearing on
the present narrative. We have already seen that in
the 2nd Congress at Calcutta, the Grand Old Man of
India, keenly aware of the danger of mixing up Social
Reform with Politics, declared the former as lying out-
side the scope of the Congress. Not that he did not
favour Social Reform, but he was particular about
the unity of Congressmen. The third Congress under
the Presidency of the late Mr. Badruddin Tyabji
did not pass a resolution in favour of Cow protection,
simply to conciliate Mahomedan opinion, in spite
of the fact that the President himself and aU
the delegates were in favour of protecting cows.
If then the third Congress could leave out one
important resolution — a question of principle — for
the sake of unity, could not Ranade have tried</p>
<p>TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I &lsquo;JJ</p>
<p>to secure unity by not pressing the Pandal quesr-
tion ? Evidently, therefore party feeling got the better
of patriotism. The smooth working of the Reception
Committee at the Calcutta Congress of 1806 was
endangered by bitter quarrels between the Bi ahmoes
and the Orthodox party and a breach over religious
questions seemed imminent. Here too, the principle
ot keeping the Congress aloof from Social and
religious controversies was forgotten. At the Madras
Congress of 1894, some Purists of the Social Re-
form party v/anted to boycott certain delegates whose
morals had become the subject of much public dis-
cussion and their extravagance was checked by the
judicious and tactful conduct of the President who
pointed out that though Gladstone was unwilling to nego-
tiate with Pamell as the leader of the Irish Nationalists,
still he had no objection to allow Pamell to work in the
interests of Irelanl. It will thus be seen that the
Poona disputes in 1895, did not form an isolated episode
in the history of the Congress. A political organisa-
tion that allows its cohesion to be endangered on side-
issues betrays its own interests and plays into the hands
of the common opponent. Viewed from this stand-
point, the ridiculous controversies over the pandal
question at Poona appear not merely impradent but
positively suicidil, irrespective of the responsibility of
this party or that ; and a careful perusal of t\2 prece-
ding pages will convince the reader that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s con-
tribution to these controversies was entirely involun-
tary.</p>

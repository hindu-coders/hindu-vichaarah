  <p>Up to the middle of the 19th century, myths and
traditions were the only materials available for the
study of pre-historic man. So various attempts were
made to systematise these myths and explain them ra-
tionally. But the mythologists carried on their re-
searches at a time when man was believed to be post-
glacial and when the physical and geographical sur-
roundings of the ancient man were assumed not to have
been materially different from those of the present day.
But about the middle of the igth century, from hund-
reds of stone and bronze implements found buried in
various places in Europe, the archaeologists established
the chronological sequence of the Iron, the Bronze and
the Stone age in times preceding the historic period and
discovered evidence to prove the existence of the Gla-
cial period at the close of the Quarternary era and the
high antiquity of man who was shown to have lived not
only throughout the Quarternary but also in the Ter-
tiary era when the climatic conditions of the globe were
quite different from those in the present or Post-Glacial
period. It, therefore, became evident that the results
previously arrived at by philologists and mythologists
must be revised in the hght of new scientific discoveries.
It also became necessary to study the ancient
sacred books of the Aryans in the light of modern</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 389</p>
<p>archaeological and geological discoveries ; for if
man existed before the last Glacial period and witness-
ed the gigantic change which brought on the Ice
age, it is not unnatural to expect that a reference, howso
ever concealed and distant, to these events would be found
in the oldest traditionary beliefs and memories of man-
kind. If we read some of the passages in the Vedas,
which have hitherto been considered incomprehensible,
in the light of the new scientific discoveries, we arc
forced to the conclusion that the home of the ancestors
of the Vedic people was somewhere near the North
Pole before the last Glacial epoch.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to discuss the Vedic texts which
point to a Polar Home, it is necessary to briefly state
the results of recent discoveries in archaeology, geology
and palaeontology. Human races of earlier times have
left ample evidence of their existence on the surface of
this globe. It consists of hundreds and thousands of
rude or polished instruments of stone and metal, recent-
ly dug out from old camps, fortifications, burial-grounds,
temples etc. Archaeologists have come to the conclu-
sion that these implements can be classified into those
of stone, those of bronze and those of iron, representing
three different stages of civilisation in the progress of
man in pre-historic times. Of these three different ages,
the oldest or the Stone age is further divided into the
Palaeolithic and the Neolithic period or the old and the
new Stone age.</p>
<p>The Geologist takes up the history of the earth at the
point where the archaeologist leaves it and carries it
further back into antiquity. From an examination cf
the stratified rocks, according to the character of the</p>
<p>39® LOKAMANYA TIL4K</p>
<p>fossils found in them, the geologist has divided the
history of our planet into five different periods.</p>
<p>The Iron age, the Bronze age and the Neolothic age
come under the Recent or the Post-Glacial period while
the Palaeolithic age is supposed to fall in the Pleisto-
cene period. Various estimates have been made re-
garding the time of the commencement of the Neolithic
age but the oldest date assigned does not exceed 5000
B.C. Regarding the commencement of the Palaeolo-
thic period, there are two different views entertained
by the geologists, Prof. Geikie putting it between 50 to
60 thousand years ago and the American geologists at
about 8000 years only.</p>
<p>As regards the races which inhabited Europe in these
early ages, the evidence furnished by human remains or
skulls shows that they were the direct ancestors of the
races now living in the different parts of Europe. The
question, whether the Aryans were autochthonous or
went to Europe from some other place cannot be settled
by these discoveries. But the Vedic and Avestic evidence
proves that the Aryans were autochthonous neither in
Europe nor in Central Asia but had their original home
somewhere near the North Pole in the Palaeolithic
times and that they migrated from this place south-
wards in Asia and Europe, not by any &quot; irresisti-
ble impulse &quot; but by unwelcome changes in the climatic
conditions of their original home. From the geological
evidence of fossil, fauna and flora, we find that in the
early geological ages when the Alps were low and the
Himalayas not yet upheaved and when Asia and Africa
were represented by only a group of islands, an
equable and uniform climate prevailed over the</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 391</p>
<p>whole surface of the globe. A luxuriant forest
vegetation, which can only grow and exist at present
in the tropical or temperate clirpate, flourished in
the high altitude of Spitzbergen, where the sun goes
below the horizon from November till March, thus
showing that a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic
regions in those days. If, therefore, the Vedic evidence
points to an Arctic Home where the ancestors of the
Vedic Rishis lived in ancient times, there is nothing
in the latest scientific discoveries which would
warrant us in considering this result as a priori impro-
bable.</p>
<p>It has been a fashion to speak of the Polar regions as
characterised by light and darkness of six months each ;
but this statement is only roughly true. The Pole is
merely a point and all the inhabitants of the original
ancient Home, if there was one near the North Pole,
could not have lived precisely at this single point. We
must, therefore, distinguish between the characterestics
of the Polar region and those of the circum-polar region.</p>
<p>THE POLAR CHARACTERESTICS.</p>
<p>(i) The Sun rises in the South.</p>
<p>(2) The stars do not rise and set ; but revolve or spin
round and round, in horizontal planes, completing one
round in 24 hours.</p>
<p>(3) The year consists only of one long day and one
long night of six months each,</p>
<p>(4) There is only one morning and one evening. But
the twilight, whether of the morning or of the evening,
lasts continuously for about two months. The ruddy
light of the morn or the evening twilight moves round
and round along the horizon, like a potter&rsquo;s wheel.</p>
<p>392 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>THE CIRCUM-POLAR CHARACTERESTICS.</p>
<p>(i) The Sun will always be to the South of the Zenith
of the observer.</p>
<p>(2) A large number of stars are circum-polar ; the
rest rise and set, but revolve in more oblique circles.</p>
<p>(3) The year is made up of three parts : — (a) one long
continuous night lasting for a period of greater than 24
hours and less than six months according to the lati-
tude of the place (h) one long continuous day to match
ic) a succession of ordinary days and nights during the
rest of the year, never exceeding a period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>(4) The dawn, at the close of the long continuous
night, lasts for several days but its duration and magni-
iicance is proportionally less than at the North Pole.
The other dawns will only last for a few hours.</p>
<p>We can take these differentae as our unerring guides
in the examination of the Vedic evidence bearing on the
point at issue . If a Vedic description or tradition dis-
closes any of the characterestics mentioned above, we
may safely infer that the tradition is Polar or circum-
Polar in origin, and the phenomenon, if not actually
witnessed by the poet, was at least known to him by
tradition, faithfully handed down from generation to
generation. Such references in the Vedic literature
may be divided into two parts : the first comprising
those passages which directly refer to the long night or
the long dawn and the second consisting of myths or
legends which corroborate and indirectly support the
first.</p>
<p>We find passages in the Rig-veda (X, 89, 4. II, 15.2.
IV, 56, 3 X, 89, 2) which compare the motion of the
heavens to that of a wheel and state that the celestial</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 393</p>
<p>Vault is supported as if on an axis. Combining these
two statements, we may safely infer that the motion
referred to is such a motion of the celestial hemisphere
as can be witnessed only by an observer at the North
Pole.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to another characterestic of the
Polar regions viz a day and a night of six months each
and examine references to this characterestic, reference
to which is found not only in the Puranas but also in
astronomical works. Surya-Siddhanta (XII, 67) says
&quot; At Meru, Gods behold the sun after but a single
rising during the half of his revolution beginning with
Aries.&rdquo; Manu describing the divisions of time says
(I, 67) &quot; A year (human) is a day and a night of the
gods.&rdquo; In Chapters 163 and 164 of the Vanaparvam
(Mahabharat), Arjuna&rsquo;s \dsit to mount Meru is described
in detail and we are therein told &quot; At Meru the sun and
the moon go round from left to right every day and so
&lt;io all the stars &quot; Later on, the writer says &quot; The moun-
tain by its lustre, so overcomes the darkness of night,
that the night can hardly be distinguished from the
day.&rdquo; A few verses further, and we find, &quot; The day
and the night are together equal to a year to the resi-
dents of the place.&rdquo; Evidently, the writer had a tole-
rably correct idea of the meteorological and astronomi-
-cal characterestics of the North Pole. The lustre of the
mountain is the splendour of the Aurora Borealis visible
at the North Pole. Passing from the Post Vedic literature
to the Vedic we find in the Taittiraya Brahmana (III, 9
22, i) &quot; That which is a year is but a single day of the
Gods.&rdquo; It is true that the statement, or anything similar
to it is not found in the Samhita portion of the Rigveda^</p>
<p>But there are many other passages which go to corro-
borate this statement in a remarkable way.</p>
<p>The long continuous dawn with its revolving splen-
dours is another characterestic of the North Pole. The
Vedic poets could not have gone into raptures over the
short-lived dawn of the tropical or temperate zone. In the
Aitareya Brahmana IV, 7, a long recitation of not less
than a thousand verses is to be recited by the Hotri priest
&ldquo;when the darkness of the night is about to be relieved
by the light of the dawn.&rdquo; So there must have been
in those days, sufficient time between the first appear-
ance of light and the rise of the sun, to recite the long
song. Sometimes the recitation ended long before sun-
rise and in that case other hymns are required to be
continued, and Apa Stamb requires all the ten
mandalas of the Rigvedas to be recited if necessary.
In Rigveda VII. 76 the poet expressly tells us
that a period of several days elapsed between the first
appearance of the dawn and the actual rising of the
sun, and the commentator, Sayana, not under-
standing how the words &quot; day &quot; can be applied to a
period of time anterior to sunrise, twists the meaning
of the &quot; Ahan &quot; and translates it by &quot; splendour.&rdquo;
Similarly in Rig. II. 28-9 the words bhuyasih ushasah
avyushtah which literally mean &quot; many dawns have
not dawned or fully flashed forth &quot; have been a riddle
to the commentators. These dawns were thirty in
number (Taittiriya Samhita IV. 3. 11). Sayana,
unable to account for so many dawns explains that
though the dawn was one yet by its Yogic powers, it
assumed these various shapes !</p>
<p>When the long duration of the Vedic dawn is once</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 395</p>
<p>demonstrated, it astronomically follows that long days
and long nights existed in those times. Let us, how-
ever, try to find independent evidence of their existence.
There are many passages in the Rig- Veda that speak of
long and ghastly darkness in one form or other. Thus
in I, 32, 10 Vritra, the traditional enemy of Indra, is
said to be engulfed in long darkness. In V, 32, 5, Indra
is described as having placed Shushna, who was anxious
to fight in &quot; the darkness of the pit.&rdquo; The next verse
speaks of Sunless (ghastly) darkness. These expres-
sions lose all their propriety, if the darkness, in which
the enemies of Indra are said to have flourished, be
taken to be ordinary darkness of twelve, or at best, of
twenty-four hours&rsquo; duration. It was in reality a long
one.</p>
<p>In the loth Mandala of the Rig- Veda we have a hymn
(127) in which Night is invoked to &quot; become easily
fordable.&rdquo; In the Parishishta, which follows this
hymn the worshipper addresses the Night &quot; May we
reach the other side in safety ! May we reach the other
side in safety.&rdquo; In the Atharva-Veda, XIX, 47, the
second verse runs thus &quot; Each moving thing finds rest
in her (Night) whose yonder boundary, is not seen, nor
that which keeps her separate &quot; In the Taittiriya Sam-
hita I, 5, 5, 4, we have a similar prayer addressed to
the Night and a little later I, 5, 7, 5, the Samhita itself
explains the prayer thus &quot; In old times the Brahmans
were afraid that it (night) would not dawn.&rdquo; What
does this signify ? If the night was not unusually long,
where was the necessity for entertaining any misgivings
about the coming dawn ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ill, 55, II literally translated means : — &quot; The twin</p>
<p>pair (females) make many forms ; of the two one shines
and the other is dark. Two sisters are they, the dark and
the bright.&rdquo; We have here a two-fold description of
the couple (Day and Night). It is called the shining
and the dark and also is described as possessed of many
forms. Say ana interprets these forms as different
colours like black, white etc. This is evidently
wrong. Are we to suppose that we may have
sometimes green, violet, yellow or blue days and
nights ? Again though mpa may lend itself to
this interpretation, the word used in the above
verse, Vapumshi cannot be so understood. It
can only denote the extent, duration and length of days
and nights, in addition to their colour, which can be
only twofold, dark or bright. The first half of the
verse, therefore, means, &quot; The twin pair assume various
(nana) lengths (Vapumshi) ; of the two one shines and the
other is dark. The third quarter of the verse &quot; Two
sisters are they, the dark (Shyavi) and the bright
(arushi)&rdquo; has puzzled the commentators but they have
solved the riddle by regarding the twins (yamya) and
the sisters (svasaran) as identical. But this is wrong.
The only possible explanation is that the year spoken
of in the passage is a circum-PoIar year made up of one
long day and one long night, forming one pair and a
number of ordinary days and nights of various lengths
which can be described as &quot; bright, dark and of varying
lengths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In X, 138, 3, the third verse begins with &quot; The Sun
unyoked his car in the midst of heaven,&rdquo; not at sunset
or on the horizon but in the midst of heaven. The
words are quite clear. Mr. Griffith tries to explain this</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 397</p>
<p>difficulty by thinking that the poet here refers to an
eclipse. But during an eclipse, the sun is covered with ♦
the dark shadow of the earth and is not besides sta-
tionary. Sayana twists the meaning. But we need
not be impatient to escape from the natural meaning
of the verse. A long halt of the sun in the midst of
the heaven is clearly described here and it refers to the
long day of the Arctic region.</p>
<p>In the Samhita and the Brahmanas, the annual
sattras, or yearly sacrificial sessions, are said to extend
over twelve months. But this was impossible within
the Arctic region, where the sun goes below the horizon
for a number of months during the year, thereby pro-
ducing the long night. The oldest duration of the
annual sattras, if such were ever performed within the
Polar regions, would therefore be shorter than twelve
months. In other words, an annual sattra of less than
twelve months would be the chief distinguishing mark
of the older sacrificial system. As all the people can-
not be expected to be stationed at the Pole, the months
of sunshine will vary from seven to eleven for the inha-
bitants of the Arctic region ; and the Arctic sacrificial
year, would be made up of these months of sunshine.
Let us now interpret the legend of Aditi or the seven
Adityas (Suns). This legend expressly tells us that the
oldest number of Adityas is seven. The sun is called
seven horsed and in V, 45, 9 and his seven wheeled
chariot is said to be drawn by seven bay steeds (I, 50, 8).
The Atharva-Veda speaks of the &quot; seven bright rays of
the Sun (VII, 107, i). Sayana is unable to account for
the number seven as applied to the rays. The cue to
understand the legend can be had from Shatapatha</p>
<p>398 LOKAMANYA TII^K</p>
<p>Brahmana which says &quot; There are twelve months of
the year ; these are the Adityas.'* It therefore the
twelve Adityas represent the twelve months of the year,
the seven Adityas must have once (purvyam yugam)
represented the seven months of the year. The legend
of the Dashagvas or Dirghatamas points to the existence
of an year of ten months ; and as these cannot be ac-
counted for except on the Arctic theory, the chain of
evidence is strengthened by these legends.</p>
<p>The sacrificial literature also helps us in arriving at
the same hypothesis. Once in the Aitaraya Brahmana
and twice in the Taittiriya Samhita, we meet with des-
criptions regarding the Gavam-Ayanam, or the &quot; cows&rsquo;
walk &quot; wherein cows are represented as holding a sacri-
ficial session. This session could be completed in 10 or
12 months. Why the session could be completed in 10
months seems to have puzzled Sayana and others, who
merely content themselves with remarking that it is
an &quot; immemorial customs.&rdquo; The Arctic theory throws
quite a new light on this tradition. Tlie Gavam-ayanam
of ten months and the old Roman year of ten months
are relics of the period when the Aryans lived within
the circumpolar regions. The * cows ' were not really
cows, but the Adityas (month-gods).</p>
<p>If we turn to Vedic mythology, we find several stories,
which cannot be properly explained either on the Dawn
or Storm theory. The description of Indra&rsquo;s fight with
Vritra records four simultaneous effects (i) the release
of the cows (2) the release of the waters (3) the produc-
tion of the dawn and (4) the production of the
Sun. Advocates of the Storm theory describe
Vrita as a storm-cloud and by smiting it with his</p>
<p>APPENDIX B 399</p>
<p>thunder- bolt, Indra may be described as releasing the
waters imprisoned therein. But where are the cows
which are said to be released along with the waters.
The Niruktas interpret cows to mean Waters ; but in
that case the release of the waters and the release of
the cows are not two distinct effects.</p>
<p>The struggle between Indra and Vritra is really a
struggle between the powers of light and darkness. The
passages where waters are said to be released by Indra
after kilhng Vritra do not refer expressly to the rain-
cloud. Vedic scholars have wrongly supposed that when
the Rig- Veda speaks of the celestial waters (divyah apah)
only the rain-waters are intended. But this is a mis-
take ; for in passages which speak of the creation of the
world (X, 82, 6 ; 129, 3) the world is said to have once
consisted of nothing but undifferentiated waters, — or
in the language of modem scientists of ' ether ' or</p>
<ul>
<li>nebulous mass of matter.&rsquo; The ancient Aryans like
the old Hebrews believed that the subtle matter which
filled the whole space in the universe was nothing but
watery Vapours ; and secondly that the movements of
the Sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies were
caused by these Vapours which kept on constantly cir-
culating from the neither to the upper and from the
Upper to the lower celestial hemisphere. The mischief
wrought by Vritra was that he stopped the flow of these
waters ; consequently the Sun, the moon, the stars all
ceased to rise. Indra by killing Vritra released the
waters and brought with them the dawn, the Sun, and
the cows (i.e., days or the rays of the morning). The
victory is thus naturally described as four-fold . Ob-
jectors to this theory might say that the struggle</li>
</ul>
<p>400 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>between Indra and Vritra is a daily fight between light
and darkness. But X, 62, 2 shows that the struggle
was annual. This proves the Arctic Home hypo-
thesis.</p>
<p>The Avesta contains two passages (first two Far-^
gards) which also point to this theory. The first
Fargard (chapter) of the Vendidad enumerates 16 lands
created by Ahura Mazda. As soon as each land was^
created Angra Mainyu, the evil spirit created different
evils and plagues to invade the land and make it unfit
for human habitation. Out of these 16 lands 10 can
be still identified with certainty. This proves that
the account is real and not mythological. The Airyana
Vaejo is described as the first good and happy creation
of Ahura Mazda but Angra Mainyu converted it into
a land of ten months winter and two months summer.
This sudden change in the climate of the Airyana Valjo,
converting ten months summer and two months winter
into ten months severe winter and two months cold
summer was clearly due to the advent of the Glacial
period as established by modern geologists. The
second Fargard of the Vendidad&rsquo; gives us a graphic des-
cription of the actual advent of ice and snow. It also
informs us that a Vara or enclosure was made to pro-
vide against the calamity and that in this Vara, the sun,
the moon and the stars rose but once a year.</p>
<p>The cumulative weight of these and other researches
incontrovertibly establishes Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s theoiy.</p>

<p>An Additional Membership is, as I view it, no sop or gag intended to stop honest and fair criticism. But if it is, I should
certainly give it up rather than consent to draw the curtain over
the gross negligence or the palpable errors of officials, however
high they may be.</p>
<p>B. G. Tilak</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 7th, 1895, Mr. Tilak, elected by an overwhelming majority by the District Local Boards
of the Central Division, took, in the Legislative
Council, the customary oath of allegiance to Her Ma-
jesty, the Queen-Empress. Two years later he was
standing as an under-trial prisoner in the High Court
of Judicature, to be punished of disaffection, in spite
of his protests and in anticipation of a new interpre-
tation of the term ! The first event did not ensnare
him, nor was his Hfe-work paralysed by the second.</p>
<p>During the course of these two years, the Council
met for 8 ' long ' days and worked for less than 36
hours. As usual pertinent interpellations were asked
to which pertinent or impertinent answers were re-
turned. The discussion on the financial statement
occupied much time. And the residue was devoted
to the following questions : —</p>
<p>I. The Bombay Civil Courts Act, 1869 Amendment
Bill.</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND 1 79</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The Rules for conducting the business of the
Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Bill to amend the Karachi Port Trust Act, 1886</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(withdrawn).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>A Bill to amend the Bombay Boiler Inspection
Act, 1891.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Bill to amend the Bombay General Clauses Act,</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>A Bill to amend Act VIII of 1870 (an act for the
prevention of the murder of female infants).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Bill to further amend the City of Bombay</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Municipal Act, 1888.
A barren epoch, to be sure ! Under the regime of
the Morley-Minto Reforms, members could at least
spread, peacock-like, the glorious plumage of their
knowledge and oratory. They could at least show off
their grasp of economic problems and administrative
details and could count upon moral effect of their
work, — moral effect, not certainly upon the Bureau-
cracy but upon their countrymen. But in the Coun-
cils established under the Act of 1892, neither actual
nor moral effect was possible. Amendments, here and
there, of the Government Bills and a desultory discus-
sion on the Budget, after &quot; it had ceased to be a Bud-
get &quot; and &quot; had been sanctioned by the Government
of India &quot; — that was all that could be done. Even
the Bureaucracy confessed that the &quot; examination of
the contents of the Budget was little better than a
post-mortem dissection &ldquo;; and though Mr. Tilak re-
torted by pointing out that &quot; we could as well dissect
a living as a dead Budget,&rdquo; stiU he had to submit to
the inevitable. Under the flow of smooth and cour-</p>
<p>80 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>teous words, the representatives of the Bureaucracy
hardly failed to be sarcastic and overbearing. Mem-
bers like the Hon. Mr. Sayani, who read carefully pre-
pared manuscript speeches were &quot; respectfully &quot; re-
quested to save their &quot; physical labour &quot; of reading
them, by submitting to the Council printed copies^
which &quot; might then be taken as read.&rdquo; The Hon.
Messrs. Javerilal and Setalwad were blamed for turn-
ing the Council into a &quot; Circus,&rdquo; in which annually they
were &quot; wont to trot out their hobby horses.&rdquo; With
such limitation and environments, it was natural that
the output of the work of the representatives of the
people was dis-appointingly small. Equally with his
University fellowship* or the Municipal Councillorship,
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s membership of the Legislative Council failed
to add one inch to his worth or one grain to his use-
fulness. It was simply a trifling accident of his life.</p>
<p>In several respects, Mr. Tilak possessed many of the
qualities that go to make a great legislator. He had
in him that unique combination of the idealist and the
realist which is the sine qua non of a successful law-
giver. His grasp of general principles, his mastery
over petty and intricate details, his patience in investi-
gation, his breadth of vision, his legal acumen, ready
wit and resourceful intellect — all these qualities would
have taken his name down to posterity as the maker of</p>
<ul>
<li>In January 1894, Mr. Tilak was elected a fellow of th®
Bombay University. In May 1895, he headed the poll at the
genarai elections to the Poona City Municipality. He resigned
his msmjers&rsquo;lip of the City Municipality in 1897. After his
convictijn {iS)j) he was deprived of his University fellov, ship
by the Government of Bombay salutary laws. But like Sir Pherozeshah, he too was
destined to play the role of a mere critic of the ad-
ministration.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND ! 8l</p>
<p>In spite of the limitations imposed upon his usefulness,
Mr. Tilak worked in the Council with his usual ardour.
Conscious though he was that all his criticism would
very little affect the actual working of the admi-
nistration, he wanted to put the whole Bureaucratic
machine under his intellectual microscope. He was
not content, therefore, with copies of the Financial
Statement and of the Budget but called for the Advo-
cate-General&rsquo;s Budget Notes. But the officials did not
consider it worth their while to grant his request. Ap-
parently they thought that the Budget which formed
*&rsquo; a printed document of close upon 200 pages &quot; and the
financial statement which fitted &quot; a pamphlet of
fair dimensions and touched on every head, whe-
ther of revenue or expenditure,&rdquo; ought to satisfy
Mr. Tilak.</p>
<p>The originality of his genius showed itself in the
Council. Not satisfied like other speakers with merely
comparing the year&rsquo;s (1895-96) Budget with the Revised
Estimates of 1894-95 and the Actuals of 1893-94, he
proceeded to consider it in a true scientific spirit by
examining &quot; how far the revenue has increased during
the last 25 years and what portion of it has been devoted
to the material development of the Province.&rdquo; This
led to the conclusion that &quot; the revenue of the Presi-
dency has increased by about 5| crores of rupees during
the last 25 years. Land, Forest, Abkari have all been
made yield as much as possible even to the inconve-
nience of the people i and yet out of the revenues so
6</p>
<p>82 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>realised only a small portion has been devoted to the
material improvements of the Province.*&rsquo; ^</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak was not afraid to beard the Hon in his own
den. Referring to the cess on Ahkari revenue, recently
commuted, he asked whether &quot; Government by an Exe-
cutive act can repeal an Act of the Legislature.&rdquo; It
was impossible for the Government members to dis-
lodge him from his positions, nor did they dare hurl at
him their arrows of ridicule or banter. Unlike many
members of the Council, he was extremely sparing of
compliments to the Official Members. He never gave
praise, he never sought it. His speeches were severely
impersonal and unrhetorical, studded with facts, mas-
terly handled. What struck his hearers was the breadth
and originality of his view-point and the facility with
which he strode through the intricacies of statistics.
The success of his speeches lay in the luminous way in
which he used figures without quoting them frequently.
This was the case with his writings also.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s short connection with the Legislative
Council came to an end in 1897, when he resigned his
seat, (after the criminal prosecution for sedition had been
launched against him.) Among his colleagues in the
Council, were the Hon. (Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad, the
late Sir P. M. Mehta and the late Mr. Daji Abaji Khare.</p>
<p>The year 1896-97 deserves to be recorded in shining
letters of gold in the life of Mr. Tilak, because it brings
out in bold relief that quality of his heart, which, though
it forms the basis of his character, is generally over-
looked by superficial observers, dazzled by his militant
personaUty — we mean his genuine philanthrophy.
Great as was the intellect of Mr. Tilak, his heart was</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND I 83</p>
<p>greater still. The terrible famine and distress of 1877
moved him as nothing else did and was, as we have seen
mainly responsible for fixing the course of his life. The
outbreak of famine and the irruption of the plague in
this year (1896-97) shocked him and he knew no rest
while labouring for the suffering thousands. Those
who saw him at work during this eventful period
recognised how his very soul was on fire.</p>
<p>In ordinary times and under normal circumstances
popular aid and co-operation on occassions of famine or
epidemics are welcome to Government. But in the
peculiar circumstances of India, such co-operation is
sometimes discouraged by the Bureaucrats who con-
sider the masses as their own property and would keep
them from the * evil ' influence of the educated classes.
When terrible famine broke out in 1896, Mr. Tilak
was the centre of all popular activities directed towards
the mitigation of every kind of suffering. Lord
Elgin, the then Viceroy was busy with his round of
visits to Indian States, the lesser European Officials
were indifferent and apathetic and the Indian Officers
like the Mamlatdars were, as usual, more desirous of
collecting the revenue anyhow and of being patted on
the back by their superiors, than of doing their duty by
the poor ryots. The Missionaries had their own axe to
grind. The public opinion in England was in the be-
ginning ignorant of the terrible state of things. Later
on, it was roused enough and some help to the famine-
stricken was offered. But the Indian Government was
at first rather unwilling to accept it.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s programme included 4 items, (i) He sent
round the presidency his lieutenants to collect informa-</p>
<p>84 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>tion regarding famine conditions. His obect was to
check the inacuracies of the reports submitted by Mam-
latdars to their superiors. (2) These heutenants dis-
cussed measures of rehef with local leaders, with a view
to formulate constructive suggestions to Government.
The Government had no doubt the guidance of the
Famine Relief Code ; but evidently Mr. Tilak had greater
faith in local bodies and leaders. The next two items
concerned the people more directly. (3) It usually
happened that most of the villagers, ignorant of the
concessions promised by the Relief Code, sold away
their lands or cattle to pay off the Government dues ;
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s * emissaries &lsquo;, therefore, acquainted the
people with their rights, explained the relevant sections
of the Relief Code and distributed leaflets or pamphlets
containing abstracts of the important sections of the
Relief Code. (4) Having thus educated the people in
the knowledge of their rights, they asked them not to
be cowards and not to pay the Government dues at the
cost of their lives or property. It will be seen that the
agitation imparted the necessary knowledge to the peo-
ple and exhorted them to show manliness ; and by con-
structive suggestions it compelled the Government to
insist on accuracy of reports and strict enforcement of
rules. Week after week, the Kesari devoted all its
columns to the discussion of the situation ; &quot; Will you &quot;
Mr. Tilak passionately asked, &ldquo;when the Queen desires
that none should die, when the Governor declares that all
should 1 ve and the Secretary of State is prepared to go
in for debt, if necessary — will you kill yourself by timi-
dity and starvation ? If you have money to pay Govern-
ment dues, pay them by all means. But if you have</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND ! 85</p>
<p>not, will you sell your things away only to avoid the
supposed wrath of subordinate Government officers ?
Can you not be bold, even when in the grip of death ?*&rsquo;
This terrible unmanliness shocked him most. &quot; We
can stand any number of famines,&rdquo; he said &quot; but what
shall we do, with sheepish people ?&rdquo; &quot; Had such a
famine broken out in England and had the Prime
Minister been as apathetic as is Lord Elgin, his Govern-
ment would have, in less than a week, tumbled down
like ninepins.&rdquo; He deplored and condemned food-
riots. &quot; Why loot the Bazars &ldquo;, he used to say &quot; go
to the Collector and tell him to give you work and food.
That is his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really speaking the Government ought He have
hailed the vigorous co-operation of Mr. Tilak. He was
making useful and constructive suggestions to them,
through the memorials of the Sarvajanik Sabha and the
columns of the Kesari and the Mahratta. But it was
evident that the heaven-born Bureaucrats disliked the
splendid growth of organisation under Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s in-
spiring guidance, because the * new spirit ' meant in-
convenience to them. They found the plastic clay
hardening into rock. The people were firm, not mili-
tant ; law abiding, not aggressive, still the authorities
deemed it necessary to put down the New Spirit.</p>
<p>The first attempt in this direction was made at a
village Khattalwad (Dec. 13, 1896) where Prof. Sathe, of
the Maharashtra College, Poona, specially sent by Mr.
Tilak for propaganda work, had the unique honour and
opportunity of delivering a lecture in the presence of
the Assistant Collector and a posse of soldiers. This
evidently was an attempt to reduce the morale of the</p>
<p>86 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>people and to cow down the lecturer. But the attempt
failed and Prof. Sathe made a spirited lecture in spite of
the intimidation conveyed by the presence of an armed
force. Prof. Sathe was tried at Alibag for abetting
several Forest and Abkari offences. The prosecution
failed. It was soon followed by another. This time
the victims were three gentlemen of Thana, who had
done public service by issuing a leaflet in which provi-
sions of the Famine Code were explained. This pro-
secution too was a fiasco. In the next prosecution, a
Mr. Apte was convicted and sentenced to simple impri-
sonment for one year ; and soon after, the Sarvajanik
Sabha which had led the agitation for the mitigation of
the suffering caused by the famine was, on some flimsy
pretext, declared to have forfeited its right to petition,
tke Government.</p>
<p>Of all the agitations led by Mr. Tilak, this one was
the most systematic and organised. It was an agita-
tion which all men understood, which allowed very
little room for party squabbles, and which the Govern-
ment was afraid to put down. Combining the strength
of simplicity and unity and suffering from little opposition^
it became irresistible. It opened a new vista before
Mr. Tilak. He saw immense possibilities in such well-
organised agitations ; and he wanted the Congress to
undertake an agitation, that would reach even the most
distant hamlet. Upto this time, Mr. Tilak was satis-
fied with — or rather he acquiesced in — the methods of
Congrss leaders. But now he wanted a radical change.
Referring to the proceedings of the 12th Congress
held at Calcutta he said : {Kesari, January 12th, 1896)</p>
<p>&quot; For the last twelve years we have been shouting</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND ! 87</p>
<p>hoarse, desiring that the Government should hear us.
But our shouting has no more affected the Government
than the sound of a gnat. Our rulers disbeheve our
statements or profess to do so. Let us now try to
force our grievances into their ears by strong constitu-
tional means. We must give the best political educa-
tion possible to the ignorant villagers. We must meet
them on terms of equality, teach them their rights and
show how to fight constitutionally. Then only will the
Government realise that to despise the Congress is to
despise the Indian Nation. Then only will the efforts
of the Congress leaders be crowned with success. Such
a work will require a large body of able and single-
minded workers, to whom Politics would not mean
some holiday recreation but an every-day duty to be
performed with strictest regularity and utmost capa-
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closely in the heels of the Famine followed the Plague
which has till now exacted the heavy toll of one crore
of Indian lives. The feU nature of the disease
and its sudden irruption created a consternation which
was aggravated by the helplessness of the medical
science in arresting its spread. The medical advisers
of the Government failed, at first, to take any serious
notice of the disease and when at last its looming sha-
dow terrified the European nations and it became
evident that not only had the plague become really
virulent but also threatened to scare away European
trade, strictest sanitary measures were devised to stem
its tide. But trouble arose in the execution of these
measures. Actuated, no doubt, by an earnest desire</p>
<p>o stamp out this unwelcome guest in minimum time.</p>
<p>88 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>the Government officers rigorously enforced measures
for the safety of the people. They however failed to
temper their rigour by enlisting popular sympathy.
They neither sought public support and co-operation
nor did they welcome it when spontaneously offered.
Such benevolent execution of precautionary measures
required a higher type of imagination than the Bureau-
crants could command and while men like Lord San-
dhurst sincerely wished the least interference with the
conveniences of the people, the plague measures actually
created greater terror than the epidemic itself.</p>
<p>To save themselves from the epidemic, many so-
called leaders of the people left Poona to a safer retreat.
But Mr. Tilak did not do so. He stood by the suffering
multitude, shared their misfortunes, helped them,
started a Plague Hospital and did his best to interpret
the difficulties of the people to the Government and the
wishes of the Government to the people. The conduct
of Mr. Tilak in thus co-operating with the Government
was strongly criticised by many of the followers of
Ranade and insinuations were recklessly made that the
Lion of Poona was ensnared by the additional member-
ship of the Legislative Council. The time soon came
when the pseudo-lions of Poona humiliated themselves
before the British Lion, while Mr. Tilak refused to be
cowed down by the terrors of repression.</p>
<p>For an effective crusade against the Plague, the re-
lief work was taken — without any semblance of law
or justice — out of the hands of the Municipality and was
continued by a special body, called the Plague Commit-
tee, a purely European association headed by the &lsquo;* sul-
len and suspicious &quot; Mr. Rand. With the name of this</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND ! 89</p>
<p>self-willed, unsympathetic and unlucky administrator
is associated the segration-work, with its inevitable
corollary of the house-to-house search-parties. Afraid
and terror-stricken, the people were, it was thought,
unwilling to communicate to the proper authorities
plague-attacks of inmates in their houses or to allow
their ailing relatives to be taken for treatment to the
hospitals. But the administrators of the plague-
policy never put themselves the question &quot; Why.&rdquo; Mr.
Tilak showed how &quot; as soon as a patient is removed to
the hospital, his relations are taken to the segregation
camp, some of the infected property is destroyed and
his house is kept &quot; practically &quot; open without anybody
to take care of the property.&rdquo; He also pointed out
that people were more ready to send patients to the
hospital started by him and to pay for them than allow
them to be taken to the Government Hospital, which
was a charitable institution. The question resolved
itself into &quot; how to make the work popular &quot; and with
this end in view he made a number of constructive sugges-
tions. But it was not in the nature of the officers ap-
pointed, to appreciate the popular view-point and ac-
cept suggestions, most of which they could have adopt-
ed without sacrificing the essentials of their policy.
Even then trouble could have been avoided, had the
British soldiers not been appointed to conduct the
searches. Mr. Tilak held that &quot; howsoever a British
soldier may be useful on the battlefield, he is not suited
for a work of this kind &quot; and suggested that the work
** can be equally, if not more efficiently, carried on by
native agency working under Civil Officers than by
British soldiers whose ignorance of native manners</p>
<p>go LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>very often leads them to unnecessarily offend the
susceptibilities of the people.&rdquo; But this advice was
unheeded.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell here upon what wab rightly
or wrongly described as the &ldquo;reign of terror &quot; at Poona
and its echoes in England, so sadly associated with the
name of Prof. (aften^ards Hon. Mr.) Gokhale whose
statements regarding the outrages made by British sol-
diers exasperated the Government and who immediate-
ly on his return to India was induced to tender an &ldquo;ab-
ject &lsquo;* apology and withdraw not only those charges
which for want of evidence he could not substantiate,
but all his criticism regarding the plague measures.
For a time the Plague subsided but the discontent its
administration had aroused, emboldened one fanatic
to seek redress in the murder of Mr. Rand. The
name of this fanatic was Damodar Chapekar, who
after a number of unsuccessful attempts to track
Mr. Rand at last got hold of him, on the night of
June 22, 1897, when Mr. Rand was returning from
the Government House where he had gone to
attend the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee
of Her Majesty the Queen Victoria&rsquo;s accession to
the throne. In the darkness of night, Chapekar
shot Mr. Rand dead. His accomplice heard an
exclamation from the carriage which Lieutenant
Ayerst was riding and &quot; thinking possibly that they
were discovered &quot; killed Lieutenant Ayerst also ! These
shocking murders created an atmosphere of panic and
consternation which was cleverly exploited by Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s enemies to induce the Government to embark
on a campaign of repression.</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE AND ! Qt</p>
<p>The &ldquo;panacea &quot; to plague was soon discovered in the
&lsquo;* innoculation.&rdquo; Mr. Tilak frankly disbelieved in the
efficacy of a remedy which required the injection of a
poison at every visitation of the plague. He com-
plained of the low vitality of the people, due to poverty
and starvation, and declared that unless that was re-
medied, such epidemics were bound to recur. Partly
as a result of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s opposition, the Government
were wise enough not to resort to compulsion with res-
pect to inoculation. They simply tried to make it
&quot; popular by various means.&rdquo;</p>

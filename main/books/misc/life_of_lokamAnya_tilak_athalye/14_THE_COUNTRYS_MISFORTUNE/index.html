</blockquote>
<p>The arrest of Mr. Tilak, though it caused widespread
grief and resentment did not surprise anybody. What
however extremely surprised all was that such a mild and
innocent article as that of May 12th, 1908 had been
selected for prosecuting Mr. Tilak under Sections 124 A
and 153 A of the Indian Penal Code. The Government
of Bombay seem to have realised the risk of getting
conviction on the article of May 12th and so, another
sanction to prosecute Mr. Tilak for publishing the lead-
ing article in the Kesari of June 9th entitled &quot; These
remedies are not lasting &quot; was given, a fresh warrant
was issued and executed on Mr. Tilak in jail ; and by
two separate orders was Mr. Tilak committed to the
Criminal Sessions of the Bombay High Court on June
29th, 1908.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s misfortunes did not end here. On July
2nd, an application for bail, made on his behalf by Mr,
Jinnah before Mr. Justice Davar was rejected and this
was the more curious, as eleven years back, Mr. Davar</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE I97</p>
<p>^then a barrister, had strongly pleaded in favour of Mr.
Tilak before the late Mr. Justice Tyabji on this very
point. Mr. Davar the Barrister had argued that &quot; the
&lsquo;Only ground on which this application could be opposed
would be an apprehension that the accused might not be
forthcoming for his trial.&rdquo; Mr. Davar, the Judge,
however declared &quot; I am not in accord with the state-
ment, broadly made that the only consideration which
ought to guide the Court in deciding whether bail
should or should not be granted, was the consideration
that the accused would appear to take his trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s next misfortune was the successful appli-
cation of the Crown to the Court for directing that
a Special Jury should be empanelled to try him. Mr.
Baptista, appearing for Mr. Tilak conclusively proved
how, if a Special Jury was empanelled it would consist
of a majority of Europeans, who, besides being ignorant
of Marathi would not be the best Judges of articles
** exciting disaffection against the Government.&rdquo; Mr.
Tilak was moreover charged with exciting the feelings
of Indians against Europeans. The result would be,
said Mr. Baptista, that on the charge under 124 A, the
rulers would sit in judgment upon a subject for his alle-
ged rebellious spirit and under Section 153 A, the
accusers would sit in judgment upon the accused for
exciting hostility against themselves. A Common Jury
would, on the other hand, cons st of a majority of
Non-Europeans. Mr. Baptista&rsquo;s prayer, however, was
not granted and a Special Jury was ordered to be
empanelled.</p>
<p>On Monday, July 13th, when the hearing of the cases
commenced, the Advocate General proposed (Sec. 234</p>
<p>198 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>C. P. Code) to put Up the accused on both the charges at&rsquo;
the same trial ; and to avoid a technical difficulty of
law, he proposed to put the accused up on two charges-
under Section 124 A and one charge under Section.
153 A, staying for a time proceedings under 153 A with
respect to the article of 12th May. This procedure was
prejudicial to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s interests but in spite of his
protests, the joinder of charges was allowed. The result
of this was, as the detailed reports of the proceedings
clearly show% that practically &ldquo;one single article of June
9th was made the ground of three convictions and
sentences on three different charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The * objectionable ' passages on which the prosecu-
tion relied were not specified. Mr. Tilak drew the
attention of the learned Judge to this difficulty. He
was however told that the whole lot of the words was
objected to and with His Lordship&rsquo;s permission, the
charges were amended by putting in the whole articles-
into the charge. This was, of course very convenient
to the Prosecution, but it increased Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s burden
and compelled him to explain each and every sentence
while conducting his defence.</p>
<p>The only prosecution witness seriously cross-exami-
ned by Mr. Tilak, who conducted his own defence, was-
the late Mr. B. V. Joshi, First Assistant to the Oriental
Translator, Bombay. The cross-examination is a model.
of skill and resourcefulness. It reveals Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
command over the Marathi as also his proficiency in all.
the arts of an Advocate. Mr. Tilak completely suc-
ceeded in proving that the transaltions were perverted*
Words likely to be unfavourable to him were grossly
though unintentionally mistranslated ; while expres-</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE igg</p>
<p>sions, which were favourable to him were made consi-
derably milder.</p>
<p>When Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s house was searched, a post-card
containing the names of two books &quot; Hand-book on
Modern Explosives &quot; and &quot; Nitro-explosives &quot; was
found. It was quite natural and proper for the editor
of a newspaper to purchase books on explosives whea
the Government was contemplating legislation on the
subject. *&rsquo; A book is not a bomb, much less the name ot
It.&rdquo; The Post-card, however, received undue promi-
nence and it was put in, as one of the Exhibits by the
Prosecution. To explain the Post-Card, Mr. Tilak had
to put a bundle of sundry papers, by which he lost
his right of reply. Finding that this right, so precious-
to an accused, especially in a trial by Jury, was thus
taken away, Mr. Tilak put in 71 cutting from different
papers, to show how his own articles formed part of a
political controversy.</p>
<p>In his written Statement, Mr. Tilak accepted full res-
ponsibility for the incriminating articles, gave his own
English renderings for some of the Marathi words oc-
curring in the articles, quoted his views on Political
Reform from his statement before the Decentralization
Commission and concluded by saying that the Charge-
Articles formed part of a controversy, in which he had
endeavoured to maintain and defend those views. He
also successfully explained the post-card. He commen-
ced his speech on &ldquo;Wednesday, July 15th, at about 4 P.M.
the speech occupied full 21 hours and 10 minutes,
WTiile it was being delivered, * &quot; The Judge, Jury an(i</p>
<p>• From the Modern Review.</p>
<p>200 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>the Prosecuting Counsel shrank into insignificance be-
fore the towering personahty of Mr. Tilak.&rdquo; It was a
nice discourse on the law of sedition both Indian and
English ; and though Mr. Tilak did not succeed in
convincing the Judge and the majority of the Jurors,
still &quot; on his countrymen at large, the speech produced
an elevating effect.'* After reading out Section 124 A,
under which two charges were framed against him, Mr.
Tilak said, &quot; This Section is divided into two parts.
The first part refers to actually bringing into hatred or
contempt His Majesty etc. But as there is no evidence
before the Court that any excitement has been caused
by the articles in question, so it seems to me that the
Prosecution does not mean to proceed under that part
of the section. The second part of the Section deals
with ' attempts to excite disaffection &lsquo;. The Section
does not simply refer to the publication of anything
likely to create disaffection. * An attempt is an inten-
tional premeditated action, which if it fails in its objects,
fails through circumstances independent of the person,
who seeks its accomplishment.&rsquo; Attempt is actually
an offence, minus the final act of crime. The mere fact
that a certain article is published will not make it an
attempt. There must be a criminal mind, a culpable
indifference to consequences. In the present case, there
has been no evidence to prove that the attempt failed
because, the Government interfered or because the
people refused to listen. Attempt includes both mo-
tives and intention. To take a common illustration, I
intend to go the Bori Bunder Station and my end in
view is to go to Poona. In deciding intention, it is
not safe to follow the maxim of the Civil Law * every</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE 201</p>
<p>man must be presumed to intend the natural conse-
quences of his acts.&rsquo; My contention is supported by
the caseofRex z;s.Baru3,Hyndmanaai^Or3 which was
tried by Justice Cave who in his charge to the Jury
said :</p>
<p>' I am unable to agree entirely with the Attorney-
General when he says that the real charge is that
though these men did not incite or contemplate disorder
yet as it was the natural consequence of the words they
used, they are responsible for it. In order to make out
the offence of speaking seditious words, there must be a
criminal intent upon the part of the accused ; there must
be words, spoken with a seditious intent ; and although
it is a good working rule to say that a man must be
taken to intend the natural consequences of his acts,
yet if it is shown from other circumstances that he did
not actually intend them, I do not see how you can ask
a Jury to act upon what has become a legal fic-
tion. * * * * j]^Q maxim that a man intends the
natural consequences of his acts is usually true, but it
may be used as a way of saying that, because reckless
indifference to probable consequences is morally as bad
as an intention to produce these consequences, the two
things ought to be called by the same name and this is
at least an approach to legal fiction. It is one thing
to write with a distinct intention to produce disturbance
and another to write, violently and recklessly, matter
likely to produce disturbances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Criminal intention cannot be presumed but must be
positively proved by the evidence of surrounding cir-
cumstances. The motive of an act must not be con-
■&rdquo; ^ »</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>202 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>founded with the intention ; but is always one of the
surest indications in an inquiry as to intention. If the-
writer&rsquo;s motives are good, if he is trying to secure
constitutional rights for the people, trying in a
fair way and persevering manner, he is entitled
to express his views fully and fearlessly. Intention
may be inferred from the legal fiction that a
man intends the natural consequences of his acts.
But if there are circumstances to show that the-
motive of a man is different, then the mere fact
that the views of the writer are not correct, or are even
absurd, or that he has expressed them in violent lan-
guage, would not make him seditious. It is not a
question of the correctness and acceptability of views^
or of the stylef in which they have been expressed.
The incriminating articles form part of a controversy
between the Pro-Bureaucratic party and the Pro-
Congress party. There was a bomb outrage at Mozuf-
ferpore. There was no difference of opinion as to the
character of the deplorable event ; but the question was</p>
<ul>
<li>what is the cause of it ?&rsquo; The Pro-Bureaucratic
Party laid the blame at the doors of the Congress or of
the Nationalist Party and called upon Government to
put us down. I have taken the other side. My wri-
tings are (i) a reply to the Anglo-Indian criticism (2)
a suggestion to Government and addressed to Govern-
ment (3) a discussion of the situation (4) a warning to
both parties which, it is my duty as a journalist to give
(5) a criticism of the contemplated measures by the
Government. I will read extracts from a few Anglo-
Indian writings. The Pioneer of May 7th recommends-
a whole-sale arrest of the acknowledged Terrorists in a</li>
</ul>
<p>THE COUNTRY S MISFORTUNE 20^</p>
<p>city or District, coupled with an intimation that on the-
repetition of the offence, ten of them would be shot for
every life sacrificed. It tries to establish a logical con-^
nection between members of the Council and Bomb-
throwers in Bengal. The Asian recommends to Mr.
Kingsford&rsquo;s notice a Mauser pistol and hopes he would
secure a big * bag &lsquo;, adding that he will be more than
justified in letting day-light into every strange native
approaching his house or person. A correspondent of
the Englishman suggests that * a few of these worthy
agitators should be flogged in public by the town-sweep-
ers.&rsquo; Now, we honestly believed that these writings-
were mischievous, particularly the insinuations of those
writers and they had to be counteracted. My reply
to the Anglo-Indian Press is written on an occasiou
of provocation. It does not intend to excite dis-affection.
For every sentence in my writings, I can point out a
parallel passage from the literature of our party. Pro-
Congress Newspapers, completely hostile to the Kesariy
take the same view of the matter. I am charged spe-
cifically with attempting to cause excitement, not
through-out India, but among the Marathi-speaking
population. I do not stand alone in my views. Papers
of all parties in the Marathi-speaking community have
taken the same view of the matter. This absolves me
from any evil intention. If there is no personal preju-
dice against me, these articles will show that I was not
prompted by my personal prejudices. The arguments
have not been invented by me. In charging me with
sedition, this must be borne in mind * what impressions
will my writings produce on the Marathi speaking
public ?&rsquo; All they say is, ' well, the reply has been-</p>
<p>204 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>well given/ I have been writing nothing which I have
not written for 28 years ; and the view expressed in my
article has been already expressed by some leaders of
our party. Taking all these points into consideration,
the construction put upon the words of the articles by
the Prosecution is unjustifiable. Moreover, in my own
interest, and in the interest of the cause I represent I
am bound to question the translations, which are com-
pletely distorted. It is simply intolerable that con-
viction for sedition should be based upon such trans-
lations. If I succeeded in showing that the wording of
these translations is not correct, that in itself is enough
to ensure my acquittal. The words on which the Pro-
secution is likely to rely are found to be distorted
images of the original words. Marathi terminology in
the discussion of Political subjects not being settled, I
have been required to labour under a very great dis-
advantage, especially as, frequently we have to write
on the spur of the moment ; and the translator has made
an attempt to translate the Marathi language of 1908
with the aid of a dictionary published full fifty years
ago, not realizing that old fortifications cannot stand
before new guns. I gave Mr. Joshi this sentence to
translate &quot; A despotic Government need not necessarily
be tyrannical,&rdquo; and the translator himself found it diffi-
cult to express the two shades of meaning in Marathi.
The charge is based not upon the original Marathi but
upon the translations. Therefore the Prosecution
must stand or fall by the correctness or incorrectness
of the translations. It is likely to be urged ' take away
the Bureaucracy and what hope is left ?&rsquo; But I submit,
the Bureaucracy is not the Government. The Bomb-</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE 205-</p>
<p>outrages were quickly condemned in my papers, as
the Anglo-Indian papers. But in condemning them^
we say that we must also condemn the repres-
sive measures of Government. Both parties are
taking advantage of the presence of the bomb. The
Bureaucratic Party are taking advantage of it to
suppress political agitation, and the other party is
taking advantage of it to claim some reforms. It is
the same question which was fought out by Erskine
in the case of the Dean of St. Asaph. I can trace a
great struggle between the people on the one hand^
and a mighty Bureaucracy on the other ; and I ask
you to help us, not me personally, but the whole of
India. I am now on the wrong side of life and for
me it can only be a matter of a few years, but future
generations will look to your verdict and see whether
you have judged right or not. If at least one of yoa
would come forward and say that I was right, it will
be a matter of satisfaction to me ; for I know, that if
the Jury are not unanimous in England, another trial
takes place. It is not so here, but it would be a
moral support upon which I would rely with great satis-
faction. I appeal to you, not for myself, but in the
interest of the cause which I have the honour to re-
present. It is the cause that is sacred and I doubt
not, gentlemen, that He, before whom all of us will
have to stand one day and render an account of our
actions will inspire you with the courage of 3&rsquo;our con-
victions and help you in arriving at a right decision on
the issue involved in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to adequately summarize the whole
of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s masterly address within the limits at our</p>
<p>206 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>disposal. His disquisitions on Section 153A, and his
running commentary on the incriminating articles
must be completely dropped. What has been at-
tempted above is a bare outline of some of the princi-
ple points which he pressed in his favour. He finish-
ed his address at about 12-30 p.m., on the eighth and
last date of the trial (Wednesday, 22nd July 1908).
The reply of the Advocate-General was severely satiri-
cal and extremely offensive. He himself seems to
have been conscious that he had exceeded the bounds
of decorum and in conclusion declared himself to be
ready to stand by any rebuke, which His Lordship
might offer to him. Some of the gems in his speech
are worth recording : —</p>
<p>&quot; You have been told, that you are guardians of
the Press. Fiddlesticks ! You are guardians
of the Penal Code and the Penal Code protects
the Press.&rdquo;
&quot; He (Mr. Tilak) has been trying his best to
throw all the dust he could collect, even in the
monsoon weather, into j^our eyes on this point.
It is not what he now says he meant, but what
he meant when he wrote them (the articles)</p>
<p>that matters He cannot be allowed</p>
<p>' to say now ' of course I wrote sedition and
' ^ meant affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&quot; Can you conceive anybody with the faintest
knowledge of law putting forward such a sug-
gestion seriously, that he was entitled to write
these articles in self-defence ? This is the
right that Mr. Tilak put forward in his defence
yesterday. I think the accused must have</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE 20/</p>
<p>laughed, when he left the Court, after having
put forward that defence, to think that it was
received in silence instead of Homeric laugh-
ter.&rdquo;
&quot; I had intended to avoid the language of passion.
But having the misfortune to sit through
these ravings from morning to morning etc.&rdquo;
Strong exception could have been taken to such
&quot;&rdquo; ravings &quot; and Mr. Tilak was nothing, if not extre-
mely jealous of his rights. But he disdained to cri-
ticise the satirical language which Mr. Branson used
in his speech, which lasted for four hours. The
Judge thought it desirable to finish the case that day</p>
<ul>
<li>— or rather that night ; and so, perhaps the Advocate-
General brought his remarks to a hurried close. The
Summing-up of the Judge followed — in lamp light, —
and it was an adverse charge to the Jury. The Jury
retired for consideration at about 8 p.m., and returned
at 9-20 P.M. During the dismal silence of more than
one hour in the dim gas-light, every friendly heart
quailed. The finger on the wall was but too clear;
Mr. Tilak, however, was always peculiarly
heroic in such moments and in a whisper gave expres-
sion to his feelings in the noble words of Lord Krishna</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;If you are defeated, you rule heaven ; if you
win, the world is at your feet.&rdquo; At last, the suspense
was over. The Jurors came out and announced the
majority verdict of guilty on all charges. They were
divided by 7 to 2 ; the Judge agreed with their ver-
dict and before passing any sentence, asked the accused
whether he wished to say anything before sentence</p>
<p>208 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>was passed. Here was an opportunity for Mr. Tilak
to withdraw his remarks or express regret for hi&amp;
conduct and attitude. But his spirit was unbending ;
his cause was sacred and invincible. &quot; In a solemn
and piercing tone &quot; he uttered the following words
which deserve to be written in letters of gold : —
<em>&rsquo; All I wish to say is that in spite of the verdict
of the Jury, I maintain that I am innocent.
There are higher Powers that rule the desti-
nies of things ; and it may be the will of the
Providence that the cause which I represent
may prosper more by my sufferings than by
my remaining free.&rdquo;
Let us compare these words with those of the
Judge, when he sentenced the accused to six years</em>
Transportation (three years on each charge of sedition)
to which a fine of Rs. i,ooo (on the third charge) was
added: — &ldquo;It is my painful duty to pass sentence upon
you. I cannot tell you how painful it is to me to see you
in this position. You are a man of undoubted talents
and great power and influence. Those talents and
that influence, if used for the good of your country,
would have been instrumental in bringing about a
great deal of happiness for those very people whose
cause you espouse. Ten years ago you were con-
victed and the Court dealt most leniently with you
and the Crown dealt still more kindly with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that it must be a diseased
mind, a most perverted intellect, that could say that
the articles, which you have written are legitimate
weapons in political agitation. They are seething
with sedition, they preach violence ; they speak ol</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE 209</p>
<p>murders with approval ; and the cowardly and atro-
cious act of committing murders with bombs not only
seems to meet with your approval, but you hail the
advent of the bomb in India as if something has
come to India for its good. As I said it can be only
a diseased and perverted mind that can think that
bombs are legitimate instruments in political agita-
tions. And it must be a diseased mind that could
ever have thought that the articles you wrote were
articles that could have been legitimately written.
Your hatred of the Ruling Class has not disappeared
during these ten years. And in these articles, delibe-
rately and defiantly written week by week, not as
you say, on the spur of the moment, but a fortnight
after that cruel and cowardly outrage had been com-
mitted upon two innocent English women, you wrote
about bombs as if they were legitimate instruments
in political agitations. Such journalism is a curse
to the country. I feel much sorrow in sentencing
you. I have considered most anxiously in the case
of a verdict being returned against you, what sen-
tence I should pass upon you. * * * Having re-
gard to your age and circumstances, I think it is
most desirable, in the interest of peace and order and
in the interest of the country which you profess to
love, that you should be out of it for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When on the morrow, July 23rd, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s 53rd
birthday, the news of his conviction spread like wild
fire, most impressive demonstrations were witnessed.
The bazars were spontaneously closed ; schools and
colleges were deserted. The Mill-hands of Bombay
struck work for six days in honour of Mr. Tilak.
14</p>
<p>210 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Condolence meetings were held all over the country;
Many of the Moderate leaders were ungenerous not
to take part therein. A notable instance is that of
Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. The Hon. Mr. Gokhale,
(then in England), too, stood aloof from a condolence
meeting in London. He was requested to preside on
the occassion, but he refused to take any part in the
meeting ; nor did he organize a meeting of his own,
for the same purpose. This attitude of Mr. Gokhale
created an impression that he and his associates were
pledged to support a policy of repression. ^1,^</p>
<p>In noticing Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s conviction, the London
Times said : —</p>
<p>&quot; The real importance of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s conviction
lies in the fact that he is the acknowledged and un-
disputed leader of the Extremists&rsquo; Movement in India.
That he had a guilty knowledge of the darker deve-
lopments of that movement is not, of course, sug-
gested. Mr. Tilak remained, at the moment of his
-conviction, the most conspicuous politician in India
and among large sections of the people, he has enjoy-
ed a popularity and wielded an influence that no
other public matt in the Dependency could claim to
equal. The Extremists&rsquo; Movement, in its open mani-
festitations both within and outside the Congress
was ahnost entirely his conception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian Press was almost unanimously of opi-
nion that Mr. Tilak did not get justice. But the
Full Bench of the Bombay High Court as also the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, thought
that he had ; — and there we must leave the
question.</p>
<p>THE country&rsquo;s MISFORTUNE 211</p>
<p>As soon as the sentence was pronounced and the
Judge had left the Court, Mr. Tilak was taken charge
©f by the PoUce and was sent to Sabarmati gaol to
celebrate his 53rd birth-day (23rd July 1908). He
was treated just like a common convict; and it was
only when ten days of jail diet brought down his
weight by 10 lbs. that apprehension was felt concerning
his health, and a gentleman&rsquo;s diet was given to
him.</p>
<p>From Sabarmati, he was removed (Sept. 13th, 1908)
to Mandalay. His sentence was commuted to one of
simple imprisonment. This &lsquo;* act of grace &quot; acted pre-
judicially to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s interests. Had the original
sentence been executed, he would have got greater
remission. Besides, in the Andamans he would have
been able to Uve in perfect freedom after furnishing
the usual security. While, at Mandalay, he had to confine
himself, for six long years, to a room measuring
20x12. He represented these facts to the authorities,
but to no purpose.</p>
<p>When Mr. Tilak was sentenced to transportation for
six years, there were few, even among his opponents
who expected him to survive the term of his exile.
Two things however, besides his own fortitude and
Faith in God, enabled him to outlive the dread mo-
notony and killing soUtude of his life. They were (i)
health and {2) mental occupation. But these, in their
turn depended upon things quite beyond his control.
The Government, however, was pleased to deal with
him leniently. He was allowed to have his own food
cooked by a Brahmin convict specially kept at his
disposal; and when diabetes raised its head, he could</p>
<p>212 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>change it and have the special diet which he had after
careful research, found suitable for diabetic patients.</p>
<p>As regards mental occupation, though all books or
periodicals bearing on current Politics were rigourously
excluded, Mr. Tilak could yet command the free use of
other books and of writing materials. &quot; Though con-
j&amp;ned in a room of 20X12 he could, if he liked, go out
hunting with the primeval Aryan warriors in the
Rigveda; enjoy the super glory of the Aurora with the
Pole-Star at zenith overhead; busy himself with the
ritual mysteries of the Vedic sacrificers gathered around
their sacred Vedis; revel in the prospective clash of
arms, when the numberless armies of the Pandavas
and the Kauravas met on the bloodthirsty Kurukshetra;
hsten to the Song Celestial as it was delivered in divine
accents by Krishna to Arjuna; or take a tour round
the world in company with the authors of the
Historians&rsquo; History of the World.&rdquo; When so much
' latitude ' was given to him, surely Mr. Tilak had no
&quot; right to complain ! &quot;</p>
<p>Even the longest night has an end; and Mr. Tilak
who received neither the benefit of the Delhi Durbar
(1911) nor that of the usual remission was at long last
secretly brought from Mandalay and liberated in front
of his residence at midnight on June i6th, 19 14 !</p>

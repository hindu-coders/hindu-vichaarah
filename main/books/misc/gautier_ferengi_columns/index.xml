      <description>THE FERENGI’S COLUMNS
 (A Western journalist opening his eyes to the true India)
By François Gautier
dedicated: &amp;ldquo;to Sri Sri &amp;quot;
The author wishes to express his gratitude to Sudheendra Kulkarni, one time editor of Blitz; to Mr. Narayanan, editor of the Hindustan Times, when it was still a versatile newspaper; and to Shekhar Gupta, editor of the Indian Express, who stuck by him in spite of a lot of internal resistance !</description>

      <description>1. AYODHYA
Ayodhya marks my political awakening. It is there that for the first time I came in contact with this strange phenomenon of Indian politics (which repeats itself all over the world): that what appears true, may often turn out to be false or is at best a half-truth; and that which seems false, or politically not correct, often turns out to be a truth. Journalism has to be a first-hand experience; that is, the correspondent should be able to judge what he has been asked to report – not through the prism of his atavism, set ideas and prejudices which he brings with him - but thanks to an inner intuition towards which he has constantly to aspire.</description>

      <description>2. KASHMIR : A DEAD-END AND A SOLUTION
Nothing symbolizes better the absurdity of Partition than Kashmir. Nehru and Gandhi’s folly of accepting the division of the country on geographical-religion lines has come back to haunt India with a vengeance. For, Pakistan, apart from the fact that it was created and survives on its hatred of ‘Hindu’ India, has a point: if Nehru accepted that Muslim-dominated parts of India go to Pakistan, why not also the Valley of Kashmir, which is today in Muslim majority, thanks to decades of terror to induce the once strong Hindu community to flee ?</description>

      <description>3. THE CHRISTIANS : A MINORITY IN MORAL MAJORITY
Many of us in the West – at least those born in the forties and early fifties – grew-up hearing of the wonderful and ‘saintly’ work done by the &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; missionaries in far away and dangerous (that is jungle and snake-infested) countries, where lived &amp;ldquo;Savages&amp;rdquo;, waiting to be converted to the civilizing influence of Christianity. The reality which I discovered in India was totally different: while there is no doubt that Christian missionaries have done a remarkable work in the fields of education and health, their prime purpose remains - even today - to convert the ‘heathen’ Hindus to the True God – by any means.</description>

      <description>4. THE HINDUS : A MAJORITY IN MORAL MINORITY
Here you have a huge majority of 850 million people, part of a culture which is thousands of years old. A culture which has proved over the ages its infinite tolerance towards other creeds and religions, giving refuge to all persecuted minorities in the world, whether Parsis, Syrian Christians, Jews, or Tibetans today. Yet Hindu-bashing has become a favorite pastime of the Press, both Indian and Foreign – and when you find someone such as Murli Manohar Joshi who wants to Indianize Indian education, an aspiration which would be found natural in any country, he is run down by his own people.</description>

      <description>5. THE INDIAN MEDIA: AN HOSTILE FORCE
Indian journalists must be held responsible in some degree for the slow progresses India has made in regaining her self-confidence, shattered by centuries of colonization. For Indian journalists are often the worst enemies of India and Indian culture, constantly harping at the negative sides of India, constantly ignoring the greatness of this country. They must also be the biggest Hindu-bashers in a nation where there are already so many Hindu bashers (Marxists, Muslims, Christians, politicians), having since Independence, made fun in the most belittling manner of Hindu culture.</description>

      <description>6. THE (UNFRIENDLY) NEIGHBOURS IN ASIA
India is surrounded mostly by unfriendly neighbors. We see either Islamic countries promoting a rabid anti-Hindu policy, such as Afghanistan or Pakistan; or small inconsequent nations such as Nepal, which owe so much to India, yet often harbor India’s enemies, as shown by the Indian Airlines hijack of December 1999. Further East, we find Japan, which has a sad hegemonic history, but was one of the most vociferous nations against India after Pokhran II</description>

      <description>7. THE WEST AND INDIA
The West, if it does not always show outright hostility to India, often displays aggressive ignorance – the United States being the prime example – although things are changing thanks to Clinton’s 1999 visit. France, a country which had a huge sympathy capital in India, has not exploited it because it is obsessed with China. On the friendly side, the countries are very few : there is Israel, which shares so much with India, yet has been ignored for decades to please the Arabs; or non-communist Russia, which is discovering anew that she and India are fighting a lonely battle against Muslim fundamentalism.</description>

      <description>8. EXAMPLES NOT TO FOLLOW
There are three countries which offer to India examples not to follow: East Timor, Yugoslavia and Tibet. East Timor showed how converted Christians provoke secession by alleging &amp;ldquo;persecution&amp;rdquo; and how the West has a very short memory. Pundits have predicted for decades the balkanisation of India, as it happened in Yugoslavia at the hands of Kosovo; so far it has not materialised, but if India allows Kashmir to go, who knows what might follow.</description>

      <description>9. THE FALSE GODS
The Indian mind’s spontaneous tendency is that of bhakti, of worshipping ‘That’ which it feels is above himself. While it is a wonderful trait which has brought an innocence and a freshness to the Indian psyche, it has been taken advantage in modern times by politicians, Christian missionaries and intellectuals. Mother Teresa, the Mahatma Gandhi, Rama Rao, or Sonia Gandhi, while they may have been outstanding personalities in their own right, have all, consciously or unconsciously exploited this innocence, whereas they did not always deserved the status of Gods or semi-Gods given to them.</description>

      <description>10. THE GREAT INDIAN MYTHS
Since independence a few Great Indian Myths have done immeasurable harm to the country. Yet not only do they survive today, but they are often reborn under different avatars. One of these enduring myths concerns Ashoka the Great embracing Buddhism, and making it a State religion. Another of these other extremely pernicious myths is the Great Indo-Chinese friendship, which even the BJP today seems to sometimes believe in.</description>

      <description>11. THE ROT OF BOLLYWOOD
It is no coincidence that Pakistan, in connivance with Indian Muslims and the covert approval of Saudi Arabia, chose Bombay to plant their deadly bombs after the destruction of the mosque of Ayodhya. For there has always been a strong connection between the Muslims of Bombay, with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, via the film industry (isn’t it, Mr Dilip Kumar?). We all know how Indian actors and actresses used to be invited at Dawood Ibrahim’s parties and today we have discovered how black ‘blood’ money is utilized to finance many of Bollywood mega-films.</description>

      <description>12. INDIA: EVERYTHING THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE
India is also the opposite of whatever it should be: so much appears to have gone wrong in this country, everything has been perverted. And if we had to name the horror that is India, we would say: the VIP culture; Delhi an arrogant, superficial and polluted city; tourism where the foreigner is a cow to be milked by the Government; there are also much more than one billion human beings in India, whatever the Official census says; and finally, India might be going towards an ecological pralaya –a and nobody in this country gives a damn, certainly not the NGO’s who are too busy making money out of India’s poverty.</description>

      <description>13. THE HIDDEN TREASURES
If only India knew the treasure trove hidden in her midst! There is a knowledge here, which has been lost to the world; there is a spiritual fervor in this country, which is found nowhere in this degree on this planet; there is a diversity of cultural and social expression in India, which is unique in an increasingly unipolar world. We have chosen four stories to illustrate this point: pranayama the science of breathing; the astounding festival of Ayappa; kalaripayat, the ancestor of all great Asian martial arts; and the jallikatu festival in Madurai.</description>

      <description>14. THE RENAISSANCE OF INDIA
There is no doubt that under Prime Minister Vajpayee, India had entered her Golden Period, her second Renaissance. But will the BJP remain faithful to its original aspirations, or will it become &amp;ldquo;Congressized&amp;rdquo; as Nostradamus has predicted? Do Indians even know about their own civilization and how it influenced the whole world at one time? Unfortunately schools and universities&amp;rsquo; curriculums teach a very bland and westernized outlook on India and one man, Murali Manohar Joshi, is fighting a lonely battle so that Indian children can learn to be proud of their own countries.</description>

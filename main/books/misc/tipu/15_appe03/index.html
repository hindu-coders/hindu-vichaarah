<p><strong>Coram: S.C. Pratap &amp; A.V. Savant, JJ,</strong></p>
<p>Thursday, 30th August, 1990.<br>
Oral Order: (Per S.C. Pratap, J.)</p>
<p>1. This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is directed
against the TV serial &ldquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2. Mr. M.D. Pathak, learned Counsel for the petition has, vehemently
and with courage of his conviction, put forth before us the point of
view of the petitioners and what, according to Mr. Pathak, large section
of the Indian society considers and feels about this serial. He has
invited our attention to a passage from the <em>Kerala District
Gazetteers</em>, published by the Government of Kerala in 1962 as also
passages from the <em>Mysore Gazetteer</em>, compiled for the Government and
published in the year 1930. We decline to comment thereon but
simpliciter reproduce the same in fairness to the petitioners. The
passage from the <em>Kerala District Gazetteers</em> runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; ….In a proclamation issued to the people in 1788 he outlined his new
scheme of social reform as follows: &lsquo;From the period of the conquest
until this day, during twenty-four years, you have been a turbulent
and refractory people, and in the wars waged during your rainy season,
you have caused number of our warriors to taste the draught of
martyrdom. Be it so. What is past is past. Hereafter you must proceed
in an opposite manner, dwell quietly and pay your dues like good
subjects and since it is the practice with you for one woman to
associate with ten men, and you leave your mothers and sisters
unconstrained in their obscene practices, and are thence all born in
adultery, and are more shameless in your connections than the beasts
of the fields: I hereby require you to forsake these sinful practices
and be like the rest of mankind; and if you are disobedient to these
commands, I have made repeated vows to honour the whole of you with
Islam and to march all the chief persons to the seat of Government.&rdquo;
Tipu&rsquo;s proclamation created universal resentment and the whole country
rose in rebellion. Fearing forcible conversion about 30,000 Brahmins
alone fled to Travancore. The Kottayam and Kadattanand Rajas sought
the English East India Company&rsquo;s protection. Calicut was attacked in
November, 1788. Tipu&rsquo;s officers laid hands on the Karanavappad of
Manjeri. The Nairs of Calicut and South Malabar headed by Ravi Varma
and other princes of the Padinjare Kovilakam turned in despair on
their oppressors. Tipu set 6,000 troops under M. Lally to raise the
siege, but Ravi Varma could not be driven out of the field.</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1789, Tipu himself came down to Malabar via the
Tamarasseri Ghat to enforce his proclamation at the point of his
sword. General orders were issued to his army that &lsquo;every being in the
district without distinction should be burned, that they should be
traced to their lurking places, and that all means of truth and
falsehood, force or fraud should be employed to effect their universal
conversion&rsquo;. The Kadattanad Raja&rsquo;s fortified palace at Kuttipuram was
surrounded and 2,000 Nairs, forced to surrender after a resistance of
several days, were circumcised and regaled with beef. Several. Rajas
and rich land owners fled to Travancore where the Dharma Raja rendered
them all help to rehabilitate themselves in their new surroundings.
The poor Nairs, however, retreated into the jungles and were
relentlessly pursued by Mysorean troops. From their jungle homes the
Nairs could engage themselves in a kind of guerrilla warfare against
the enemy forces. Hence Tipu organised a regular and systematic Nair
hunt with the help of his soldiers. He then proceeded to Cannanore and
after celebrating the marriage of his son with the daughter of the Ali
Raja, marched along the coast of Chowghat to overawe the native
population by a show of his power. From there he retired to Coimbatore
after making arrangements for the administrative reorganisation of the
province and leaving a permanent army of occupation to frighten the
population into passive submission.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. The passages from the <em>Mysore Gazetteer</em> are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. &ldquo;The reversion of Mangalore to the possession of Tipu was
signalized by the forcible circumcision of many thousands of Indian
Christians and their deportation to Seringapatam. A revolt in Coorg
next year led to the same treatment of the greater part of the
inhabitants the occasion being marked by Tipu&rsquo;s assumption of the tide
of Badshah. All Brahman endowments were at this period resumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b. &ldquo;In January 1788 Tipu descended to Malabar, and remained there
several months arranging for its effective administration and the
reformation of its people, calling upon them either to give up their
sinful practices or be honoured with Islam. He also ordered the
destruction of Calicut and the erection of a new fortress of the name
of Furruckku (Feroke), and then marched to Coimbatore in the monsoon.
He also now began to lay claim on the tide of Paighambar, or apostle,
on the ground of his religious successes, and symptoms of incipient
madness, it is said, appeared. From Coimbatore he visited Dindigul,
and meditated, it appears, the conquest of Travancore. Laying waste
with fire and sword the territories of refractory palegars, he
returned to Seringapatam, and devoted four months to a classification
of Sayyids and Sheks in his army to distinct brigades, leaving for the
time being the Patans and Moghuls to be intermixed with the Hindus. A
simultaneous rebellion occurred now in Coorg and Malabar, and the
Sultan, passing through Coorg to quiet it, entered Malabar. Large
parties of the Nairs were surrounded and offered the alternative of
death or circumcision. The Nair Raja of Cherkal, who had voluntarily
submitted, was received and dismissed with distinction, but
immediately after, on a false charge of conspiracy, was killed in a
skirmish, his corpse being treated with every insult. Over 8,000
temples were also desecrated, their roofs of gold, silver and copper
and the treasures buried under the idols amounting to many lakhs,
being treated as royal plunder. Before leaving Malabar, Tipu visited
Cannanore, where the daughter of the Beebee was betrothed to one of
his sons. He also divided the country of Malabar into districts, each
of which had three officers, charged respectively with the duties of
collecting the revenue, numbering the productive trees, and seizing
and giving religious instructions to Nairs. His orders were, that
&lsquo;every being in the district, without distinction, should be honoured
with Islam; that the houses of such as fled to avoid that honour
should be burned; that they should be traced to their lurking places,
and that all means of truth and falsehood, fraud or force, should be
employed&rsquo; to effect their universal conversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>c. &ldquo;…On the handle of the sword presented by him to Marquess Wellesly
was the following inscription:<br>
My victorious sabre is lightning for the destruction of the
unbelievers. Haider, the Lord of Faith, is victorious for my
advantage. And moreover, he destroyed the wicked race who were
unbelievers. Praise be to him, who is the Lord of the Worlds! Thou art
our Lord, support us against the people who are unbelievers. He to
whom the Lord giveth victory prevails over all (mankind). Oh Lord,
make him victorious, who promoteth the faith of Muhammad. Confound
him, who refuseth the faith of Muhammad; and withhold us from those
who are so inclined. The Lord is predominant over his own works.
Victory and conquest are from the Almighty. Bring happy tidings, Oh
Muhammad, to the faithful; for God is the kind protector and is the
most merciful of the merciful. If God assists thee, thou will prosper.
May the Lord God assist thee, Oh Muhammad, with mighty victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>d. &ldquo;On some gold medals, also found in the palace, the following
legend, in Persian, was seen on one side: &ldquo;Of God the bestower of
blessings and the other, victory and conquest are from the Almighty&rdquo;.
Apparently they were carved in commemoration of some victory probably
after the war of 1780. The following is a translation of an
inscription on the stone found at Seringapatam, which was to have been
set up in a conspicuous place in the fort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Almighty God! dispose the whole body of infidels! Scatter their
tribe, cause their feet to stagger! Overthrow their councils, change
their state, destroy their very root! Cause death to be near them, cut
off from them the means of sustenance! Shorten their days! Be their
bodies the constant object of their cares (i.e. infest them with
diseases), deprive their eyes of sight, make black their faces (i.e.
bring shame).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. Mr. Pathak also referred to the compilation which, according to the
learned Counsel, contains some letters by Tipu himself. This compilation
is styled as <em>Tipu Sultan X-rayed</em> by Dr. Muthanna and published in the
year 1980. We are, however, not inclined to reproduce the contents
thereof in this order.</p>
<p>5. Mr. Pathak also invited our attention to the following statement of
the producer Mr. Sanjay Khan in paragraph 5 of his affidavit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The petitioners have by an amendment to their contempt petition
alleged that the handle of &lsquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&rsquo; bore an
inscription as set out in para 14 B. I deny that the original Sword of
Tipu Sultan bore any such inscription as alleged or at all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Pathak submits that the sword of Tipu Sultan does bear an
inscription and the same is as per the extract embodied in paragraph 14
B. He further submitted that the original sword is still there in the
Government Museum at Mysore and the inscription can even now be checked.
He also referred to Mr. K.R. Malkani&rsquo;s report which <em>inter alia</em>
contains the following recommendation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, because of the reported excesses of Tipu in Coorg and Kerala,
there is a strong feeling, particularly in Kerala, against a Tipu TV
serial, I, therefore, suggest the following. Tipu&rsquo;s sword used to carry
an offensive engraving, as was probably the custom in those times. It
is, therefore, suggested that the title of the serial be changed from
&lsquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&rsquo; to just &lsquo;Tipu Sultan&rsquo;. A few years back when
equestrian statue of Shivaji was to be put up in Minto Park, New Delhi,
the Government suggested that the statue need not carry a sword; the
sponsors agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. Since Mr. Malkani&rsquo;s report was heavily relied upon by the Government
itself and as there was deviation from his recommendation regarding the
serial title, we have, on the last occasion, suggested to the producer&rsquo;s
learned Counsel, Mr. Bharucha, to consider whether the words &ldquo;The Sword
of&rdquo; could be deleted retaining the title as &ldquo;Tipu Sultan&rdquo;. However, on
taking instructions, he informed us today that it would not be possible
to do so. Be that as it may, we do not wish to pursue this aspect any
further.</p>
<p>7. The main question is: In a case such as this what is the scope and
ambit of the power of judicial review? Unfortunately for the
petitioners, this question is no longer <em>res integra</em>. Tests and
parameters stand already laid down by the Supreme Court in as many as
three decisions. The first ruling is <em>Ramesh Chotalal Dalal v. Union of
India and others</em>, AIR 1988 SUPREME COURT 755 relating to the serial
&ldquo;Tamas&rdquo;. The second decision is the one in <em>Odyssey Communications Pvt.
Ltd. v. Lokvidyan Sanghatana and others</em>, AIR 1988 SUPREME COURT 1643 in
the matter of the serial &ldquo;Honi Anhoni&rdquo;. And the third is the one in S.
Rangarajan v. P. Jagjivan Ram and others (1989) 2 Supreme Court Cases
574, overruling a Division Bench ruling of the Madras High Court
reported in AIR 1989 Madras 149. In view of the law laid down by the
Supreme Court in its rulings <em>supra</em> we feel it unnecessary to trek and
traverse the same terra-firma over again.</p>
<p>8. As a result, the petition fails and the same is dismissed.</p>
<p>9. Mr. Pathak prays for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. However,
as order on this petition is based on the rulings of the Supreme Court
itself, leave to appeal is declined.</p>

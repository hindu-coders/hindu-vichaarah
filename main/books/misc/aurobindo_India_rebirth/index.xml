      <description>Editors&#39; Note
 This book presents Sri Aurobindo&amp;rsquo;s vision of India as it grew from his return from England in 1893 to his political days in the first decade of the century and finally to his forty-year-long withdrawal from public view during which he plunged into his “real work” of evolutionary action.
This brief chronological selection from all that Sri Aurobindo said or wrote on India, her soul and her destiny, is by no means integral, but we trust it offers a sufficiently wide view of the lines of development Sri Aurobindo wished India to follow if she was to overcome the deep-rooted obstacles standing in the way of her rebirth.</description>

1893-1910
(After thirteen years in England where he received a thoroughly Western education, Sri Aurobindo returned to India on February 6, 1893, at the age of twenty.
Bankim Chatterji&amp;rsquo;s Anandamath, which contained “Bande Mataram,” the hymn to the Motherland, had been published eleven years earlier. Swami Vivekananda had just come to the end of his first pilgrimage round India, and was preparing to sail for America. But it was going to take another dozen years for their call to their countrymen to find expression in the political field.</description>

1910-1922
(On April 4, 1910, Sri Aurobindo, still wanted by the British, reached Pondicherry clandestinely. A third charge of sedition against him, for an article in the Karmayogin, failed in his absence. For several years he was going to live in this French colony as a fugitive, with spies and rumours hovering about him and his small group of companions.
For some time Sri Aurobindo thought of returning to British India, but he soon saw that “enough had been done to change the whole face of Indian politics and the whole spirit of the Indian people to make independence its aim,” as he wrote later.</description>

1923-1926
(In these years, Sri Aurobindo used to have daily talks with a few disciples on a wide variety of subjects, from his yoga to the prevailing national or international situation. The following excerpts from these talks, noted down from memory by some of the disciples present, provide glimpses of Sri Aurobindo&amp;rsquo;s views on India&amp;rsquo;s political, social, cultural systems and her spiritual possibilities.)
April 9, 1923
 The ancients \[in India\] based their society on the structure  of religion—I do not mean narrow religion but the highest law of our being.</description>

1929-1938
(At the end of 1926, Sri Aurobindo withdrew completely, leaving the material responsibility of the disciples and the growing Ashram to Mother. Apart from three and later four yearly “darshans,” Sri Aurobindo kept in external touch with the disciples through letters—thousands of letters in which he tirelessly dealt with their questions or difficulties or revolts.
This section consists mostly of excerpts from some of Sri Aurobindo&amp;rsquo;s letters.)

1938-1940
(In the night of November 23-24, 1938, Sri Aurobindo fell down while walking in concentration and broke his right leg. In the years that followed, a small group of disciples, mostly attendants and physicians, met him every day. Two of them recorded the informal talks that ensued, which often touched on the Indian political scene, the rising threat of Nazism, and then World War II which Sri Aurobindo followed closely.</description>

1940-1950
(This section consists of excerpts from writings, letters, and messages.)
Early 1940
 At present mankind is undergoing an evolutionary crisis in which  is concealed a choice of its destiny&amp;hellip;. Man has created a system of civilisation which has become too big for his limited mental capacity and understanding and his still more limited spiritual and moral capacity to utilise and manage, a too dangerous servant of his blundering ego and its appetites&amp;hellip;.</description>

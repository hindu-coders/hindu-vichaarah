<p>1938-1940</p>
<p>(In the night of November 23-24, 1938, Sri Aurobindo fell down while
walking in concentration and broke his right leg. In the years that
followed, a small group of disciples, mostly attendants and physicians,
met him every day. Two of them recorded the informal talks that ensued,
which often touched on the Indian political scene, the rising threat of
Nazism, and then World War II which Sri Aurobindo followed closely.</p>
<p>A few excerpts from these talks are presented here.)</p>
<p>December 23, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    Every time the Light has tried to descend it has met with
</code></pre>
<p>resistance and opposition. Christ was crucified&hellip;. Buddha was denied;
sons of Light come, the earth denies them, rejects them, and afterwards
accepts them in name to reject them in substance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>December 25, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    I have no faith in government controls, because I believe in a
</code></pre>
<p>certain amount of freedom—freedom to find out things for oneself in
one&rsquo;s own way, even freedom to commit blunders. Nature leads us through
various errors and mistakes; when Nature created the human being with
all his possibilities for good and ill she knew very well what she was
about. Freedom for experiment in human life is a great thing. Without
the freedom to take risks and commit mistakes there can be no
progress&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    \[But\] everything is moving towards mechanization in Europe.
</code></pre>
<p>The totalitarian States do not believe in any individual variation and
even non-totalitarian States are obliged to follow them; they do it for
the sake of efficiency—but whose efficiency? It is the efficiency of the
State as an organized machine, not that of the individual. The
individual has no freedom, he doesn&rsquo;t grow. Organize by all means, but
there must be scope for freedom and plasticity.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    Do you think that the average man of today is better than a
</code></pre>
<p>Greek of 2500 hundred years ago, or than an Indian of those times? Look
at the condition of Germany today [under Hitler]—you can&rsquo;t say that it
is progressing.</p>
<pre><code>    I have come in contact with the Indian masses and found them
</code></pre>
<p>better than the Europeans of the same class. They are superior to the
European working classes. The latter may be more efficient, but that is
due to external reasons&hellip;. The Irish doctor who was in our jail [at
Alipore] could not think how the young men who were so gentle and
attractive could be revolutionaries. I found even the ordinary criminal
quite human and better than his counterpart in Europe.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    It is curious how a thing gets spoiled when it gets recognition.
</code></pre>
<p>Democracy was something better when it was not called democracy. When
the name is given the truth of it seems to go out&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A disciple:) Communism began with a high ideal and it is certainly
better than Fascism or Nazism.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    In which way better? Formerly people were unconscious slaves,
</code></pre>
<p>now under Communism they are conscious slaves&hellip;. They are bound to the
State, the dictator and the party. They can&rsquo;t even choose the dictator.
And whoever differs from them is mercilessly suppressed&hellip;. The whole
thing—whatever its name—is a fraud. It is impossible to change humanity
by political machinery—it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>December 27, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    The old Indian system grew out of life, it had room for
</code></pre>
<p>everything and every interest. There were monarchy, aristocracy,
democracy; every interest was represented in the government. While in
Europe the Western system grew out of the mind: they are led by reason
and want to make everything cut and dried without any chance of freedom
or variation. If it is democracy, then democracy only—no room for
anything else. They cannot be plastic.</p>
<pre><code>    India is now trying to imitate the West. Parliamentary
</code></pre>
<p>government is not suited to India. But we always take up what the West
has thrown off&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A disciple:) What is your idea of an ideal government for India?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    My idea is like what Tagore once wrote. There may be one
</code></pre>
<p>Rashtrapati at the top with considerable powers so as to secure a
continuity of policy, and an assembly representative of the nation. The
provinces will combine into a federation united at the top, leaving
ample scope to local bodies to make laws according to their local
problems.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    The Congress at the present stage—what is it but a Fascist
</code></pre>
<p>organization? Gandhi is the dictator like Stalin, I won&rsquo;t say like
Hitler: what Gandhi says they accept and even the Working Committee
follows him; then it goes to the All-India Congress Committee which
adopts it, and then the Congress. There is no opportunity for any
difference of opinion, except for Socialists who are allowed to differ
provided they don&rsquo;t seriously differ. Whatever resolutions they pass are
obligatory on all the provinces whether the resolutions suit the
provinces or not; there is no room for any other independent opinion.
Everything is fixed up before and the people are only allowed to talk
over it—like Stalin&rsquo;s Parliament. When we started the [Nationalist]
movement we began with the idea of throwing out the Congress oligarchy
and open the whole organization to the general mass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Srinivas Iyengar retired from Congress because of his differences with
Gandhi&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    He made Charkha a religious article of faith and excluded all
</code></pre>
<p>people from Congress membership who could not spin. How many even among
his own followers believe in his gospel of Charkha? Such a tremendous
waste of energy just for the sake of a few annas is most unreasonable.</p>
<pre><code>    ...

    Give \[people\] education, technical training and give them the
</code></pre>
<p>fundamental organic principles of organization, not on political but on
business lines. But Gandhi does not want such industrial organization,
he is for going back to the old system of civilization, and so he comes
in with his magical formula “Spin, spin, spin.” C. R. Das and a few
others could act as a counterbalance. It is all a fetish.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>December 30, 1938</p>
<pre><code>    The Japanese have a wonderful power of self-control. They don't
</code></pre>
<p>lose their temper or quarrel with you, but if their honour is violated
they may kill you. They can be bitter enemies&hellip;. The Japanese also have
a high sense of chivalry&hellip;. But these things perhaps belong to the
past. It is a great pity that people who have carried such ideals into
practice are losing them through contact with European civilization.
That is a great harm that European vulgarizing has done to Japan. Now
you find most people mercantile in their outlook and they will do
anything for the sake of money&hellip;..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A disciple:) Has European civilization nothing good in it?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    It has lowered the moral tone of humanity.... The ancients tried
</code></pre>
<p>to keep to their ideals and made an effort to raise them higher, while
Europe lost all her ideals after the [first World] War. People have
become cynical, selfish, etc&hellip;. I suppose it is all due to
commercialism.</p>
<p>***</p>

<pre><code>    I am afraid it would require quite a furnace!... The trouble

<pre><code>    It is easy to see that the process of evolution is universal and

<p>The one thing that modern Europe has not taken from the Greeks is
beauty. You can&rsquo;t say modern Europe is beautiful—in fact, it is ugly.</p>
<pre><code>    What can be said of ancient Greece can be said also of ancient
</code></pre>
<p>India. She had beauty, much of which she has since lost. The Japanese
are the only race that can be said to have preserved beauty in their
life. But now even they are fast losing it under European influence.</p>
<pre><code>    The setback to the human mind in Europe is amazing.... We had

<p>thought during the last years of the nineteenth century that the human
mind had attained a certain level of intelligence and that it would have
to be satisfied before any new idea could find acceptance. But it seems
one can&rsquo;t rely on common sense to stand the strain. We find Nazi ideas
being accepted; fifty years back it would have been impossible to
predict their acceptance. Then, again, the ease with which the best
intellectuals accept psychoanalysis and Freud&rsquo;s ideas is surprising.</p>

<pre><code>    I am afraid Gandhi has been trying to apply to ordinary life

<p>what belongs to spirituality. Non-violence or ahimsa as a spiritual
attitude and its practice is perfectly understandable and has a standing
of its own. You may not accept it in toto but it has a basis in reality.
You can live it in spiritual life, but to apply it to all life is
absurd&hellip;. It is a principle which can be applied with success if
practised on a mass scale, specially by unarmed people like the Indians,
because you are left with no other choice. But even when it succeeds it
is not that you have changed the heart of the enemy, but that you have
made it impossible for him to rule&hellip;.</p>

produce.</p>
<pre><code>    In India we had a kind of communism in the villages. The whole

practicable. Each such commune can be independent and many such units
can be scattered all over the country and they can combine or coordinate
their activities for a common purpose.</p>

parliamentary system with local bodies—the municipal councils—is not
workable: these councils have no living contact with the people; the
councillors make only platform speeches and nobody knows what they do

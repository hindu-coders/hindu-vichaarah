<p>III</p>
<p>1923-1926</p>
<p>(In these years, Sri Aurobindo used to have daily talks with a few
disciples on a wide variety of subjects, from his yoga to the prevailing
national or international situation. The following excerpts from these
talks, noted down from memory by some of the disciples present, provide
glimpses of Sri Aurobindo&rsquo;s views on India&rsquo;s political, social, cultural
systems and her spiritual possibilities.)</p>
<p>April 9, 1923</p>
<pre><code>    The ancients \[in India\] based their society on the structure
</code></pre>
<p>of religion—I do not mean narrow religion but the highest law of our
being. The whole social fabric was built up to fulfil that purpose.
There was no talk in those days of individual liberty in the present
sense of the term, but there was absolute communal liberty. Every
community was completely free to develop its own religion,—the law of
its being. Even the selection of the line was a matter of free choice
for the individual&hellip;. In ancient times each community had its own
Dharma and within itself it was independent; every village, every city
had its own organization quite free from all political control and
within that every individual was free—free to change and take up another
line for his development. But all this was not put into a definite
political unit. There were, of course, attempts at that kind of
expression of life but they were only partially successful. The whole
community in India was a very big one and the community culture based on
Dharma was not thrown into a kind of [political or national]
organization which would resist external aggression.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>April 18, 1923</p>
<p>(The short-lived display of Hindu-Muslim unity that followed the launch
of the Khilafat agitation in 1920 soon gave way to renewed distrust and
acrimony, which seized on issues such as Hindu processions playing music
before mosques, killing of cows in public during Id, etc.; early in 1923
clashes broke out in Amritsar and Multan, now in Pakistan, and were
going to recur with increasing frequency till the Partition—and after.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A disciple:) Did you read [Pandit Madan Mohan] Malaviya&rsquo;s speech
about the Multan riots and also what C. Rajagopalachari has said?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<pre><code>   (Sri Aurobindo:)* I am sorry they are making a fetish of this
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hindu-Muslim unity. It is no use ignoring facts; some day the Hindus may
have to fight the Muslims and they must prepare for it. Hindu-Muslim
unity should not mean the subjection of the Hindus. Every time the
mildness of the Hindu has given way. The best solution would be to allow
the Hindus to organize themselves and the Hindu-Muslim unity would take
care of itself, it would automatically solve the problem. Otherwise, we
are lulled into a false sense of satisfaction that we have solved a
difficult problem, when in fact we have only shelved it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>July 23, 1923</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A disciple:) The Mahatma believes that non-violence purifies the man
who practises it.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    I believe Gandhi does not know what actually happens to the
</code></pre>
<p>man&rsquo;s nature when he takes to Satyagraha or non-violence. He thinks that
men get purified by it. But when men suffer, or subject themselves to
voluntary suffering, what happens is that their vital being gets
strengthened. These movements affect the vital being only and not any
other part. Now, when you cannot oppose the force that oppresses, you
say that you will suffer. That suffering is vital and it gives strength.
When the man who has thus suffered gets power he becomes a worse
oppressor&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    What one *can* do is to transform the spirit of violence. But in
</code></pre>
<p>this practice of Satyagraha it is not transformed. When you insist on
such a one-sided principle, what happens is that cant, hypocrisy and
dishonesty get in and there is no purification at all. Purification can
come by the transformation of the impulse of violence, as I said. In
that respect the old system in India was much better: the man who had
the fighting spirit became the Kshatriya and then the fighting spirit
was raised above the ordinary vital influence. The attempt was to
spiritualize it. It succeeded in doing what passive resistance cannot
and will not achieve. The Kshatriya was the man who would not allow any
oppression, who would fight it out and he was the man who would not
oppress anybody. That was the ideal&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also the question of Hindu-Muslim unity which the
non-violence school is trying to solve on the basis of their theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    You can live amicably with a religion whose principle is
</code></pre>
<p>toleration. But how is it possible to live peacefully with a religion
whose principle is “I will not tolerate you”? How are you going to have
unity with these people? Certainly, Hindu-Muslim unity cannot be arrived
at on the basis that the Muslims will go on converting Hindus while the
Hindus shall not convert any Mahomedan. You can’t build unity on such a
basis. Perhaps the only way of making the Mahomedans harmless is to make
them lose their fanatic faith in their religion&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mahomedan religion was born under such circumstances that the
followers never forgot the origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    That was the result of the passive resistance which they
</code></pre>
<p>practised. They went on suffering till they got strong enough and, when
they got power, they began to persecute others with a vengeance&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandhi&rsquo;s position is that he does not care to remove violence from
others; he wants to observe non-violence himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    That is one of the violences of the Satyagrahi that he does not
</code></pre>
<p>care for the presssure which he brings on others. It is not
non-violence—it is not “Ahimsa.” True Ahimsa is a state of mind and does
not consist in physical or external action or in avoidance of action.
Any pressure in the inner being is a breach of Ahimsa.</p>
<pre><code>    For instance, when Gandhi fasted in the Ahmedabad mill-hands'
</code></pre>
<p>strike to settle the question between mill-owners and workers, there was
a kind of violence towards others. The mill-owners did not want to be
responsible for his death and so they gave way, without, of course,
being convinced of his position. It is a kind of violence on them. But

<pre><code>    The Mahomedan or Islamic culture hardly gave anything to the

<p>world which may be said to be of fundamental importance and typically
its own; Islamic culture was mainly borrowed from others. Their
mathematics and astronomy and other subjects were derived from India and
Greece. It is true they gave some of these things a new turn, but they
have not created much. Their philosophy and their religion are very
simple and what they call Sufism is largely the result of gnostics who
lived in Persia and it is the logical outcome of that school of thought
largely touched by Vedanta.</p>
<pre><code>    I have, however, mentioned \[in *The Foundations of Indian

<p>Culture*] that Islamic culture contributed the Indo-Saracenic
architecture to Indian culture. I do not think it has done anything more
in India of cultural value. It gave some new forms to art and poetry.
Its political institutions were always semi-barbaric.</p>

That is the difference between a man who lives and a thinker who can&rsquo;t:
a leader who thinks too much and is busy with ideas, trying all the time
to fit the realities of life to his ideas, hardly succeeds, while the
leader who is destined to succeed does not bother his head about ideas.
He sees the forces at work and knows by intuition those that make for
success. He also knows the right combination of forces and the right
moment when he should act&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    Look at Indian politicians: all ideas, ideas—they are busy with
</code></pre>
<p>ideas. Take the Hindu-Muslim problem: I don&rsquo;t know why our politicians
accepted Gandhi&rsquo;s Khilafat agitation.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> With the mentality
of the ordinary Mahomedan it was bound to produce the reaction it has
produced: you fed the force, it gathered power and began to make demands
which the Hindu mentality had to rise up and reject. That does not
require Supermind to find out, it requires common sense. Then, the
Mahomedan reality and the Hindu reality began to break heads at
Calcutta.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> The leaders are busy trying to square the
realities with their mental ideas instead of facing them straight&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    At one time it was thought that the mind could grasp the whole

full play and we find that it is not able to solve the problems. Now, we
find that it is possible to go beyond mind and there is the Supermind
which is the organization of the Infinite Consciousness. There you find
the truth of all that is in mind and life.</p>
<pre><code>    For instance, you find that Democracy, Socialism and Communism

<p>have each some truth behind it, but it is not the whole Truth. What you
have to do is to find out the forces that are at work and understand
what it is of which all these mental ideas and “isms” are a mere
indication. You have to know the mistakes which people commit in dealing
with the truth of these forces and the truth that is behind the mistakes
also. I am, at present, speaking against democracy; that does not mean
that there is no truth behind it. I know the truth [behind democracy],
but I speak against democracy because that mentality is at present
against the Truth that is trying to come down.</p>

European—truly, a Russian Christian in an Indian body. And there are
some Indians in European bodies?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandhi a European?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    Yes. When the Europeans say that he is more Christian than many
</code></pre>
<p>Christians (some even say that he is “Christ of the modern times”) they
are perfectly right. All his preaching is derived from Christianity, and
though the garb is Indian the essential spirit is Christian. He may not
be Christ, but at any rate he comes in continuation of the same
impulsion. He is largely influenced by Tolstoy, the Bible, and has a
strong Jain tinge in his teachings; at any rate more than by the Indian
scriptures—the Upanishads or the Gita which he interprets in the light
of his own ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many educated Indians consider him a spiritual man.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    Yes, because the Europeans call him spiritual. But what he
</code></pre>
<p>preaches is not Indian spirituality but something derived from Russian
Christianity, non-violence, suffering, etc. &hellip;</p>
<pre><code>    The Russians are a queer mixture of strength and weakness. They
</code></pre>
<p>have got a passion in their intellect, say, a passionate intellect. They
have a distracted and restless emotional being, but there is something
behind it which is very fine and psychic, though their soul is not very
healthy. And therefore I am not right in saying that Gandhi is a Russian
Christian, because he is so very dry. He has got the intellectual
passion and a great moral will-force, but he is more dry than the
Russians. The gospel of suffering that he is preaching has its root in
Russia as nowhere else in Europe—other Christian nations don&rsquo;t believe
in it. At the most they have it in the mind, but the Russians have got
it in their very blood. They commit a mistake in preaching the gospel of
suffering, but we also commit in India a mistake in preaching the idea
of <em>vairagya</em> [disgust with the world].</p>

both.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>June 29, 1926</p>
<pre><code>    In India we had nothing of the mental ideal in politics. We had
</code></pre>
<p>a spontaneous and a free growth of communities developing on their own
lines. It was not so much a mental idea as an inner impulse or feeling,
to express life in a particular form. Each such communal form of
life—the village, the town, etc., which formed the unit of national
life, was left free in its own internal management. The central
authority never interfered with it.</p>
<pre><code>    There was not the idea of “interest” in India as in Europe,
</code></pre>
<p>i.e., each community was not fighting for its own interest; but there
was the idea of Dharma, the function which the individual and the
community has to fulfil in the larger national life. There were caste
organizations not based upon a religio-social basis as we find nowadays;
they were more or less guilds, groups organized for a communal life.
There were also religious communities like the Buddhists, the Jains,
etc. Each followed its own law—Swadharma—unhampered by the State. The
State recognized the necessity of allowing such various forms of life to
develop freely in order to give to the national spirit a richer
expression.</p>
<pre><code>    Then over the two there was the central authority, whose
</code></pre>
<p>function was not so much to legislate as to harmonize and see that
everything was going on all right. It was generally administered by a
Raja; in cases it was also an elected head of the clan, as in the
instance of Gautama Buddha&rsquo;s father. Each ruled over either a small
State or a group of small States or republics. The king was not a
law-maker and he was not at the head to put his hand over all
organizations and keep them down. If he interfered with them he was
deposed because each of these organizations had its own laws which had
been established for long ages.</p>
<pre><code>    The machinery of the State also was not so mechanical as in the
</code></pre>
<p>West—it was plastic and elastic.</p>
<pre><code>    This organization we find in history perfected in the reign of
</code></pre>
<p>Chandragupta and the Maurya dynasty. The period preceding this must have
been a period of great political development in India. Every department
of national life, we can see, was in the charge of a board or a
committee with a minister at the head, and each board looked after what
we now would call its own department and was left free from undue
interference of the central authority. The change of kings left these
boards untouched and unaffected in their work. An organization similar
to that was found in every town and village and it was this organization
that was taken up by the Mahomedans when they came to India. It is that
which the English also have taken up. The idea of the King as the
absolute monarch was never an Indian idea. It was brought from Central
Asia by the Mahomedans.</p>
<pre><code>    The English in accepting this system have disfigured it
</code></pre>
<p>considerably. They have found ways to put their hand on and grasp all
the old organizations, using them merely as channels to establish more
thoroughly the authority of the central power. They discouraged every
free organization and every attempt at the manifestation of the free
life of the community. Now attempts are being made to have the
cooperative societies in villages, there is an effort at reviving the
Panchayats. But these organizations cannot be revived once they have
been crushed; and even if they revived they would not be the same.</p>
<pre><code>    If the old organization had lasted it would have been a
</code></pre>
<p>successful rival of the modern form of government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to come back to old forms in modern times?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    You need not come back to the old forms, but you *can* retain
</code></pre>
<p>the spirit which might create its own new forms&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    It has been a special feature of India that she has to contain
</code></pre>
<p>in her life all the most diverse elements and assimilate them. This
renders her problem most intricate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is India&rsquo;s destiny to assimilate all the conflicting elements,
is it possible to assimilate the Mahomedan element also?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    Why not? India has assimilated elements from the Greeks, the
</code></pre>
<p>Persians and other nations. But she assimilates only when her central
truth is recognized by the other party, and even while assimilating she
does it in such a way that the elements absorbed are no longer
recognizable as foreign but become part of herself. For instance, we
took from the Greek architecture, from the Persian painting, etc.</p>
<pre><code>    The assimilation of the Mahomedan culture also was done in the
</code></pre>
<p>mind to a great extent and it would have perhaps gone further. But in
order that the process may be complete it is necessary that a change in
the Mahomedan mentality should come. The conflict is in the outer life
and unless the Mahomedans learn tolerance I do not think the
assimilation is possible.</p>
<pre><code>    The Hindu is ready to tolerate. He is open to new ideas and his
</code></pre>
<p>culture has got a wonderful capacity for assimilation, but always
provided that India&rsquo;s central truth is recognized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did India have the national idea in the modern sense?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    The “nation idea” India never had. By that I mean the political

<p>idea of the nation. It is a modern growth. But we <em>had</em> in India the
cultural and spiritual idea of the nation&hellip;.</p>
<pre><code>    Present-day Indians have got nothing to boast of from their
</code></pre>
<p>past. Indian culture today is in the most abject condition, like the
fort of Gingee—one pillar standing here, another ceiling there and some
hall out of recognition somewhere?</p>

since degenerated. Those forms have now been taken up and distorted.

an atmosphere—a pervasive atmosphere of learning. The students should
imbibe that, find out their own aptitudes and develop along those
lines&hellip;. Under the proper system of education both the needs—the need

impossible not to sympathise with this attitude&hellip;. I would gladly ask
for postponement of Swaraj activity if thereby we could advance the
interest of the Khilafat.”⁹¹</p>

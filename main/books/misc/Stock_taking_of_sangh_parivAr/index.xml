      <description>Introduction
The credit for the present compilation goes wholly to Dr. Shreerang Godbole. It was his letters written to us in August-September 1996 which prompted us to circulate in October 1996 an 8-page brochure - Time For Stock Taking: A Swayamsevak Speaks - which we reproduce below:
 Dr. Shreerang Godbole is a young medical practitioner at Pune in Maharashtra. He has been a swayamsevak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for seventeen years.</description>

      <description>1. A Call for an Intellectual
(Bauddhika) Kshatriya
DAVID FRAWLEY
We live in the age of the information revolution, which has taken a quantum leap since the introduction of computers. The information flood is changing the nature of the society in which we live, in ways that we do not yet know and for which there is no precedent. This information revolution is in many respects an information war, with different groups struggling to put their views out to the general public as the truth.</description>

      <description>2. Ideological Defence of Hindu Society
SITA RAM GOEL
1. Ideological aggression, if not resisted in proper time, leads invariably to physical aggression.
2. Instead of promoting a physical clash, ideological defence
 i. prevents it most of the time because the aggressor stands warned that he would be resisted;
ii. or minimises one-sided violence because the victim also stands well-prepared;
iii. and often helps the aggressor to drop his habit because he comes to know that the other side knows his designs or that there is another side of the story.</description>

      <description>1. G.V. Ashtekar
 At the outset, I must acknowledge the truth in the objections raised by Dr. Shreerang Godbole. I also take this opportunity of expressing my deep respect and reverence about the work done by Voice of India for awakening Hindu scholars for the new outlook as well as for presenting them with the perceptions and facets of Hindutva which had remained elusive for centuries.
I firmly believe that the leadership of the RSS which has consented to this new step, do know these facts very well.</description>

      <description>2. Professor G.C. Asnani
 1. I broadly agree with the stand taken by Dr. Shreerang Godbole.
2. In a labour organisation concerned with purely economic problem, why bring religion - Sarva Dharma, etc.?
3. We were five student friends studying in Karachi College in the beginning of 1940’s. One of us started taking interest in the RSS. The rest of us vehemently opposed him, calling him communalist; we were nationalists, secularists, congressites.</description>

      <description>3. Deep Chandra Awasthi
 At the very outset I would like to say that the eight formulations popularised by Sangh Parivar in recent years as stated, is not the whole fact. There may be even some more such formulations put forth by individuals as social hypothesis yet to be put to tests before being accepted as useful practices. The most that can be said is that the Sangh Parivar may also be in a mood to carry out some such tests.</description>

 I have gone through both the letters written by a Pune Swayamsevak for the RSS organisation. The issue pointed out in the letters is quite genuine and crucial, particularly after the formation of Pakistan and Bangla Desh. We had the same Constitution before also, but partition could not be prevented in spite of the sacrifice of Mahatma Gandhi - showering liberties on a people bent on separation.</description>

      <description>5. S. K. Balasubramanian
 You have performed a service by circulating the note of Dr. Shreerang Godbole. The note raises pertinent questions about the usefulness of the movement for equality amongst religions as. presently conceived by the RSS leadership. His observations are also relevant at the international level.
People who ask Hindus to treat all religions equally are barking up the wrong tree. Pluralism in faith is part of the baggage that every Hindu carries from cradle to grave.</description>

      <description>6. Abhas Chatterjee
 In the hierarchy of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha, Dr. Shreerang Godbole is only a Swayamsevak. One wishes he was the Sarsanghchãlak or the Sarkaryavãh. For, the ideological clarity, historical perception, understanding of national issues and intellectual awareness that he has exhibited in his two short write-ups, have been so sadly lacking in the top-brass of the organisation.
The RSS was started by its illustrious founder Dr. K.</description>

 Dr. Shreerang Godbole has actually given vent to his deep anguish which is gnawing at the heart and mind of the Hindu intelligentsia today. He has spoken THE TRUTH - may it be bitter.
I am writing these lines not only from my knowledge but from my experience and from what I have seen, and the events of recent past which I have lived and borne.</description>

 I received a pamphlet from you entitled “Time for Stock Taking”.
Since 1930 I have been a devotee of Hindutva, having been in association with the people who at that time used to be called ‘Savarkarites’ at Ratnagiri.
Although I did not/do not possess the qualities of a leader, writer or an orator, since then I have contributed to the cause of Hindutva according to my capacity, even at the cost of being teased sarcastically as a Votary.</description>

      <description>9. Ashoke Dasgupta
 I am in receipt of the booklet detailing two documents of Dr. Shreerang Godbole. I am grateful for the same. My response on these two documents is as under:
It is evident that ‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’ is launched because a new avenue is being sought in order to frame a policy in respect of the Muslim question in the Indian polity.
It is rather an approach - an approach to be in touch of the Muslim community so that the political untouchability towards BJP propagated by the Secularists can be overcome.</description>

 FIRST DOCUMENT:
1. What is the harm in adding Jesus and Muhammad to the 33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses?
Response: What is the need? Why do we want to add two more gods to 33 crore gods and goddesses? Is this a genuine desire to assimilate two communities following two Semitic religions?
In my opinion, the Sangh leadership is guided by BJP leadership, which in turn is guided by desire to achieve political supremacy at any cost, and this desire (of political power at any cost) has brought down the BJP leadership to the lowly depths of electoral arithmetic - votes count, votes of Christians and Muslims also count.</description>

 Received your “Time for Stock Taking”. Each and every word of this pamphlet especially from Dr. Godbole spoke my heart and mind. I bow down before you and Godbole for such an unbeatable logic.
Hindu intellectuals should expose Quran and Hadith i.e. Islam. Islam in itself is very very weak and fragile without any reason and philosophy. It is medieval and unscientific. So it will not at all stand the test of time.</description>

      <description>**12. Adwayanand R. Galatge **
 Dr. Shreerang Godbole, an RSS worker from Pune, has done some plain speaking to the Sangh leaders on the question of Muslims. It is tragic to find that they really deserve it. It is a measure of the level to which the RSS has been reduced by its leaders’ recent preoccupation with politics. The sordid drama recently enacted on the Gujarat stage exposes the hazards of politics to which RSS is open and can ill-afford.</description>

 I have your request for response to the circular titled ‘Time for Stock Taking’ and here is my response for the first document given item-wise in order to keep it to the minimum.
 1. It may be possible in the next 100 years or so to add Jesus Christ as one of the many Gods (33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses) as Jesus is a Godhead for Christians and Christians have no objection for portraying Jesus and his disciples in the form of idols and pictures just as Hindus have added Buddha as one of the Avataras.</description>

 I am grateful to you for sending me a copy of “Time for Stock Taking” by Dr. S. Godbole.
I fully agree with his contentions.
Hindus, throughout the ages, especially our so-called ‘MAHATMAS’, never understood the Muslim mind and fell an easy prey to Muslim manipulations. Hindus were always on the defensive for no reason at all, (see my enclosed letter to Organiser weekly, Delhi, dated 2.</description>

      <description>15. Bhagwati Prasad Goenka
 I am thankful to you for a copy of ‘Time for Stock Taking’ booklet.
Religions are made for people to shape their lives, in short, to establish a code of conduct for themselves. A religion which preaches that other religions are inferior, cannot be equated with a religion which preaches that all are equal and that all can attain salvation whatever way they adopt. For this matter the comparing of Islam or Christianity with Hinduism is not only impractical but totally naive.</description>

 I have received your pamphlet “Time for Stock Taking”, and gone through it in detail.
Your first document mentions the attitude of Hindu organizations towards the Muslims problem.
Only Hindus who are unware of the Vedas, say that there is no harm in adding Jesus and Mohammed to the 33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses. It is an indication of the slave mentality of Hindus. Christianity and Islam are Semitic religions.</description>

There is a Hindu resurgence but not to the extent it should be.
It is also true that in spite of Hindu resurgence, the Hindu organisations are becoming softer towards Islam and Muslims.</description>

 I have received the circular ‘Time For Stock Taking’. You have desired that the intelligentsia, particularly the Hindu intelligentsia, should offer their opinion about the ideology of Islam and how do they react to the same.
I am liberally educated, having an open mind, and have no prejudices or preconceived thoughts about any religion, much less against Christianity or Islam.
In my opinion Hinduism or Sanatan Dharma has a long history of toleration.</description>

 General
It is a tragedy that the 3 different wings, namely, the BJP which is a political institution for establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra, the RSS which is an organisational wing of BJP, and the VHP which is a religious platform for Hindus, are not able to work in unison for a common cause - establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra, which is the need of the hour to prevent threats of Muslim rule, either direct on by proxy in the name of secular, democratic Bharat.</description>

      <description>20. Dr. S.D. Kulkarni
 Semitic Faiths are Political Creeds, not Religions
Since its inception, Islam is being practised as a political creed. It is not a religion. These two terms creed and religion are poles apart. Creed is a dogmatic belief system as propounded by a person who claims himself to be a prophet like the Jewish prophet Moses or the Islamic prophet Muhammad, or a super-intelligent person, or a thinker like Marx, next only to God.</description>

 First Document
With reference to Dr. Godbole’s analysis of the eight conceptions of the so-called Hindu Organizations regarding the Muslim Problem, his first two responsive comments reiterate the fact that Cults of Uniformism masquerading as religions are bound to be imperialist aggressors.
Regarding the third conception – ‘Islam is good but Muslims are bad’ - Dr Godbole has rightly reiterated that the difficulty resides in the Cult that is fundamental to the group consciousness of the Muslims.</description>

 Dr. S. Godbole’s comments at a Seminar in Pune and his letter to Shri K.S. Sudarshan, published by the Voice of India in the form of a brochure titled Time for Stock Taking, raise issues of vital importance to the Majority population of Hindus in the country. There are many minority groups in India. But except the Muslims, they pose no serious problem. The Muslim position has been intractable both before and after Partition.</description>

 No organization has so far found any solution to merge the Muslims in India with Hindu society. National Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Janata Dal and such parties have only succeeded in increasing the rift between the two creeds and making Muslims more stubborn. Muslims are like an idiotic son of negligent parents. Careful attention only can correct him. Muslim as an individual is quite accommodative like other human beings.</description>

 Before going into the questions raised by Dr. Godbole, let us understand the stage where we stand and discuss.
In today’s Bharath, a Hindu is a Hindu because his father is a Hindu. So is the case with a Muslim or a Christian. Generally, nobody knows or even bothers to know the guiding principles of one’s own faith, leave alone understanding someone else’s faith. Hindus go to temples, perform some rituals (of which they do not have any understanding) and claim to be devout Hindus.</description>

 I entirely agree with Dr. Shreerang Godbole’s view on the likelihood of confusion being created by the leaders of the Sangh Parivar, owing to its contradictory stances on its approach towards the Muslim problem. The Mantra of “Sarvadharmasamabhãva” has clogged the mind of Hindu leaders for too long. Firstly, how many of these leaders who have interiorized this concept can claim to be aware of the tenets of Christianity and Islam which have time and again wreaked havoc on Hindu Society?</description>

 Thanks for mailing the small but thought provoking pamphlet “TIME FOR STOCK TAKING”. I very much appreciate your gesture of inviting the responses from the Hindu Mind.
1. The Indian National Congress from the very inception was not for the welfare of Hindusthan and its citizens, especially the Hindus and their culture, but for the unhindered continuation of the British rule. Pseudo-Nationalist leaders steeped in Western culture took over and gave the call of Nationalism, which was taken up by the common man and became a mass frenzied Nationalism, an outcome of the Westernised Indian leaders.</description>

 I refer to the document “Time For Stock Taking”. I am surprised that the Sangh Parivar has been popularizing these eight slogans. Obviously, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar have not read either the Bible or the Quran. If they had read them, they would not be making such ridiculous statements. With friends like these, Hindus do not need enemies.

 Dr. Shreerang Godbole has issued a timely warning against cosy soporific slogans currently mouthed by leaders of some prominent Hindu organisations. His documents display a clarity of mind and courage of conviction that is rare among Hindu intellectuals.
While one agrees entirely with the tone and tenor of the documents, some of Dr. Godbole’s formulations need improvement. It is sufficient to say that the openness of Hinduism should not be misused to sanction those dogmas of other religious groups which breed exclusiveness, intolerance and aggressiveness.</description>

 I am replying to the issues raised by your brochure.
1. The doctrine of Islam is Unity. The Koran say that Allah is one and alone, without a second. In Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God, which means he is second to God. Thus other men cannot be sons of God and will go to Heaven or Hell for ever, not according to their actions but on the recommendations of Jesus.</description>

 We cannot be sufficiently grateful to Dr. Godbole for having questioned the validity of a thesis advanced by the BJP think-tank and its allied organisations with a view to creating a constituency among the Indian Muslims who form barely 12% of the total population of India. The BJP brains trust has devised an agenda of which the eight formulations pointed out by Dr. Godbole form the core.</description>

 Thanks for sending the booklet ‘Time for Stock Taking’. I have noted that the author has shown his utmost concern regarding the ‘Hindu-Muslim’ problem nagging the country even after partition in a new form, i.e., Secularism vs. Communalism, and the Congress policy of appeasement of Muslims going on merrily as before with help of its allies (Communists, Casteists and Communalists) to the detriment of the Majority community.</description>

 After Kumbhakarna had practised severe austerities, Brahmã appeared before him and said, “I am pleased with your tapasyã, what boon would you have?”
“God, give me plenty of sleep: good, long sleep, for I enjoy it most!” replied Kumbhakarna.
“So be it,” blessed Brahmã and disappeared.
And thereafter, goes the story, Kumbhakarna used to sleep for six months at a stretch, wake up for a day to eat and drink, and go back to sleep for another six months.</description>

 First Document:
 1. Muhammad is Allah’s messenger, and a mortal human being. Hence he is only an intermediary, which is also the claim made by his votaries. Some sentimental Hindus may have no objection to count him as a saint. But there is no question of his being included in the category of Hindu Gods.
Jesus is considered as the Son of God. But according to Christian belief, he presented himself as a martyr for the sake of humanity.</description>

 I am reacting only to one of the points raised in Dr. Godbole’s Second Document, namely, the similarity between Christianity, Islam and Marxism as distinguished from true religions.
David Frawley in his book, Hinduism; The Eternal Tradition, says that “the attempt to connect human being with the Eternal is the very essence of true religion”. He further elucidates that true religions base themselves upon something Universal and function harmoniously with the World and Nature.</description>

 Islam -The Unknown
For years, Mahatma Gandhi made his congregation recite with devotional spirit: “Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram… Ishwar Allah tere naam, Sabko sanmati de Bhagwaan”.
Hindus of all hues were carried away by these chantings, and even after about half a century of his demise, or so to say, bloody partition of the country, this hymn is heard on AIR, DD and through loudspeakers on 2nd October and 31st January from year to year.</description>

 This is with reference to the pamphlet “Time For Stock Taking: A Swayamsevak Speaks” published by Voice of India.

 Dr. Shreerang Godbole, a Swayamsewak of the RSS for 17 years, put forth his views frankly and plainly on “Hindu Organisations and the Muslim Problem” at a Seminar in the presence of the think-tanks of the Sangh Parivar. Immediately after that, he wrote a letter to Shri K.S. Sudarshan, Sah-Karyawaha R.S.S., bemoaning the formation of the “Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch” by the Sangh.
Thanks to Voice of India both the documents are now available to the interested persons.</description>

 I quite agree with what Dr. Godbole has opined about Islam and Christianity and the concept of Secularism or Sarvadharma Sambhãv or Sarva Panth Samãdar etc.
Yes, it is utterly wrong to bracket Hinduism (and its offshoots like Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism) with such exclusivist ideologies as Islam and Christianity. It is in fact wrong to regard Christianity and Islam as Dharmas. Let us discuss why.</description>

 Dr. Godbole’s views are stated so succinctly, so concisely and so comprehensively that there is really little need for any comments on them: it is for the Sangh leadership to read his views very carefully and repeatedly, and to seriously ponder over the matter.
However, I would like, nevertheless, to make the following elaborations of my views on the following points raised by Dr. Godbole as well as by Voice of India in their comments on his views:</description>

We Hindus find it deeply distressing that quite a few Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders of national stature have taken to propagating among the Hindu public certain proposition to propitiate the Muslims. These propositions, besides being false and misleading, are highly dangerous to Hindu society as they implant Negationism - the denial of the centuries-long Muslim havoc in India - in the Hindu mind.</description>

 I am highly grateful to you for sending to me the views of Dr. Godbole on the recent efforts of some Hindu organisations at bringing Muslims into Indian mainstream by preaching equal respect for every religion. But the exercise is futile and will only weaken the structure of the nation.
Instead, we must give serious thought to the ailments which are bedevilling the nation. Why even after so much accommodation of almost every demand, reasonable or unreasonable, Muslims make a show of disaffection and dissatisfaction?</description>

 1. Yes, we would not mind including Jesus and Muhammad to the list of 33 crore Gods if they include one of our Gods to their’s. Tolerance cannot be a one-sided affair. Why do we have to do that in the first place? Let them live their religion, whatever that is, and let us live ours.

 It was indeed very nice of you to give me an opportunity to express my views on the important points raised by Dr. Godbole of Pune.
Alas! every word of Dr. Godbole is true. This truth has been brought out clearly in many documented publications on Christianity and Islam.
“Sarva Dharma Samabãhva”
People, who think on these lines commit the blunder of believing that Islam is only Namaz, Roza, Zakat and Hajj which are of course common to all religions in one form or the other.</description>

 I. Dipen Banerjee
At first I must thank you, for sending such a valuable document written by Dr. Shreerang Godbole to a man like me of no importance.
Now I like to say something as a Hindu in general. Though I am not a Swayamsevak, I am closely related with the R.S.S. So I feel sad when I see that even a Nationalistic organisation like B.M.S. fails to understand the basic ideologies of the monotheistic traditions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism, and harps on the much vaunted theory of Sarva Pantha Samãdar.</description>

      <description>1. Sarva Dharma Samabhãva
or Sarva Dharma Sambhrama?
(Unity or Confusion of Religions?)
David Frawley
 A common tenet of Hinduism is “Sarva Dharma Samabhãva,” which literally means that all Dharmas are equal to or harmonious with each other. In recent times this statement has been highlighted as meaning that “all religions are the same” - that all religions are merely different paths to God or the same spiritual goal. Based on this logic the religious path that one takes is a matter of personal preference, like choosing whether to eat rice or chapatis in order to fill one’s stomach.</description>

      <description>1. Roll Over, Rushdie
Daniel Pipes
 In March 1989, shortly after Ayatollah Khomeini issued his decree sentencing Salman Rushdie to death for his novel The Satanic Verses, London’s Observer newspaper published an anonymous letter from Pakistan. “Salman Rushdie speaks for me,” wrote its author, who explained: “Mine is a voice that has not yet found expression in newspaper columns. It is the voice of those who are born Muslims but wish to recant in adulthood, yet are not permitted to on pain of death.</description>

G.A. Wells
 Why I Am Not a Muslim, By Ibn Warraq (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1995) 402 pp., $25.95 cloth.
Why I Am Not a Muslim certainly deserves the epithet “courageous” with which R. J. Hoffmann introduces it in his Foreword, not so much because of its thesis that Islamic civilization often reached magnificent heights despite the religion of Islam, as because almost all the fundamental tents of Islam are here scrutinized uncompromisingly.</description>

      <description>4. Islam is religious fascism
Ibn AI-Rawandi
  Why I am not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq
(Prometheus Books, £15 to RPA members).
 In one of his early works the traditionalist writer Frithjof Schuon makes an acute observation about the mentality of Muslims: ‘The intellectual - and thereby the rational - foundation of Islam results in the average Muslim having a curious tendency to believe that non-Muslims either know that Islam is the truth and reject it out of pure obstinacy, or else are simply ignorant of it and can be converted by elementary explanations; that anyone should be able to oppose Islam with a good conscience quite exceeds the Muslim’s power of imagination, precisely because Islam coincides in his mind with the irresistible logic of things.</description>

Dr. Jan Knappert
 Ibn Warraq : Why I am not a Muslim, Prometheus Books, New York 1995, xvi, 402 pages, ISBN: 0-87975-984-4.
Ibn Warraq grew up in a Muslim family. Islam is a jealous religion so that any man who grew up in a Muslim family and is, for that reason considered a Muslim, not by his own volition, has to remain a Muslim for life, or else he is sentenced to death, and this sentence will be carried out as soon as a Muslim assassin can get him in the crossed hairs.</description>

1. Legacy of hate
Hindus and Muslims must endeavour
to undo partition
By K. R. Malkani
 The Hindu-Muslim problem is a fact of Indian life. This problem is a legacy of the past, particularly that of the recent past, when the British gave it a new and dangerous twist, resulting in the partition of India. And it is a problem that sours relations, distorts the whole Indian polity and acts as a drag on the country.</description>

 KISHANGANJ, March 1 - The BJP is wooing the electorate in this Muslim-dominated district, 18 km from the Indo-Bangladesh border, by inviting Bangladeshis to enter “not in a clandestine manner but through the front door”.
The change in the BJP’s rigid stand on “infiltration” has given the party a foothold in Thakurganj, Bahadurganj and Kishanganj constituencies, which go to the polls shortly.</description>

Fashioning an ambivalent strategy ahead of the next year’s general elections, the BJP after its Panaji session, has sought to don a “minority-friendly” image, while insisting that its “basic image will stay intact”.</description>

 BOMBAY, April 28.
Some leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra have proposed that the floor space index (FSI) for mosques in Bombay be increased to accommodate a larger number of people offering namaaz (prayers). This would also help end offering of prayers on the roads outside mosques.*
The offering of namaaz on roads had caused considerable tension in Bombay two years ago with the Shiv Sena and the BJP voicing strong protests and organising maha artis on the roads.</description>

Addressing the first state convention of the newly-formed minority front of the BJP, former national president of the party Murli Manohar Joshi urged Muslims to take a “fresh look” at the BJP, if they wished to escape from the clutches of the Congress, which he alleged had been “exploiting them over the past several decades”.</description>

The RSS functionaries, sources say, are now meeting Muslim leaders to ‘get itself rid of the fascist tag’ - just last week the top brass led by deputy general secretary K.</description>

20. Babri or “Barabari”?
Sudheendra Kulkarni on Muslims’ choice
 Two Prime Ministers, one present and the other his immediate predecessor, have last week made statements about Indian Muslims which, despite the sharp differences in their political ideologies, reveal a remarkable commonality of observation. H.D. Deve Gowda, in an interview given to a major Hindi daily, has stated that “the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in some parts of the country are worse than those of Dalits.</description>

22. J.K. Hindu exiles eulogise Thackeray
BY SUJATA ANANDAN
 MUMBAI, Sept. 24: As the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attempts to shrug off the Shiv Sena, which in recent days has become an albatross round its neck, it might find that it is losing ground to its ally where matters relating to the Hindu heart are concerned.
The BJP’s dilly-dallying over hardcore Hindutva issues has already earned it the ridicule of the extreme right of the Hindu fundamentalist forces.</description>

23. Secularism is the very colour
of our blood: Vajpayee
Pankaj Sharma
 JAIPUR: BJP’s imminent strategy is going to be crystal clear now. Days to come would give the BJP a secular-socialist colour. BJP’s top leadership at a Jaipur meeting decided that initiatives would have to be taken to bring the Muslim community close to it at all costs, that a movement would have to be launched to fight corruption at every level, that the poor’s welfare oriented economic policies would have to be forcefully advocated, that a movement would have to be launched against foreign companies, and that a fight to the finish would have to be started against the forces retarding BJP’s march to power.</description>

24. A good augury
 Sir, - It is heartening to note that the Bharatiya Janata Party, of late, has realised its folly of isolating Muslims. In Kerala it is organising meetings in which intellectuals of both the communities exchange their views so as to remove the misunderstandings and misconceptions between them. In these conclaves, efforts are made to cultivate and establish healthy relationship between the two communities.</description>

25. Muslims in Behrampada voted
in a pragmatic way
By Anil Singh
 MUMBAI: Simply put, it was gutter-level politics, quite literally, which helped the Shiv Sena win the civic seat from Behrampada. The Sena was the only party which got the drains cleaned and had toilets built for the women of this Muslim-dominated slum in Bandra east.
Apart from their work in the area, a host of other factors went into ensuring the Sena’s victory in the slum which witnessed some of the bloodiest communal riots in December 1992-January 1993.</description>

 MUMBAI, MARCH 8 - Chief Minister Manohar Joshi’s assurance to a delegation of Catholic leaders, last month, has surprised Mangalprabhat Lodha, BJP MLA from Malabar Hill.
The issue is the Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill, introduced by Lodha as a private member’s Bill in the last Assembly session at Nagpur. The Bill seeks to make the use of force or allurement for religious conversion a cognisable offence in the State.</description>

 AYODHYA. March 28 - The Vishwa Hindu Parishad in a major policy shift has dropped its “Direct action Plan” to “liberate” Kashi and Mathura.
At the three-day in-camera proceedings of the VHP which concluded at Karsevakpuram here today, the front ranking leaders of the parishad abandoned programmes to launch movement to “liberate” the two shrines by taking possession of the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and the Shahi Mosque in Mathura which they consider encroachment upon the Lord Vishwanath Temple and Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple respectively.</description>

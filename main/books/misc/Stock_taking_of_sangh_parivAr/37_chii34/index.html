<p><strong>34. (Mrs) Veda Sampath</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>First Document:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Muhammad is Allah’s messenger, and a mortal human being. Hence he
is only an intermediary, which is also the claim made by his votaries.
Some sentimental Hindus may have no objection to count him as a saint.
But there is no question of his being included in the category of
Hindu Gods.</p>
<p>Jesus is considered as the Son of God. But according to Christian
belief, he presented himself as a martyr for the sake of humanity. No
Hindu God is known to have suffered as a martyr. On the contrary,
Hindu Gods are known to have protected their devotees and eliminated
evil people with might and force. Hence there is no scope for Jesus
being counted among Hindu Gods.</p>
<p>2. Islam entertains the notion that it is the only true religion, and
that all other religions are anti-God. This notion is not true.
Moreover, Islam says that God cannot be reached except through the
mediation of Muhammad. On the other hand, according to Hinduism God is
accessible to all human beings who follow the path of truthfulness and
goodness. Moreover, Hinduism does not command its followers to
struggle for spreading the faith in a particular god.</p>
<p>3. Not everything in Islam is bad, nor are all Muslims bad. It cannot
also be maintained that all Muslims are necessarily good. Elements of
intolerance that have got built into Islam, may be explained as due to
certain historico-geographical circumstances - for instance, Jihad and
conquest of non-Muslims. Similarly, some of its social injunctions may
have arisen in past contingencies, and look like injustices in the
present situation. But so long as Muslims refuse to renounce practices
like Jihãd and Talãq, and regard them as enjoined by their religion,
they will continue to carry the tag of ‘bad people’.</p>
<p>4. Undoubtedly, Muslims are very well aware of their Indian ancestry.
But now that they consider themselves as Muslims, there should be no
objection to that on any ground. Secondly, we should take into account
the extraordinary circumstances under which they got converted. They
should be left to live as they are. How on earth can the Muslims get
reconverted to Hinduism in view of the Hindu VarNa-Jãti system?</p>
<p>5. It is a proven fact that the British were the first to make
political capital out of Hindu-Muslim differences. The Congress at
that time felt compelled to make some concessions to Muslims in order
to remove their fears due to their situation as a minority.
Unfortunately, subsequent political leaders with the exception of
Sardar Patel, converted their ‘minority situation’ into a ‘Minority
Status’. And sure enough, Muslim leaders, having tasted special
privileges, have brought pressures on the Government to placate the
Muslims and resisted all attempts at national integration. The Hindu
Brahmin class has also to share the blame for creating a class of
Untouchables, and thus preventing the formation of a merit-based
society. So unless sincere efforts are made towards establishment of a
National Identity, Muslims, like other weak or strong communities,
will continue to look at themselves as a distinct group.</p>
<p>The assumption that Muslims as a whole consider the BJP as Kafirs is
perhaps an exaggeration. It is true, however, that Muslims as well as
other Hindu vested interests have done great harm to the BJP by
presenting it as a political party whose sole aim is to attack Muslims
and oust them from India in due course of time. Thanks to the Congress
version of Secularism, this concept has been devalued both politically
and ethically. The small cultural differences between Hindus and
Muslims have been widened and made to look as irreconcilable political
and religious differences. The ruling parties have been thriving on
this artificially created barrier.</p>
<p>6. All mystics are the best humanitarians. Looking at the lives and
literature of Sufi poets, they do not appear to be particularly
anti-Hindu or pro-Islam. As regards Shah Waliullah and the Sufis of
Bijapur, my guess is that they became fanatics due to loss of status
as rulers. The religious fanaticism of the Bijapur Sultans and their
persecution of Hindus is a documented fact. It is quite possible that
some sufis-in-the-making might have lent their literary talents to the
Sultans presumably under coercion.</p>
<p>7. Some Muslim theologians and politicians have forced a ghetto
mentality on Indian Muslims by instilling fear of traditional Hindus
in their already insecure minds. But as of now this artificial
separation is getting erased. And dispassionate and patriotic efforts
by Hindu and Muslim politicians and intellectuals should be able to
bring the two communities together in positively meaningful ways.</p>
<p>8. Considering the Islamic doctrine of Jihãd, there is no such thing
as a disputed site. But Muslims could have looked at it (Ayodhya) in a
secular context. The point about Ayodhya is <em>not</em> that it is not a
place of worship for Muslims, but that it is a place of tremendous
significance for Hindus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Second Document</strong></p>
<p>I am one with Dr. Godbole in his apprehensions about the Sangh’s
over-zealousness as evident in the Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch. Islam with
its exclusivist claims and its sanction for the destruction of other
people’s places of worship, makes its adherents intolerant towards the
rest of mankind. This is a grave matter in the present context when many
multi-religious nations have come to exist or, in other words, when
mono-religious states have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The concept of Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch is nothing but the concept of
Secularism which introduces an outside agent the supposedly non-communal
mediator. What is the authority on the basis of which this agent of
reconciliation or equator, puts forward his appeal? If the basis is
Humanism, well, it has been tried out far too many times and has not
worked. In case the Manch works at the cultural level, it is certainly
more honest than Secularism which has been used solely for the political
convenience and advantage of the ruling class. But if it is used as a
religious platform, particularly in democratic and free India, it is no
more than a farce.</p>
<p>In my opinion Islam and Christianity should not be equated with Marxism
and called double-distilled Materialism. Such an equation is no better
than equating religion with Fascism.</p>

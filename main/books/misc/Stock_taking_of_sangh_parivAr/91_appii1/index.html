<p><strong>1. Population Explosion in</strong><br>
<strong>West Bengal: A Survey</strong><br>
(A Study by South Asia Research Society, Calcutta)</p>
</div>
<p>On account of the Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, refugees
moved from Pakistan, without much interruption, to various parts of
India, especially to West Bengal, till 1971, when political boundaries
in South Asia were redrawn. Even after the emergence of Bangladesh as an
independent country in 1971, however, the march of refugees to West
Bengal appeared to be ceaseless. Nevertheless, there is one great
difference in the patterns of migration before and after 1971. In the
days of Pakistan, nearly all refugees coming to West Bengal were members
of the minority communities in East Bengal (East Pakistan), viz.
Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. In the Bangladesh era, however, in
addition to the forced migration of members of minority community (the
overwhelming majority being Hindus) to West Bengal, there has been
largescale voluntary infiltration of Bangladeshi Muslims (forming the
majority community in that country) to West Bengal and other parts of
India. Certainly, the Government of India and the Government of West
Bengal are not unaware of this grim phenomenon. Occasionally, the Home
Minister of the Government of India and the Chief Minister of West
Bengal have expressed serious concern over this problem. This brief
survey - its brevity attributable to the barrier of needless secrecy
against the free flow of census data (unexpected in a democratic country
like India) - aims at unraveling the mystery of population explosion in
a progressive state like West Bengal, as also at arousing the
consciousness of the public about the factor of migration /infiltration
underlying this explosion, which cannot but pose a mounting challenge to
vital national interests.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1.1: Population in West Bengal 1941-91</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>Source: <strong>Statistical Abstract, West Bengal, 1978-89</strong> (Combined Issue),
Bureau of Applied Economics and Statistics.</p>
<p>In accordance with estimates prepared by the Government of West Bengal,
44.5 lakhs of refugees came from East Bengal (East Pakistan) to West
Bengal during 1946-1970.^(<a href="#1">1</a>) The 1981 Census contained an
important clue to the persistence of migration / infiltration to West
Bengal. The population growth rate declined from 26.9% in 1961-71 to
23.2% in 1971-81. Yet, the 1981 Census recorded a population of 4,67,000
in excess of the population derived from differences in birth /death
rates. If one excluded these 4,67,000 persons - who obviously moved to
West Bengal from other regions inside/outside India - the population
growth rate in 1971-81 would have declined from 23.2% to 22.1%.
Actually, in West Bengal, on account of an expansion of education and
family planning programmes, as also of a pronounced rise in social
consciousness, the population growth rate during 1981-91 should have
fallen below 22%, and demographic experts of the Government of India
perceptively forecast the rate of 20.79% for this period. Evidently,
this forecast was upset by migration /infiltration from Bangladesh. For,
the 1991 Census puts the decadal growth rate at 24.55%, i.e. higher than
that in 1971-81. Where and how could this unexpected rate of population
growth take place?^(<a href="#2">2</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Natural Population Increase in 1981-91:</strong></p>
<p>Every year the Registrar General of India conducts sample surveys, and
estimates the annual rates of birth and death. Table 1.2 communicates
these rates for West Bengal during 1981-90.</p>

decade, i.e. r₁ r₂ …. r₁₀, and in accordance with the formula, viz R =
(1+ r₁) (1+r₂) (1+r₃) …. (1+r₁₀) - 1.] The estimate of the expert
committee on population growth rate was 1.1% below 21.9%, i.e. the rate
of natural increase during 1981-91. Nevertheless, the actual population
growth rate exceeded the rate of natural population increase by 2.7%,
and stood at 24.6% during 1981-91. This increase can largely be
accounted for by the influx of people from Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and
other regions of India. Thus, the number of migrants / infiltrators to
West Bengal during 1981-91 can be calculated at 14,74,000, i.e. 11% of
the total population increase of 1,34,00,000.^(<a href="#3">3</a>) The actual
number of outsiders in West Bengal is likely to be much higher, because
a very large number of them have presumably escaped detection by Census
personnel.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that, during 1971-81 and 1981-91, West Bengal has
accommodated 2 million outsiders.  Actually, this number should be much
larger, because, from Bangladesh alone, 2.95 million Bengali-speaking
Hindus have entered into India (mainly West Bengal) during
1974-1991.^(<a href="#4">4</a>) As Mohiuddin Ahmed, a renowned journalist of
Bangladesh, writes: “Thus, we encounter a scenario of ‘missing Hindu
population’ in the successive census periods. The extent of this missing
population was about 1.22 million during the period of 1974-1981, and
about 1.73 million during the last intercensual period 1981-91. As many
as 475 Hindus are ‘disappearing’ every day from the soil of Bangladesh
on an average since 1974. How this phenomenon would be interpreted in
terms of demography? The relevant parameter is obviously ‘migration’
which provides a clue to the missing link.”^(<a href="#5">5</a>) The following
Table illustrates the rise and fall of Hindu and Muslim population in
the last fifty year in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Source: <strong>Bangladesh Population Census in 1981 and 91.</strong></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that, of the nearly ten million Hindu refugees leaving
East Pakistan for India in course of the 1971 liberation struggle, a
large number did not return to Bangladesh. Moreover, of those who
returned, a big number, failing to recover movable / immovable
properties looted / misappropriated during 1971, came back to India in
one or two years. These refugees have not been taken into account by the
Bangladesh Census reports. Their number soars above 3 million.^(<a href="#6">6</a>)</p>
<p>After the successful conclusion of the Bangladesh liberation struggle in
1971, only 2,00,000 out of 1 million stranded non-Bengalis (usually
called Biharis) in Bangladesh, could obtain help from International Red
Cross Society in order to move over to Pakistan. The Government of
Pakistan trumped up a variety of excuses to avoid the repatriation of
the other 8,00,000 Biharis, who were compelled to stay on in Bangladesh.
As of late 1994 - i.e. after the lapse of 23 years since 1971 - only
2,50,000 Biharis were found to be living amidst subhuman conditions at
66 camps in Bangladesh.^(<a href="#7">7</a>) Actually, in terms of a natural
population increase, the 8,00,000 Biharis should have swelled to more
than 1.3 million by 1994. To the question of where have the more than 1
million Biharis vanished from Bangladesh since 1971, the obvious answer
is, they have surreptitiously moved into their ancestral places in India
(notably in Bihar), and settled down. In one of his recent election
utterances, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the Chief Minister of Bihar, has
confessed to granting ration cards and voting rights to 100,000 Biharis
from Bangladesh.^(<a href="#8">8</a>) It may be added that some Governments have
loudly complained about infiltration of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis into
such important cities as Bombay and New Delhi.</p>
<p>In addition, for the 1981-91 period, Bangladesh Census authorities
detect the somewhat unique phenomenon of “missing population”, and
estimates the number at 8 million.^(<a href="#9">9</a>) As already indicated, 1.73
million Hindus are to be included in the figure of 8 million. It is,
therefore, entirely plausible that the remainder of 8 million, i.e. 6.27
million Muslims, have infiltrated into various parts of India, notably
West Bengal. The Government of Bangladesh naturally observes silence on
this vital issue, this silence being occasionally broken by a hackneyed
repetition of the announcement that there are no Bangladeshis in India.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, pertinent to affirm that 6 million Hindus have left
Bangladesh for India during 1971-1991, and not less than 6 million
Bangladeshi Muslims have infiltrated into India during 1981-1991. To
this should be added 1 million stranded Biharis in Bangladesh moving to
India. Since the extent of Muslim infiltration during 1971-1981 awaits
appraisal, it is fair to conclude that at least - at least - 13-14
million migrants/infiltrators have crossed over from Bangladesh to India
from 1971 to 1991. A large number of these outsiders have taken shelter
in various parts of West Bengal, including the sensitive border areas.
In order to facilitate a clear comprehension of this phenomenon, we
provide below a Table recording the district wise population growth rate
in West Bengal as also the categorisation of this population by
religion. It is not logical to explain this growth by reference to
migration from other states in India to West Bengal. For, in course of
the 1981-1991 decade, West Bengal has witnessed a decrease, rather than
increase, of employment in the organised sector.^(<a href="#10">10</a>) As to
migrants from Bhutan and Nepal, they mostly reside in the districts of
Coochbehar, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri, whereas their number is too
insignificant in comparison to the number of migrants from Bangladesh.</p>

<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p>The Census reports of 1981 and 1991 indicate that, in course of the
1981-91 decade, the number of Hindus in West Bengal has decreased by
2.27%, whereas the number of Muslims in West Bengal has increased by
2.06%. Whereas the number of Hindus in West Bengal has risen by 21.05%,
the number of Muslims in West Bengal has shot up by 36.67%. In every
district of West Bengal, the contrast between a decline in Hindu
population and an extraordinary upswing in Muslim population is indeed
remarkable. Even in Calcutta itself, the Muslim population has gone up
by 53.67%, but the Hindu population has moved up by 30.79%. In a number
of districts, the rate of growth of Muslim population is double or more
than double that of Hindu population. Six such districts are listed
below:</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in Calcutta, Nadia and West Dinajpur, the rate of
growth of Hindu population has surpassed the decadal growth rate of
24.55%. In other districts, the rate of growth of Hindu population is
much below 24.55%. In contrast, in every district of West Bengal, the
rate of growth of Muslim population is much higher than 24.55%.</p>
<p>Table 1.4 demonstrates how this acute disparity in the rates of
population growth translates itself into actual population figures. For
example, in the district of Maldah, the number of Hindus has gone up
from 11,07,192 in 1981 to 13,77,000 in 1991, registering a net increase
of 2,69,808. In sharp contrast, the number of Muslims has shot up from
9,19,918 in 1981 to 12,52,000 in 1991, the net increase being 3,32,082.
In other words, in ten years, the Muslim population has leapt from being
45.27% of the total population to being 47.47%, whereas the Hindu
population has come down from forming 54.49% of the total population to
forming 52.21%. Keeping in view such a fast-changing demographic
scenario, one can certainly start worrying about the future of West
Bengal.</p>
<p>A pertinent query is whether the excessively high rate of growth of
Muslim population in all the districts of West Bengal is solely due to
infiltration by Bangladeshis. Alternatively, one can ask whether it is
permissible to affirm that Muslims in West Bengal are far less concerned
about birth control, and far more backward in family planning, than
Hindus in West Bengal.</p>
<p>In the Muslim society, the impact of religious propaganda upon daily
life is enormous. Fundamentalist notions are growing stronger among
Muslims. The belief that Islam opposes birth control is still prevalent.
Not to speak of Fatwas (directives) from Mullahs or Maulanas, even
preachings by a section of Muslim intellectuals have reinforced this
belief. Far from the introduction of compulsory measures in public
interest, neither the Government of India nor any state Government has
even encouraged voluntary birth control among Muslims. Consequently,
even though population control is universally recognised today as a key
contributor to economic upliftment, the GRP among Muslims is very high.
Actually, in nearly all Muslim countries of the world - whether in the
richest or the poorest category - the total fertility rate (TFR) is
significantly high, as is the GRP.^(<a href="#11">11</a>) It may be relevant in
this context to refer to Bangladesh Contraceptive Survey, 1991, which
observes: “It has been found that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) among
the non-Muslims is relatively lower than among the Muslims, the
difference ranged from 7% to 12% in the eighties. It has never been
claimed that the Hindus have higher mortality rate. It is likely that
they have lower mortality rate due to higher extent of immunisation
among their children.”^(<a href="#12">12</a>) There is no reason why this
observation about Bangladesh should not be applicable to Hindus and
Muslims in West Bengal too.</p>
<p>The above noted facts - and the attendant analyses - make it quite clear
that, on account of ceaseless infiltration from Bangladesh, and the
tremendously high rate of growth of Muslim population, West Bengal, with
766 persons per square kilometer, has emerged as the state having the
highest density of population in the whole of India. West Bengal
occupies 2.77% of India’s land area, and accommodates 8.06% of its
population. The actual pressure of population upon West Bengal may
indeed be higher than what is estimated from Census data, which are
seldom complete.</p>

<p>We cannot be sufficiently grateful to Dr. Godbole for having questioned
the validity of a thesis advanced by the BJP think-tank and its allied
organisations with a view to creating a constituency among the Indian
Muslims who form barely 12% of the total population of India. The BJP
brains trust has devised an agenda of which the eight formulations
pointed out by Dr. Godbole form the core. Dr. Godbole has debunked each
of the formulations with irrefutable and cogent arguments.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that anyone, much less the BJP which is wedded to
the cause of Hindus and India, could have advanced an irrational,
untenable and an unworkable thesis such as this. More than the Hindus,
Muslims themselves will reject this thesis out of hand if not with utter
contempt. This approach of the BJP also indicates total intellectual
bankruptcy and abysmal ignorance of those who are supposed to know
better. At the least, the BJP should not have overlooked its obligation
towards the people (read Hindus) who had put their faith in it and in
its ability to guide and lead the nation, not to indulge in such
puerilities and mindlessness. The real problem is not the Muslim but the
Hindu who has elevated his pusillanimity into a high grade philosophy of
life which he is not prepared to give up at any price, even though it
has cost him very heavily again and again. What is the problem with the
Hindu? Here is Nirad C Chaudhry’s answer: “By the time the Muslims
established their rule in the country (circa 1200 A.D.) the old
inhabitants of the country, i.e. the Hindus, had lost their vitality to
such an extent that they became incapable of dealing with or even facing
a situation if it was difficult or unpleasant. So they surrendered to
any situation that was created for them by history and tried to be at
peace with their conscience by banishing it from their mind with
soothing words.”</p>
<p>Is the BJP brand of Hindu any different? Does the BJP thesis not amount
to mere soothing verbiage? Does the Hindu understand the Muslim psyche
or Islam? A quote from another distinguished author, V.S. Naipaul, is
relevant: “You have a real problem now in India. Very few Hindus know
what Islam is. Very few Hindus have studied it or given it any thought.
And you cannot appeal to Muslim intellectuals. Islam is a religion of
revelation. The Prophet’s revelations are final. The laws have been all
issued. Other societies adapt as the need arises, as traditions change,
as the world changes. You adopt new attitudes to crime and deviance.
This constant re-assessment is impossible in Islam. All that you can do
is to re-interpret the Prophet’s decrees. This is one reason why on the
Muslim side reforms are not talked about much. If someone says we have
to rethink, the believer would say, how dare you? You can be a reformist
in Hindu tradition and you will not be considered a heretic. But any
Muslim who talks about reforms in a fundamental way will commit heresy.
It was so in Christianity at the time of Galileo. It is an immense
intellectual problem for the educated Muslims of India.”</p>
<p>So, the tragedy of the Hindu is twofold.  Firstly, he has lost the
vitality to live a life in which his self-respect, self-esteem and
dignity is assured. Secondly, he does not understand the true nature of
either Christianity or Islam, not even such despicable terms as Heathen,
Kafir and Dar-ul-Harb which directly concern him.</p>
<p>Of all the formulations the one which astounds the most is the one
mentioned at No. 5 which reads, “Congress used Muslims. We (BJP) will
treat Muslims as human beings.” The implications of this formulation are
extremely damaging to the Hindus and the cause of Hinduism. It presumes
that Muslims in India are being maltreated and that they are not getting
a fair deal even in secular India. Nothing could be farther from the
truth. Apart from giving the Muslims an undeserved opportunity to malign
India as a nation practising the worst kind of discrimination against
them, namely, that they have not been treated as human beings, this
formulation also hides the fact that the boot is on the other foot. In
reality, it is the Hindus, though in majority, who have been at the
receiving end at the hands of the Muslim minority, throughout history.
Let us consider the record of Muslim violence against Hindu in Pakistan,
Bangladesh and India after 1947. There is no need to go back to earlier
centuries because the blood-stained history of Muslim rulers is much too
well known. We shall also consider the present day attitude of the
Muslims towards the Hindus and India, and the position of Hindus
vis-à-vis Muslims or Hinduism versus Islam in the Indian sub-continent.</p>
<p>Since 1947, the Muslims have subjected the Hindus to repeated genocide
which has permanently altered the demographic status of the Hindus to
their everlasting disadvantage with potential for faith erosion.</p>
<p>The first genocide of Hindus and Sikhs in West Pakistan was carried out
and completed in less than three months in 1947 with unprecedented
butchery and thoroughness. Lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs were slaughtered
and millions of them driven out of their centuries-old hearths and
homes. The cataclysmic results of this terrible ‘ethnic cleansing’ of
Hindus and Sikhs were momentous in more ways than one. Firstly, Hinduism
and Sikhism disappeared from the western wing of the newly constituted
state of Pakistan. Secondly, West Pakistan became a single-religion
country. One could understand the secular intellectuals deliberately
closing their eyes to these horrendous realities, but why the BJP?</p>
<p>The second genocide of Hindus was organised and masterminded by the
Muslims in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The Hindu minority which
constituted 30% of the total population of East Pakistan in 1947, though
not “ethnically cleansed” instantly like the Hindus and Sikhs in West
Pakistan, became victim of a different kind of genocide which was even
worse in terms of savagery and barbarism. This was genocide by slow
haemorrhage. The Islamic terrorists in Bangladesh (in fact the entire
nation practised terrorism against Hindus) resorted to riots actively
engineered by the government, and went on with bloodshed, destruction
and forcible occupation of Hindu property, abduction and rape of Hindu
women, enforcement of Islamic laws which were utterly unjust, and denial
of civil and human rights which left no options for the Hindus but to
either convert to Islam or migrate to India and rot on the streets of
Calcutta. The Muslims of East Pakistan practised the worst kind of
Islamic terrorism towards the Hindus. Consequently, Hindu population in
East Pakistan/Bangladesh has been reduced from 30% in 1947 to less than
10% in 1991.</p>
<p>This unending diaspora which began in 1947, culminated in the
unprecedented migration of ten million Hindus to India in 1971 when
Pakistan was caught in the throes of a bloody civil war which led to the
break up of the country and emergence of Bangladesh as an independent
Islamic state. What did those millions of Hindu migrants refugees
experience in the camps in India? The quality of life in those camps was
by all standards subhuman and the number of refugees dying of hunger,
fatigue, malnutrition, exhaustion and diseases of all kinds was so large
that when a camp commandant was asked as to what he needed most to run
his camp, his reply was - a crematorium! Such were the consequences of
this interminable genocide of Hindus. But did this genocide end with the
termination of the civil war in Pakistan and emergence of Bangladesh?
No. The stone of Islamic fundamentalism never stops grinding the
non-Muslims (Hindus in particular) into dust. The pogrom of Hindus in
Bangladesh continues unabated.</p>
<p>Now we come to the third genocide of Hindus which has been carried out
as ruthlessly by the Muslims in Kashmir (a part of India) as in Islamic
Pakistan and Bangladesh. Kashmiri Hindus (commonly known as Kashmiri
Pandits) were barely 3.95% and living in the midst of Muslims who
constituted 94.6% of the total population of the Kashmir Valley. They
were a tiny minority and posed no threat to the Muslims. Yet they have
been “ethnically cleansed” after being subjected to the usual “Islamic
treatment” and now they too are languishing in refugee camps. Not a
single secular saint (read devil) in India has shed a tear for these
Hindus living miserably in filth and poverty. Is the Hindu destined to
suffer indignities and other horrors at the hands of Muslim? It seems
so.</p>
<p>These three genocides have had devastating effect on the demographic
status of Hindus in the Indian sub-continent. These are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, Hinduism and Sikhism have totally disappeared from 9,56,040
sq. km. area of the Indian sub-continent (Pakistan 7,96,095 sq. km.,
Bangladesh 1,44,000 sq. km. and Kashmir Valley 15,095 sq. km.). This
area is approximately 1/4th of the area of pre-Partition India.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of territorial spread, Islam occupies the top slot
and Hinduism has been relegated to the second position in the Indian
sub-continent. While Islam is flourishing in Pakistan, Bangladesh and
India, Hinduism is confined to India only.</p>
<p>Thirdly, while Pakistan and Bangladesh are exclusively meant for the
Muslims, in India Muslims are the shareholders along with the Hindus
and others. Thus the Muslims are having the cake and eating it too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the demographic profile of Hindus and Muslims in the Indian
sub-continent which should be cause for serious concern to every
Hindu:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>Hindus</em></td>
<td><em>Muslims</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>India</td>
<td>700 million</td>
<td>120 million</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pakistan</td>
<td>nil      '&rsquo;</td>
<td>130      '&rsquo;</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>710    '&rsquo;</td>
<td>380      '&rsquo;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus for 710 million Hindus there are 380 million Muslims or less than 2
Hindus for 1 Muslim in the Indian sub-continent. How long will the
Hindus be able to maintain this ratio? Not for very long. But our
secular angels (read demons) would protest and say without questioning
these figures that Hindus in India are 80% and Muslims only 12%, so
where is the danger? Yes, where is the danger indeed?</p>
<p>The problem with our secular saints and angels is that they were blind
in 1947 and they continue to be blind even in 1997 – after a lapse of
fifty years. They did not see the threat of Islamic genocides looming
large over India in 1947, and they cannot see the threat emanating from
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indian Muslims today.</p>
<p>Now let us have a look at the extraordinary arrogance of Indian Muslims
who had supported the cause of Pakistan wholeheartedly prior to 1947. In
the elections held in 1946, the Muslim League led by Jinnah won all the
30 Muslim seats in the Central Assembly and 427 out of the 507 Muslim
seats in the Provincial legislatures. The North-West Frontier Province
was the only exception where the Congress-Red Shirt alliance came to
power. Thus, by the logic of voting and massive support to the cause of
Pakistan, the Indian Muslims forfeited their right to live in India
after Partition on 15th August 1947. Thus they should have, on their
own, migrated to Pakistan. But they did not. The extraordinary spirit of
humanity that was extended to them by the Hindus, who allowed them to
continue to live in India as equal citizens, drew little appreciation
from the Muslims. Ingratitude towards infidels is fundamental to Muslim
psyche and character. Now, fifty years later, the Indian Muslim has
become as arrogant as he was before 1947 and carries his Islamic
haughtiness right on his collars. He stubbornly refuses to be a part of
the Indian nation as the following would show:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Indian Muslim has not accepted any part of India’s
Constitution except that relating to fundamental and minority rights.</p>
<p>2. He has outright rejected the Common Civil Code for the nation.</p>
<p>3. He has rejected Vande Mataram which is our national song.</p>
<p>4. He does not accept Hindi as the national language even in Hindi
speaking states. His preference is invariably for Urdu.</p>
<p>5. He has never condemned the ethnic cleansing of Hindus in the
Kashmir Valley.</p>
<p>6. He has never condemned Muslim infiltration from Bangladesh. In
fact, he tacitly supports the cause of illegal Bangladeshi
infiltration because this adds to his numerical strength and political
clout in the country.</p>
<p>7. He refuses to accept the fact that there is no such thing as the
Muslim Ummah except as an anti-Hindu Front. If there was such a thing,
why has Saudi Arabia expelled thousands of Bangladesh nationals who
are all Muslims? Again, why has Pakistan refused to accept eight lakh
Bihari Muslims who are languishing in camps in Bangladesh since 1971?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plain and simple truth about the Indian Muslim is that he is a
blackmailer par excellence. He blackmailed the nation before 1947 and he
is blackmailing the nation today. Why has all this escaped the notice of
the BJP think-tank? Ideologically, religiously, politically and
socially, it is the Muslims who have treated the Hindus, despite the
latter’s larger number, as less than human beings throughout history. It
is the absence of this realisation and truth in the BJP thesis which is
astounding. On the contrary, it plans to treat the Muslims as human
beings, perhaps for the sake of their votes. What a travesty of
historical and present-day realities relating to Muslims in India!</p>
<p>Every Hindu must consider the entire gamut of Muslim atrocities on
Hindus from the time of Muhammad bin Qasim in the early eighth century
down to Muslim League’s genocide of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan from
August 1947 to September 1947. In the intervening centuries - from the
eighth to the twentieth - there was no respite for the Hindus from
Islamic atrocities. Hindus did not escape this fate even during the
British rule.</p>
<p>What is it that explains such terrible animus on the part of Muslims
against Hindus called idolators? The answer is simple and straight. The
fault lies not so much with Muslims as with Islamic theology, which,
according to Muslims, is revelatory and hence cannot be changed,
modified or amended. Any such attempt would mean heresy which would
invite the penalty of death. It is this aspect of Islamic theology which
has completely escaped the notice of the BJP think-tank while drawing up
a new charter for integrating Islam with Hinduism. Let us, therefore
consider some of the notable verses in the Quran which provide necessary
sanction for shedding the blood of non-believers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. In 9: 29, Allah resorts to swearing: The Unbelievers are impure
and their abode is hell.</p>
<p>2. On unbelievers is the curse of Allah (2: 161).</p>
<p>3. Allah is an enemy to unbelievers (2: 98).</p>
<p>4. Allah mocks the unbelievers (2: 15).</p>
<p>5. Unbelievers are the enemies of Allah and they will roast in hell
(41: 14).</p>
<p>6. Muslims are the best of all nations (3: 110). Thus they are
superior people, entitled to dominate the rest of the mankind.</p>
<p>7. O Ye who believe! Murder those of the disbelievers… and let them
find harshness in you (9: 123).</p>
<p>8. Humiliate the non-Muslims to such an extent that they surrender
and pay tribute (9: 29).</p>
<p>9. Certainly Allah is an enemy to the unbelievers (2: 60).</p>
<p>10. Allah has cursed the unbelievers and proposed for them a blazing
hell (33: 60).</p>
<p>11. O Believers! do not make friends with the Jews and Christians…
whoso of you makes them his friend is one of them (5: 55).</p>
<p>12. Muslims are harsh against the unbelievers, merciful to one
another (48: 25).</p>
<p>13. Fight against them until idolatry is no more and Allah’s religion
reigns supreme (2: 193).</p>
<p>14. Make war on them until idolatry is no more and Allah’s religion
reigns supreme (8: 39).</p>
<p>15. Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it. But you
may hate a thing although it is good for you, and love a thing
although it is bad for you. Allah knows, but you do not (2: 216).</p>
<p>16. Believers! make war on the infidels who dwell around you. Let
them find harshness in you (9: 123).</p>
<p>17. O Prophet! make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and
deal sternly with them. Hell shall be their home, evil their fate (66:
9).</p>
<p>18. O Prophet! make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrisies. Be
harsh with them. Their ultimate abode is Hell, a hapless journey’s end
(9: 73).</p>
<p>19. O Prophet! exhort the believers to fight. If there are twenty
steadfast men among you, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for
they are devoid of understanding (8: 65-66).</p>
<p>20. Muhammad is Allah’s aspostle. Those who follow him are ruthless
to the unbelievers but merciful to one another… Through them Allah
seeks to enrage the unbelievers (48:29).</p>
<p>21. Allah will humble the unbelievers. Allah and His apostle are free
from obligation to the idol-worshippers. Proclaim a woeful punishment
to the unbelievers (9: 2-3).</p>
<p>22. When the sacred months are over slay the idol-worshippers
wherever you find them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush
everywhere for them. If they repent and take to prayer and pay the
alms-tax, let them go their way. Allah is forgiving and merciful
(.9:5).</p>
<p>23. We renounce you (i.e. the idolaters): enmity and hate shall reign
between us until you believe in Allah only (60.4).</p>
<p>24. Allah and His apostle pose no trust in idolaters (9: 7).</p>
<p>25. The basest creatures in the sight of Allah are the faithless who
will not believe… (8: 55).</p>
<p>26. Believers! do not befriend your fathers or you brothers if they
choose unbelief in preference to faith. Wrong-doers are those that
befriend them (9: 23).</p>
<p>27. Believers! know that the idolaters are unclean (9: 28).</p>
<p>28. Therefore, We stirred among them (i.e. the Christians) enmity and
hatred, which shall endure till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah
will declare to them all that they have done (5: 14).</p>
<p>29. Unbelievers are those who declare: ‘Allah is the Messiah (i.e.
Christ), the son of Mary.’ Say: ‘who could prevent Allah from
destroying the Messiah (i.e. Christ), the son of Mary, together with
his mother and all the people of the earth?’ (5: 17).</p>
<p>30. The unbelievers among the people of the Book (i.e. Christians and
Jews) and the pagans shall bum for ever in the fire of Hell. They are
the vilest of all creatures (98: 5 1).</p>
<p>31. Garments of fire have been prepared for unbelievers. Scalding
water shall be poured upon their heads, melting their skins and that
which is in their bellies. They shall be lashed with red hot iron (22:
19-22).</p>
<p>32. Tell the unbelievers that if they mend their ways (i.e. embrace
Islam) their past shall be forgiven: but if they persist in sin (i.e.
idol-worshipping) let them reflect upon the fate of their forefathers
(8: 38).</p>
<p>33. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off
their heads, maim them in every limb (8: 12).</p>
<p>34. We shall say, ‘Lay hold of him and bind him. Burn him in the fire
of Hell, then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long. For he did
not believe in Allah, the Most High…’ (8: 15-18).</p>
<p>35. Do not yield to the unbelievers, but fight them strenuously with
this Koran (25: 52).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reading of the above directives from Allah leaves no doubt that so far
as non-Muslims or non-believers are concerned, the Quran is not a
religious book at all but a war manual and a penal code. This aspect of
the Quran does not seem to have drawn sufficient attention or
appreciation of the BJP think-tank; had it done so there is little doubt
that it would have realised the impossibility of the task of
incorporating Muhammad as one of the Gods or Avatars of the Hindu
pantheon.</p>
<p>Does Hinduism have the equivalent of warlike terms like Ghanima,
Mujahid, Shahid, Jiziya, Zimmi, Jihad, Dar-ul-Islam, Dar-ul-Harb, Ghazi
etc. in any one of its scriptures? None at all. The Quran, which is said
to be a revealed book with the master copy lying in the custody of Allah
in high heavens, is replete with these terms. How can these terms be
homogenised with Hinduism?</p>
<p>The very attempt of the BJP think-tank is not merely puerile and naive
but egregiously childish.</p>
<p>The same goes for Christ whom the Christians claim to be the only son of
God and one who, two thousand years ago, atoned for the sins of all
humanity before and after him. How stupid and ridiculous! Christians may
have some religious compulsions to implicitly believe in the dogmas but
no Hindu can do so.</p>
<p>The utter impactibility of the eight formulations also comes into high
relief when we consider these in the context of demographic status of
Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and other religions in the world.</p>
<p>Compared with Christianity and Islam, which are spread over several
countries, Hinduism is confined to just one or two countries. Why? The
BJP think-tank must provide answer not only to this question but also
whether its formulations are the right answers to the challenges posed
by Christianity and Islam to Hinduism. I, for one, would not buy the
thesis of the BJP think-tank.</p>
<p>However, the year 2000 of the Christian Calendar is only three years
away. It is just the appropriate time to cogitate over the miseries and
misfortunes that we Hindus suffered first at the hands of the Islamic
imperialism and then the Christian-Western colonialism, and what we can
or should do to recover our amour-propre. As a number of leading lights
among Hindus think and propagate that the 21st century and future
belongs to Hindus and Hinduism, one would like to know how? Mere
expression of wishes is not enough.</p>
<p>In my exposition I have largely confined myself to formulations Nos. 3
and 5 only. So far as other formulations are concerned, they are merely
offshoots of the two discussed above. In respect of these also I fully
agree with the views of Dr. Godbole. Will the BJP think-tank care to
have a second look at its own thesis?</p>

<p>In the hierarchy of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha, Dr. Shreerang
Godbole is only a <em>Swayamsevak</em>. One wishes he was the <em>Sarsanghchãlak</em>
or the <em>Sarkaryavãh</em>. For, the ideological clarity, historical
perception, understanding of national issues and intellectual awareness
that he has exhibited in his two short write-ups, have been so sadly
lacking in the top-brass of the organisation.</p>
<p>The RSS was started by its illustrious founder Dr. K.B. Hedgewar because
of his prime conviction that Mahatma Gandhi’s efforts during the
Khilafat agitation to coalesce Hindu and Muslim national aspirations
into one, were misplaced and futile. Dr. Hedgewar had realized that
Hindus had the right as well as need to pursue their national interests
in their own homeland. He correctly perceived that Muslim intransigence
born out of their loyalty to an alien culture and ex-ruler syndrome and
their consequent separatist demand, were bound to come in conflict with
Hindu national aspirations.</p>
<p>Dr. Hedgewar’s perception was well-founded on a millennium of history
and authorities like Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda.^(<a href="#1">1</a>) He
tried to organize Hindus into a dedicated, disciplined force which would
acquire the strength to defend Hindu interests.</p>
<p>After 72 years, the organisation continues to adhere to the external
symbiosis of a Hindu spirit: a saffron flag, an invocation to
<em>Bhãratamãtã</em>, and annual <em>guru-dakshiNã</em> offerings. It describes India
in its anthem as <em>Hindubhoomi</em> (the land of the Hindus) and her people a
<em>Hindu-rãshtrãñgabhûtãh</em> (an embodiment of the Hindu nation).</p>
<p>Secularists of every hue also keep proclaiming the RSS to be a radical
militant Hindu organisation and a majority of the Hindu society appears
to believe so.</p>
<p>But conscious, perceptive Hindus cannot but see that the RSS has proved
a paper-tiger. All its bombastic pronouncements have been ‘sound and
fury signifying nothing’. Whether on Ayodhya or on Kashmir, on Article
30 or Article 370, on infiltration of Bangladeshi Muslims or enactment
of common civil laws, on Sanskrit or Urdu, on <em>Vande Mãtaram</em> or
cow-slaughter - the RSS has always taken a step forward only to take two
steps backwards. Rather, it has made one appropriate noise and then
retreated into its hole. On no issue has the RSS been able so far to
mount a campaign resulting in successful protection of Hindu causes.</p>
<p>India’s Secularist rulers have been relentlessly undermining Hindu
interests, Hindu solidarity and Hindu pride. Their laws, policies and
programmes are invariably meant to help Islam make further <em>inroads</em>
into India. The ground has been systematically eroded from under Hindu
feet without any worthwhile resistance from any Hindu organisation,
including the RSS.</p>
<p>On issue after issue, the RSS starts with a roar, then shrinks into a
whimper, then grovels and finally gives up, defeated but careful to save
its face by inventing excuses.</p>
<p>Dr. Shreerang Godbole has pinpointed the basic cause of this pathetic
failure of the organisation, viz. ideological confusion vis-à-vis Islam.
Lack of a clear ideological vision is the hurdle on which the RSS
flounders again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Hindu Ideological Vision</strong></p>
<p>An organisation - be it the RSS or any other - that really wishes to
lead the Hindu society rather than merely pretending to do so or
politicking to put one of its front organisations into power, must first
develop a clear national vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Hindus are a nation by themselves. India is their homeland.
Sanãtana Dharma is their nationality. It is legitimate for Hindus to
try and establish a polity based on their nationality. It is
legitimate for them to uphold their national culture, assert their
collective rights, regain control of their holy places and
institutions. It is legitimate for them to establish a State that
would give pride of place to their own nationality, its heritage and
its symbols, to the exclusion of all others.</p>
<p>2. Islam is not a religion, but an imperialist political doctrine. It
is certainly not <em>dharma</em>. A true follower of Islam cannot but be
treading a path that Hindu thought would consider <em>adharma</em>. It is a
lethal doctrine that has done much damage to humanity and will surely
do more as long as it survives.</p>
<p>3. It is a wrong nation that the basic tenets of Islam are good or
that bigotry, fanaticism, treachery, brutality etc. are subsequent
accretions to it. It is not correct that Islam preaches or permits any
form of brotherhood with non-believers.</p>
<p>4. Concepts like Zimmi, Kafir and Jihad are basic to Islam and cannot
be changed as long as the creed survives. Muhammad’s doctrine is like
a seamless garment from which not even a single thread can be pulled
out without causing disintegration of the whole.</p>
<p>5. All the evils we see in Islam today - terrorism, mob-violence,
intolerance, fanaticism, disloyalty to motherland etc. - spring
directly out of the Quran and the Hadis. From its very birth, Islam
has rested and grown on these planks. They are sanctified by “Allah’s
words” and The Prophet’s own example. If jihad, kafir-slaughter,
idol-breaking, revenge-killing etc. are discarded, nothing would
remain of Islam.</p>
<p>6. Islam cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as a part
of India’s national heritage or culture. Sanãtana Dharma and Islam are
diametrically opposite views of the universe, divinity and human soul.
The two <em>cannot</em> be fused or harmonised into one or even made to
co-exist peacefully without destroying one or the other.</p>
<p>7. Islam is and shall remain, for the Hindus, an anti-culture. It is
an enemy culture, a parasite culture. It runs directly against
everything that the nationality of the Hindus stands for. Attempts at
glorifying Islam, writing apologetics about it, whitewashing its
crimes, and painting a benign face of it, are misguided follies.</p>
<p>8. A distinction must be made between Muslims and Islam. The two are
not identical. In fact, Islam is the culprit, the Muslims its victims.
Islam holds the Muslims prisoners to a life of hatred, bigotry,
intellectual slavery and unspirituality. It dooms them to a life of
violence, treachery, carnality and obnoxious ritualities.</p>
<p>9. A Muslim’s loyalty to Islam is because of his failure to
appreciate that he is its victim. A Hindu therefore need have no
particular respect for that loyalty. Islam is the disease, Muslim is
the diseased. Islam is the drug, Muslim is the addict. A Muslim’s
fondness for Islam deserves no more consideration than does an
addict’s attachment to his favourite drug.</p>
<p>10. People who are Muslims today have the same innate human goodness
in them as others. But this goodness is muzzled by the malevolent
teachings of Islam. If an individual can be brought out of the
addiction to Islam, he may become a tolerant, harmonious human being
again.</p>
<p>11. It is true that Indian Muslims of today are largely descendants
of Hindu converts. It is also true that the Hindu ancestors of many of
them had belonged to lower castes. But it is not true that lower-caste
Hindus voluntarily converted to Islam on account of oppression by
other Hindus. Almost every conversion was by the choice between the
Quran and death, by arson, rape and plunder, by a hundred legal,
economic and social discriminations, by the burden of jizia, and
oppression of every kind.</p>
<p>12. It was natural that the poorest and weakest sections of Hindu
society succumbed most to this oppression. This explains why a larger
proportion of lowest classes of Hindus (barring exceptions like the
Rajputs) are in the fold of Islam today.</p>
<p>13. We ought not therefore bear any animosity against Muslims of
undivided India (Bhãratavarsha). They are our own people, the progeny
in fact of the weakest segments of our society who could not withstand
Islamic oppression or hold on to their nationality.</p>
<p>14. But these people have been alienated from us, from their
motherland, from their nationality and ancestral culture, all because
of just one evil influence - Islam. If they are rescued from that
influence they can become harmonious members of the family again. It
is our duty to help them know how false and diabolical is the creed of
Muhammad, how it is holding them prisoner, and how it deserves not
their loyalty but their contempt.</p>
<p>15. Prophetic monotheism such as Islam and Christianity has promoted
a world-view that has been hastening mankind to its doom. This
world-view regards God as (creator but) external to universe, Nature
as devoid of any holiness or divinity, the animal and plant world as
mere objects of gratification of man who alone is made ‘after God’s
image’, and the present life to be our only life till the day of Last
Judgement. It has led humanity to an over-exploitative,
non-conservationist materialistic consumerism.</p>
<p>16. The monotheistic notion that only the “faithful” are
God’s/Allah’s/Jehova’s favourite children and that the rest of
humanity is an abomination deserving annihilation, has smeared the
world with hatred, warfare, persecution and bloodshed.</p>
<p>17. To save itself from disharmony with Nature and discord within
human society, the world today needs the catholic vision of the
Sanãtana Dharma, the light of its yogic spirituality, the succour of
its pluralism.</p>
<p>18. History has therefore placed a twin responsibility on the
shoulders of the Hindus - to expose Islam, and to spread the light of
Hindu spirituality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other nation has suffered so much from Islam for so long without
being overwhelmed by it, lost so many of its people to that creed yet
survived in its original nationality. No other nation has such empyrean
spiritual traditions with which to evaluate Islam and study its theology
and practice. No other nation still remains a land of Sanãtana Dharma
yet holds so many Islam-convert descendants in its homeland. If Hindus
don’t spread knowledge about Islam, who would?</p>
<p>No other nation possesses the unique spiritual heritage that Hindus do.
The light of yogic spirituality and quest for Truth are unique gifts of
Hindu rishis to human civilization which we have to give to the world.
This nation has to bring to the world the message of tolerance and
harmony, dharma and spirituality, renunciation and service by spreading
the Sanãtana Dharma. A Hindu who denies himself this role even a hundred
years after Swami Vivekananda and keeps deluding himself by the notion
of a “composite Hindu-Muslim national culture”, is a sadly misguided
soul.</p>
<p><strong>The Sangh Parivar lacks the Vision</strong></p>
<p>The RSS has obviously failed to develop this correct ideological vision.
The anxiety that the top leadership of the Sangh Parivar displays to
“assure Muslims” that “we are not against them”, “to bring Muslims into
its fold”, to “start a dialogue” with Muslim leaders, to secure “a
gesture from Muslims”, to arrive at “an amicable solution acceptable to
Muslims” and so on, leaves little scope for doubt on this score. The RSS
claims to be protector of Hindu interests, but keeps betraying utmost
eagerness to avoid attacking the main threat to these interests, viz.
the tenets of Islamic theology. The BJP leaves no stone unturned to
become “acceptable” to Muslims. Its leaders thank Muslims for their
votes after getting kicked by them on its back. The VHP assures the
Muslims that “we do not demand the return of the thousands of places of
worship that have been forcibly replaced with mosques” and requests them
to “recognize the right of the Hindu society” to only three holy Hindu
sites. Leaders of the Sangh Parivar make every effort, even at the cost
of distorting history, to project Islamic rule as a period of peaceful
coexistence of Muslims with Hindus. “We do not like to think of our
Muslim Compatriots as heirs and followers of such invaders and tyrants,”
says the RSS and wants Muslims to “volutarily hand over” Ayodhya,
Mathura and Kashi to Hindus.</p>
<p>Ceaseless efforts to project a benign face of Islam, glorifying the
so-called Sufi saints,^(<a href="#2">2</a>) going ga-ga over “secular” Muslims
spotted by them, requesting Muslims “to separate religion from
politics”, seeking their “co-operation in modernizing Muslim society”,
finding justification from tenets of Islam in support of Hindu demands
(Quran does not require Muslims to slaughter cows for sacrifice, Namaz
is not permitted on ‘disputed’ sites and so on)^(<a href="#3">3</a>) proves beyond
doubt that the Sangh Parivar lacks clarity of national vision. It has
imbibed enough of the poison of Nehruvian Secularism to believe that no
political movement is legitimate in India unless it enjoys the
approbation of Muslims. Like the Congress since 1916, the RSS has also
mentally accepted the Muslim right of veto on Hindu politics.</p>
<p>Instead of developing the correct historical perception that
Hindu-Muslim conflict is basically a clash between two anti-polar
civilizations, and that Hindus have legitimate national interests to
pursue without bothering about Muslim reaction, the Sangh Parivar has
got into the familiar secularist trap of seeking Muslim support for a
Hindu cause.</p>
<p>The RSS obviously does not realize that this is like fighting a war with
the enemy’s approval. Its predecessor, the Indian National Congress, had
tried this and failed (in spite of the best efforts of no less a man
than Mahatma Gandhi) before 1947, and the Sangh Parivar is equally
doomed to failure.</p>
<p><strong>The Muslim Vote-Bank</strong></p>
<p>Muslims are simply amused when the RSS shows sympathetic concern over
their being vote-banks of the Congress. For, the Muslims know that
vote-banking is the main pillar of their political strength. Ability to
exercise a collective voting power, loosely referred to as a vote-bank,
has given Muslims a political leverage far beyond what is deserved by
their percentage in the population of India. Muslims have been a
political community from the very beginning and are politically and
communally conscious by tradition. This consciousness about what they
perceive as their communal interest is reflected in India through their
voting as a community.</p>
<p>Muslims are 12% of India’s population but command 14-15% of her votes
because, unlike Hindus, they get themselves registered as voters during
revision of electoral rolls not only exhaustively but also excessively
(by duplication of names, exaggeration of age, <em>fictitious</em> additions
etc.). As a proportion of valid votes polled in an election, the Muslim
share is still higher at 16-18% because a much higher percentage of
Muslims exercise their franchise than Hindus. On top of this, they
generally vote collectively according to some definite plan decided in
advance which they trust would serve their communal interests.^(<a href="#4">4</a>)</p>
<p>By contrast, Hindus command over 80% of Indian votes, but are unable to
form a vote-bank because, owing to inadequate political consciousness
and lack of perception of community interests, they are unable to vote
as a community.</p>
<p>The combined effect of these contrasting responses of the two
communities leads to a democratic paradox in India. Elections generally
end in results that accord with the wishes of the 12% Muslims while 85%
Hindus fail to bring about a power - structure that would be favourable
to them.</p>
<p>The existence of a Muslim vote-bank is thus a recognition of their
political strength. Muslims have used their collective voting power to
blackmail political parties (including BJP) into submission and forced
them to toe pro-Islam lines. Far from being used by parties as the RSS
imagines, Muslims have successfully managed to hold political persons
and parties to ransom.</p>
<p>Muslims have never allowed a political party to take them for granted.
Instead, they have dictated terms to parties and their candidates,
dictated national policies and held sway over the course of enactment
and operation of laws in India to “carry on the unfinished agenda” laid
down by the Quran and the Suanah.  Muslim bargaining with their
vote-bank power is simple. Whoever, as a candidate and/or a party, would
commit himself to further Islamic interests in the country - keeping
Kashmir separated from the rest of India, turning a blind eye to
infiltration from Bangladesh, allowing Ulemaic institutions to shelter
ISI agents to carry out espionage and subversion, repealing TADA,
promoting Islamic theology in the name of minority education, promoting
Urdu and suppressing Sanskrit, denouncing the notion of having a uniform
civil code in the country, allowing Islam to retain its hold over
usurped holy sites of Hindus, spreading tentacles across the country
through <em>tabligh</em> and so on - would be assured of bulk Muslim votes and
consequent chances of electoral victory.</p>
<p>The RSS and its front organisation BJP have always been at the receiving
end of the collective voting scourge of the Muslims. They cannot,
therefore, help admitting that Muslim vote-bank functions in India, but
ideological confusion makes them get a reverse image of things. They
keep fancying that vote-banking is a sign of Muslim weakness, that party
interests are served by Muslim vote-banks, and so on.</p>
<p>The acme of Muslim voting power was observed in U.P. in 1993 when they
decided that their primary electoral goal was to counteract the nascent
Hindu solidarity by defeating BJP in as many constituencies as possible,
no matter who the eventual winner was. To achieve this goal, Muslims
voted en bloc tactically in favour of the Congress in some
constituencies and the Mulayam-Kansi combine is some others, depending
on who had a better chance against the BJP.</p>
<p>This tactful exercise of voting prowess led to a stunning outcome suited
to Islamic predilections - the BJP with 34% of the polled votes ended up
with the same member of seats (176) as the Mulayam-Kansi combine which
had got only 28% votes! The ruling power passed into the latter’s
rabidly pro-Islamic hands.</p>
<p>Yet in its simple-minded ebullience, the RSS advises Muslims to stop
being a vote-bank and offers to “treat them as human beings”. It only
provokes derisive Muslim laughter.</p>
<p>Can there be greater self-delusion?  We wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Can all “Religions” lead to God?</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate insight into the contents of sacred Hindu texts have led many
to misunderstand the spirit of catholicity and pluralism embodied in the
Sanãtana Dharma of the Hindus. The RSS seems to be no exception.</p>
<p>It is true that Sanãtana Dharma believes that different paths may lead
to God. Unlike the exclusivist claims of a creed of prophetic
monotheism, which predicts eternal hell-fire for anyone who does not
worship its own god, through its own prophet and according to the
prescriptions of its own book, Hindu Dharma holds that “as rivers
meandering through different courses lead to the same ocean, so humans
following different paths according to their diverse natures, all lead,
O Lord, to thee”.</p>
<p>Hindu Dharma does not therefore brand or denounce all other traditions
and religions as being ‘ways of the Devil’, <em>kufr</em>, heathenism, and so
on.</p>
<p>But a path can lead to God only if it is followed in purity, devotion
and Truth. The God of Hindu Dharma lives in the innermost recesses of
man’s heart and finding God is essentially a matter of attaining
spiritual upliftment which depends not on what he believes but what he
does with his body, mind and consciousness. In Hindu Dharma, a person
finds God by establishing a communion of his soul (<em>ãtman</em>) with the
Supreme Being when yogic spirituality has given him purity of body,
perfect control of mind and a state of super-consciousness through
devoted seeking of Self-Knowledge. Deep meditation or bhakti practised
in perfect devotion and purification of inner self raises the yogi’s
consciousness to its most luminous and intuitive state where his Self
fuses with the Deity.</p>
<p>The Hindu proclamation that “different paths lead to God” certainly does
not mean that any and every crass act can lead to God simply by calling
it “religion”. Sanãtana Dharma makes ample distinction between <em>dharma</em>
and <em>adharma</em>, between spiritual elevation and spiritual degradation. It
is only along a path of <em>dharma</em> that one can achieve spiritual
upliftment. Following a path of <em>adharma</em> of <em>tãmasika vrittis</em> (traits
of darkness) or <em>ãsurî vrittis</em> (demonic traits) can only lead a person
away from the God of Sanãtana Dharma. To suggest that <em>adharma</em> leads to
God as much as <em>dharma</em> would indeed be a negation of the entire Hindu
spiritual thought.</p>
<p>Some aggressive theologies like Islam have gained currency as
“religions”. The secularist argument which RSS appears to have adopted
is: Religion means <em>dharma</em> (in Hindi); Islam is a religion; <em>dharma</em> in
all its forms leads to God; so Islam too must be leading to God.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more superficial or off the mark than this.</p>
<p>The point for the RSS to remember is this. God is a concept. And the
concept is fundamentally different in a natural religion and in a
prophetic monotheism. The God of the latter (i.e. Jehovah or Allah) who
is like a tribal chief protecting his clan and expecting obedience from
them, is endowed with all sorts of human weaknesses, prejudices and
ambitions. He is in a way a finite being living in a particular place
(the paradise), jealous of other gods, and anxious to be worshipped. He
favours those who approach him through a chosen intermediary but
dislikes the rest of mankind and wants them destroyed; he gets angry and
is revengeful, and would decide on the day of last judgement whom to
take in heaven and whom to cast into hell.</p>
<p>This “God” is not the same as the God (<em>paramãtman</em>) of Sanãtana Dharma
who is an all-pervading cosmic intelligence (<em>mahat</em>) constantly
evolving and devolving himself, sometimes manifesting himself in the
form of this universe and sometimes absorbing the universe into himself,
who is beyond time, space and cause-and-effect cycle, who alone is and
who cannot be comprehended except by saying this is not he.^(<a href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p>The God of Sanãtana Dharma cannot be achieved except through perfect
yogic spirituality, through the observance of <em>dharma</em> - in any of its
myriad forms -, but certainly not through <em>adharma</em>.</p>
<p>Prophetic monotheism has no notion of the God of Sanãtana Dharma. The
sole aim of monotheistic theology like Islam is to prepare its adherents
as a community to pursue some material goals in life and to reserve
seats for them in paradise after the eventual doomsday. Even in
paradise, the burden of Islamic theology is that the believer would
enjoy everlasting carnal pleasure with beautiful houris and handsome
youth, eat the finest food and drink the finest wine. However, as Allah
also resides in paradise, the ‘believer’ there would have attained God
in some sense.</p>
<p>Statements like ‘all religions lead to God’ are indeed nothing short of
nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Making Jesus and Muhammad Hindu Gods</strong></p>
<p>The RSS idea of including Jesus and Muhammad in Hindu pantheon to
harmonize the followers of these prophets with Hindus is not just stale.
It runs straight into the face of their exclusivist dogmas and centuries
of history.</p>
<p>Even before Muhammad had fled to Medina, the Quraish of Mecca had
offered to accept Muhammad and his Allah in their pantheon <em>only</em> if he
would agree to retain at least their three main goddesses - Lãt, Manãt
and Uzzã - as Allah’s daughters. Muhammad agreed and soon got a
revelation from Allah sanctioning the compromise. Shortly afterwards,
however, when his strong-arm deputies like Umar threatened to revolt on
the issue, Allah’s messenger repudiated the agreement. He promptly got a
fresh ‘revelation’ in which Allah told him that the three verses
containing the earlier revelation had actually been a handiwork of Satan
in the garb of angel Gabriel!^(<a href="#6">6</a>)</p>
<p>In the face of the exclusionist doctrine of Islam which permits no
deviation from the notion that Allah is the only God, Muhammad is the
only (final) Prophet, Quran is the only Book, which considers nothing to
be a greater sin than ‘adding partners to Allah’ or worshipping idols or
questioning Muhammad’s status, which places destruction of <em>Kufr</em>
(Paganism) in the land of its visitation as the highest goal, it is
juvenile to suggest that accommodating Allah on the pedestal of Hindu
deities could melt the heart of Islam.</p>
<p>The tolerant Hindu society has in fact tried throughout to imagine -
even in the face of terrible evidence to the contrary - that Allah is a
benign god worthy of veneration. Hindu scholars went to the extent of
writing an Allopanishad in the 16th century. Sri Ramakrishna ParamahaMsa
is said by his followers to have taken to Muslim way of worship for a
few days and have had a vision. Mahatma Gandhi kept singing <em>“Ishwar
Allah tere nãm”</em>.^(<a href="#7">7</a>) Temples of so many Hindu sects like Sai
Samaj display the Islamic crescent moon and star on their meditation
spot along with the Hindu <em>aum</em> and the Christian cross. And if pictures
of Allah have not become an object of worship in ordinary Hindu homes,
it is because the pictures would have been surely greeted by murderous
attack, violence and arson by Muslim mobs on the poor worshippers.</p>
<p>All the Hindus initiative to deify Muhammad has, however, had no effect
on the Muslim&rsquo;s spirit of jihad against the kafir.</p>
<p>As for Jesus, he is by and large already included in Hindu pantheon. It
is common in many Hindu homes that a picture of Jesus would share the
<em>pooja</em>-shelf with other Gods and Goddesses. Hindu monastic orders like
Yogada Satsanga Society (of Swami Yogananda) regard Jesus as an avatar
and includes an invocation to him in their daily prayers. The
Ramakrishna Mission accords him a high place and celebrates Christmas.
The birthday of Jesus is an important annual festival in the calenders
of the Divine Life Society and Sathya Sai Ashram as well.</p>
<p>That the simple-minded Hindus have adopted Jesus as an object of worship
without caring to study the Bible or Christological literature or
analysing the realities of his life and creed, is a different matter.
What is relevant in the present context, is that such accommodation has
in no way induced any slackening in the missionary effort at conversions
through propaganda, inducements and fraud of every kind.</p>
<p>It is time for Hindu leaders to realize that the boot is on the other
foot. Making Jesus or Muhammad a Hindu God is unlikely to impress
adherents of their creeds. They would, more probably, view such gestures
as attempts to “defile their faith” or “spoil its purity”. Such naive
expressions of Hindu pluralism would perhaps only make it that much
easier for these aggressive theologies to make further inroads into the
lands of Hindu Dharma and culture and subvert them.</p>
<p><strong>Muslim Attitude to Pagan Ancestry</strong></p>
<p>We find RSS literature overflowing with appeals to Muslims’ good
conscience. “We do not like to think of our Muslim compatriots as heirs
and followers of such invaders and tyrants,” it says. It wants the
Muslim community “to voluntarily make up for the huge massacres, temple
destruction and swordpoint conversions which its earlier generations
inflicted upon Hindu Society”. It says that “Indian Muslims should join
themselves with Rama and not with Babar” and exhorts them “to rise to
the occasion of their own free will”, and so on.</p>
<p>All this indicates a pair of notions: (i) if Muslims of India could
remember that their ancestors were Hindus before conversion to Islam
they would become loyal to Hindu nationality and heritage; (ii) If
Muslims of today are reminded how Muslims of yore (“your ancestors”, in
RSS language) persecuted Hindus, they would be full of remorse, shame
and guilt-conscience and consequently develop a benign attitude towards
Hindus.</p>
<p>Both of these notions are, unfortunately, foolish presumptions born out
of inadequate knowledge of the tenets of Islam, its theology, its
history and the examples set by its prophet in his <em>sunnah</em> (practices).</p>
<p>The basic credo of Islam is that people who followed pre-Islamic Pagan
religions were denizens of darkness (<em>jãhiliya</em>) and only those who
forsake those cultures and surrender to Muhammad’s creed become Allah’s
favourites. They alone are followers of the right path (<em>Dîn</em>) and are
assured of places in paradise. Islam dictates a complete break from the
past. There is no place in Islam for any empathy with one’s
idol-worshipping (<em>mushrik</em>) ancestry. Idolators including Muslims’
ancestors are abominable creatures in the eyes of Allah who has ordained
most terrible punishment for them in eternal hell-fire.</p>
<p>Muslims who kill their own kith and kin for the sake of their “faith”
are in fact glorified in the Quran. Muhammad specially commanded those
of his followers who killed their own senior Pagan relatives, or
expressed willingness to do so, in the Battle of Badr. Abu Talib, the
tolerant Pagan uncle of Muhammad who had made it possible for the latter
to preach his dogma by protecting him throughout from the anger of the
Meccan Quraish, was decreed by Muhammad to land in hell merely because
he chose to remain himself a Pagan till death. According to Muhammad
even his mother Amina had her place reserved in hell because she had
lived and died a Pagan. That the poor woman had died 34 years before
Allah decided to start sending ‘revelations’ to her son and had no
chance of embracing the ‘only true faith’, was of no consequence.</p>
<p>Destroying one’s Pagan past, and establishing Islam on Pagan lands are
the most sacred duties enjoined by the Quran and Sunnah on a follower of
Muhammad.</p>
<p>When a Muslim recalls how Muslims of yore (his ancestors or otherwise)
had slaughtered kafirs, destroyed their temples, broken their deities,
plundered their wealth, burnt their books, violated their women, and
enslaved their children, he gets a sense of pride rather than of shame.
For in doing so, they had acted in true spirit of jihad as per
injunctions of Allah, in accordance with repeated exhortations of the
Quran and examples of the Prophet cited in the Hadis, in short, as good
pious Muslims firm in their faith.</p>
<p>A Muslim would consider these to be acts of valour rather than
atrocities, courage rather than cruelty, virtue rather than vice. For
jihad is the most sacred duty enjoined on the faithful by the Quran, and
jihadic conduct the highest form of piety in Islam.</p>
<p>The RSS has only to note the unconcealed pride and glee with which a
long chain of Muslim historians and ‘holy’ men, including Indian-born
fellows like Amir Khusro, have described the death and destruction
brought upon the Hindus, and how in the Muslim scale of honour, the
gorier the record of his persecution, the higher the place of the
persecutor. Ghaznavi, Timur and Aurangzeb are, therefore, still the
greatest heroes of Muslims.</p>
<p>A vital truth has escaped the notice of the RSS. Muslims of
Bhãratavarsha would start returning to Hindu fold only when they realize
how obnoxious a doctrine Islam is, how false and fraudulent, how
degrading and dehumanising, how unethical and superficial. History has
bestowed a role on the Hindu nation - to help Muslims discover that
Islam is not a religion at all but a political doctrine propounded to
serve one man’s imperialist ambitions, that the Quran embodies nothing
but Muhammad’s own thoughts expressed in words attributed to Allah but
meant to serve his political and (occasionally) carnal ends, that
terrorism and mob-violence have been the stock-in-trade of this doctrine
from the day of its birth, that Islam is a prison-house that deprives
them of their freedom of thought, powers of reasoning and qualms of
conscience.</p>
<p>When, and only when, Muslims find out the reality about Muhammad and his
creed, they would start walking out of Islam and feel proud to return to
their ancestral culture.</p>
<p>It is not whether Muslims know they are descendants of converted Hindus.
It is whether they are proud of that conversion or ashamed of it. Muslim
mind cannot change by the knowledge (say) that they are descendants of
children born of rapes committed by Muslim soldiers on hapless Hindu
women. It would change when they start feeling ashamed of being products
of such a barbaric theology.</p>
<p>Anwar Sheikh, for example, was a typical Muslim in 1947. He even killed
three (Sikh) Hindus in the back-streets of Lahore during the
post-partition riots and felt proud of performing a jihadic act. But
once he saw through Muhammad, his creed, his book and his god (Allah),
Sheikh not only discarded Islam with contempt but is now a committed
scholar producing powerful literature and defiantly fighting the Islamic
thought-police.</p>
<p>Salman Rushdie became what he is and exposed the real character of the
“revelations” in his <em>The Satanic Verses</em> not because he met an RSS man
one morning who told him that his ancestors were Hindu. Rushdie did his
deed because he had realized that the creed of The Apostle of Allah was
a fake.</p>
<p>Taslima Nasreen is not Hindu. But she is no Muslim either. She ceased to
be a Muslim not because she remembered her Hindu ancestry but because
she was intellectually convinced that “the Quran needs to be
re-written”.</p>
<p>No organisation can provide genuine nationalist leadership to Hindus
unless it develops a conviction - and the courage to back it up - that
Islam is the villain and its theology the scourge that has to be put in
its proper place.</p>
<p><strong>Sarva Panth Samãdar?</strong></p>
<p>The RSS has recently launched through one of its front organisations
what it calls the <em>‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’</em>.</p>
<p>Quite clearly, RSS bigwigs somehow felt uncomfortable with the
secularists’ <em>‘sarva dharma samabhãva’</em> slogan but could not quite make
out what was really wrong with the concept and whether they should
discard it outright. So they ended up changing two words in that slogan
and retaining the concept with a slightly modified name!</p>
<p>How is RSS’s slogan any different from the secularists’ slogan? Both of
them mean exactly the same thing. Namely, Sanãtana Dharma (in its myriad
forms and branches) is a religion, Islam and Christianity are also
religions, the latter are therefore as worthy of respect as the former,
Islam and Christianity should be regarded as much a part of our national
heritage as the Sanãtana Dharma, the Rigveda and Bhagvadgita can claim
no more reverence than the Bible or the Quran, Jesus and Muhammad should
get the same veneration from us as Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Buddha,
Mahavir or Nanak, we should regard Islam and Christianity as benign
spiritual traditions like Sanãtana Dharma, and so on.</p>
<p>The bewilderment of the RSS appears to have been caused by their failure
to appreciate the meaning of “dharma” or evaluate the monotheistic
doctrines.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of Hindu spiritual tradition is the
contrasting between <em>dharma</em> and <em>adharma</em>. The Lord incarnates himself
again and again to uphold <em>dharma</em> and destroy <em>adharma</em>; <em>dharma</em> leads
to moksha, <em>adharma</em> to birth in lower orders (<em>yonis</em>), “victory will
be where <em>dharma</em> is”, “a mind enveloped by darkness (<em>tãmasika buddhi</em>)
mistakes <em>adharma</em> for <em>dharma</em>”. If anything can be considered a
blasphemy in terms of Hindu spirituality, it is to equate <em>dharma</em> and
<em>adharma</em>, to suggest that one should adopt <em>dharma-adharma-sambhãva</em>.</p>
<p>But sacred Hindu texts do not leave any room for confusion as to what
constitutes <em>dharma</em> and what its antithesis.  The Bhagvadgita (Ch. 16)
for example describes fully what characterize dharma or <em>daivî-sampad</em>
and what <em>adharma</em> or <em>ãsurî-sampad</em>. Islam which preaches hatred,
violence, aggression and plunder against the non-believers, which lauds
slaughter, cruelty and retribution on grounds of difference in ‘faith’,
which inculcates sectarianism in “God’s chosen people” and contempt for
other humans, which panders to the baser instincts of man to achieve
power and wealth, which provides little for man’s spiritual upliftment -
such a dogma cannot qualify as <em>dharma</em> as perceived in Hindu tradition.
It is out and out <em>adharma</em>.</p>
<p>Putting <em>dharma</em> and <em>adharma</em> on the same pedestal by labelling them
both as “panths” and holding such ‘panths’ in equal respect thus amounts
to adopting a principle of <em>dharma-adharma samabhãva</em>, i.e. equality of
respect for virtue and vice, righteous and unrighteous, good and evil.
This would be ridiculous. It can only make a mockery of 5000 years of
Indian spiritual thought. It cannot but sink the society - as it has
done for the last 50 years - to the lowest depths of viciousness and
moral bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong>Islam, the Source of Ghetto-Mentality</strong></p>
<p>It is foolish to blame the Muslim leadership for the ghetto-mentality of
their community. Muslims have a ghetto-mentality because Islam is a
ghetto. It seeks to close the mind of its adherents against every breath
of fresh air blowing from gardens of spirituality lying outside.</p>
<p>The whole basis of Islam is that Quran is the divinely revealed word of
Allah which is exhaustive, immutable, eternal and universal. Nothing can
be added to or taken away from it. “When Allah and the Prophet have
decided a matter for them, what say can the believers have in it?”, says
the Quran (33:36).</p>
<p>If chemistry, astronomy, geography or bio-genetics prove anything which
is contrary to the Quran (even that the earth moves round the sun),
Islam demands that such knowledge should be shunned. Then there is the
example of the Prophet whose opinion and conduct, whose sayings and
practices on every issue are models for the believers, because he is
considered ‘an ideal man’ sent by Allah. So the best that a Muslim can
ever aspire to become is just another Muhammad with all his cruelty,
causality, clannishness and bigotry.</p>
<p>Finally, Islam’s cardinal principle is that the kafirs are dirty
creatures, objects of Allah’s hatred, whose wisdom is Devil’s mischief,
whose shadow even would pollute a Muslim’s house. This persuades Muslims
to withdraw themselves as far as possible from the learning, values,
philosophies and company of kafirs.</p>
<p>Blocked thus from avenues of science, rationality and logic, adherents
of Islam are reduced to frogs in the well. Suspicious of all outside
influence, fearful of the light of knowledge, they grope in the darkness
of Islam. The predicament of some Muslim leaders is understandable.
Should they continue promoting ghettoes, or risk their necks by
discarding injunctions of the Quran and the Hadis?</p>
<p><strong>Betrayal of the Ayodhya Movement</strong></p>
<p>The ideological muddle of the RSS was starkly exposed by its ambivalent
conduct of the Ayodhya movement.</p>
<p>It started by taking up the emotional nationalist urge of liberating the
holy Hindu site of Ramajanmabhoomi (RJ) from alien occupation and
restoring it to the Hindus. The call found spontaneous emotional
response from Hindus. A clear national vision would have told the RSS
that the Babri mosque had no business to stand on the RJ and its
demolition was a rightful aspiration of the Hindu nation. But the RSS
never developed this conviction. It soon started talking of “making a
new Rama temple on RJ” instead of “liberating” it. It diverted attention
by making bricks, sanctifying them through worship (<em>Rãma-shilã-poojan</em>)
and so on. It avoided facing the basic issue - no temple can be built
unless the original site is liberated and restored to Hindus.</p>
<p>Soon the Sangh Parivar was taking recourse to new subterfuges. They said
that the mosque was not a mosque at all but a temple(!), that they
wanted to ‘renovate’ it and not pull it down, that they wanted to do so
because it was a temple, and that it should be called a “disputed
structure” instead of Babri mosque and such other nonsense.</p>
<p>As time passed, the Sangh Parivar was hedging further. They said they
wanted to build a temple on RJ but only by “amicably shifting” the
mosque. They talked of acquiring the site through legislation, building
a temple without damaging the mosque, ‘relocating’ the mosque with
respect and Muslim co-operation, making construction only on surrounding
land (77 acres) and so on. Stalwarts of the Sangh Parivar were also
giving undertakings in courts and political fora that they would protect
the Babri mosque!</p>
<p>The President of the VHP proclaimed the nonsense that Babar was a
tolerant ruler who did not demolish temples, that it was his general Mir
Baqi who built the Babri mosque without Babar’s knowledge and that
‘offering namaz on a disputed site is forbidden in Islam’. The Sangh
Parivar tried to fool the Muslims, and begged that RJ be handed over by
Muslims as “a gesture of goodwill”.</p>
<p>But the Hindus still went with them.</p>
<p>When the fateful day of 6th December 1992 came, the Sangh Parivar was in
a state of pathetic self-contradiction. The assemblage of Hindu youth
fired with nationalist zeal was not prepared any more to play the RSS
game of merry-go-round on RJ. As they started bringing down the
offending structure, the RSS arrayed its volunteer corps who tried their
best to resist the Hindus and protect the mosque! Luckily, they failed.</p>
<p>As Babar’s mosque was demolished, Hindus rejoiced while RSS stalwarts
sat with sullen faces; Vajpayee cried, <em>‘Satyãnãs kar diyã’</em>, the Sangh
Parivar started hiding its face behind excuses. They disowned the act
and the heroes who had performed it. They frowned at the spontaneous joy
of Uma Bharati and Sadhvi Ritambhara. They all but apologized for it.</p>
<p>And that was the end of the Ayodhya movement. The Sangh Parivar simply
dropped a movement which they had promised would be the greatest mass
movement in human history. While RJ continued to remain in the hands of
anti-Hindu secularists, the Sangh Parivar started bemoaning that the
Rama Temple cannot be built till they capture political power in Delhi.
They meekly agreed to surrender to a secularist judiciary the right to
decide whether the RJ belonged to the Hindus at all.</p>
<p>The midstream jettisoning of the Ayodhya movement has been the most
severe blow to Hindu interests since the Partition. It has demoralized
Hindus, confused them and created doubts in their minds about the
legitimacy of their aspirations. It has left the Hindu society even more
directionless and less self-confident than ever before. It has pushed
the nascent Hindu movement back by almost a century. As the 20th century
comes to a close, the Hindu nation finds itself pushed back to the
position where it had stood almost 90 years ago on the eve of the
partition of Bengal in 1905.</p>
<p>The RSS betrayal of the Hindu society was complete.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Bankruptcy is the Bane of the RSS</strong></p>
<p>Why has the RSS landed itself in such a pathetic hole?</p>
<p>The answer is straightforward - the organisation lacks an intellectual
base. When Dr. Hedgewar laid stress on organisation in 1925, he may have
been right. But his successors got so obsessed with <em>saMgaThana</em>
(organisation) that they totally neglected scholarship and intellect.
They forgot that ideology is the foundation of a political movement and
scholarship and intellect are the bricks that make that foundation.
Freedom of intellect was probably seen as an obstacle in the way of
obedience and discipline (just as in Islam) and therefore detrimental to
organisation.</p>
<p>RSS meetings generally include what they call a <em>bauddhik</em> (an
intellectual discourse) and have <em>bauddhik</em> pramukhs at different levels
to conduct them, but their lectures are generally quite hackneyed,
superficial and uninspiring. More significantly, it is forbidden in the
so-called intellectual sessions to ask questions at the end of the
lectures.^(<a href="#8">8</a>)</p>
<p>Suspicious of liberty of thought, the RSS thus produced a generation of
“uneducated” leadership - people who never cared to read either the
Bible or the Quran and the Hadis or the life of Muhammad or the history
of Islam or of Christianity. Neither did they try to study in depth the
Hindu sacred literature. These leaders knew next to nothing either about
Hinduism or about the prophetic monotheism, about the psyche that has
guided this nation or its enemies, the ethical values that India stood
for and those its invaders sought to impose on her. They lacked insight
into India’s hoary history or the dimensions of her struggle against
invading civilizations.</p>
<p>Hardly anything of notable scholarship has been produced by the RSS
<em>‘bauddhik’</em> brigade. In 25 years of its existence the Deendayal
Research Institute inspired by the Sangh has published hardly anything
that can be called a work of solid Hindu scholarship. Guru Golwalkar’s
<em>Bunch of Thoughts</em> makes critical references to the behaviour-pattern
of present-day Muslims without showing any awareness of what forms their
psyche and what role Islamic theology plays in this.</p>
<p>For the overwhelming majority in the Sangh Parivar, including most of
its bigwigs, the intellectual equipment remains limited to some lay-man
perceptions which are either too superficial to help formulate
ideological convictions, or too much at variance with realities to help
explain emerging events.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Dr. Hedgewar was pursuing his nationalist ideals
during 1925-40, Gandhi’s charisma had widespread appeal to Hindu
sentiments. Majority of Hindu were swept off their feet and began to
share his misguided vision of a composite Hindu-Muslim nationality.
Torrents of contrary evidence were pouring in, but Hindus gullibly
followed Gandhi’s line.</p>
<p>Into the forties, Jawaharlal Nehru was providing an intellectual
clothing to the Gandhian viewpoint. The RSS, suffering from intellectual
impoverishment, was unable to counter the Gandhi-Nehru onslaught or
equip the Hindus to reject its ideas. Instead, the Sangh was sucked into
the thought-stream of a perverted secularism. Since then they have
largely obeyed the secularist track-rules, except for making occasional
noises to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of Ideology is Loss of Way</strong></p>
<p>A part from Hindu society, the main loser from the ideological failure
of the RSS has been the RSS (or the Sangh Parivar ) itself. For all its
boasting about being the largest voluntary organisation in the world
(500,000 swayamsevaks, 40,000 shakhas and all that), the RSS is now
virtually a dead institution unable to force the secularist system to
bend to the Hindu viewpoint on a single issue - from Kashmir to Urdu,
from infiltration to Vande Mãtaram, from uniform civil code to
cow-slaughter, from Mathura-Kashi to TADA. It is like a lifeless monster
of enormous proportions rather than a throbbing little bee with a sting.</p>
<p>In the midst of hundreds of new <em>dals, vahinis, manches, gosthis</em> etc.
floated by the Sangh and thousands of <em>sachivs, pramukhs</em> and
<em>upa-pramukhs</em> and the like nominated therein, an utter lack of inner
strength, conviction and commitment characterizes all its activities.
Having seen the working of the VHP, Bajrang Dal, Vanavasi Kalyan Kendra
and the like from close quarters, I found only a massive form without
any content, a yawning void behind a lofty facade. Programmes are
launched with fanfare, there is hectic activity to get media publicity,
but the office-beares merely go through the motions without any
commitment, and the end-result is zero.</p>
<p>Talk to them in private, and you will know that the cadre of
swayamsevaks is deeply frustrated. Bright idealistic young men who had
<em>sacrificed lucrative</em> material careers and <em>joined</em> the Sangh out of
genuine nationalist urge, feel cheated. What the Sangh is doing fails to
touch their inner chords. Some of them get disillusioned and quit,
others carry on with the rituals and wonder what is it all about.</p>
<p>In the absence of a solid ideological commitment to guide them, many
Sangh office-bearers have been infected by Mandalism and Dalitism during
the last 6 years. With the normal quota of petty jealousies and vested
interests, RSS is making a career for them now.</p>
<p>Look at the <em>shakhas</em> of which RSS brags as running 40,000 across the
country. The unpleasant truth is that, thanks to their unimaginative
functioning, they now evoke little response in the minds of Hindu youth
and not even 4 or 5 swayamsevaks attend an average <em>shakha</em>. Even the
largest <em>shakha</em> in Bihar draws no more than a dozen. But the show goes
on.</p>
<p>In December 1993, my son (18) used to go past an RSS <em>shakha</em> every
morning. He always saw the poor <em>pracharak</em> performing all by himself in
front of his saffron flag. For a few days, an obese Sikh boy was seen
working out with the <em>pracharak</em> obviously because the former’s father
thought the boy should lose some weight. Soon the boy was not to be seen
again. Then came the climax. It was a bitterly cold, foggy morning. The
grass was wet with dew and the sun was not yet up when my son passed by.
He told me sadly what he had seen at the <em>shakha</em>. The saffron flag was
up on the pole. The poor <em>pracharak</em> was again busy doing his usual
drill by himself, while a shaggy street puppy stood there looking up at
the <em>pracharak’s</em> face and vigorously wagging its skimpy tail!</p>
<p>In another local <em>shakha</em>, the <em>prachrak</em> himself told me, some
Mohammedan youths would defecate at night at the point where the saffron
flag was to be erected. The <em>pracharak</em> would just clean the mess in the
morning with a shovel, put up the flag again and start doing his
acrobatics!</p>
<p>Organisations generally reach a stage when the organisation itself
becomes more important than the idea it was supposed to promote. The
vehicle becomes more important than the goal. The RSS too has reached
that stage. Serving the interests of the Sangh Parivar now surely ranks
higher than serving the Hindu nation. A tendency to weave a cocoon
around itself is on the increase. Meet some RSS bigwigs, and you would
find them talking about what happened in the Sangh meeting somewhere,
how a family was drawn to it, how Guruji said what to whom and how
Deorasji responded, how the Sangh Parivar is a well-knit family, and so
on. An unwillingness to face the failures or to objectively discuss
unpleasant realities, cannot be missed. On the contrary, point out the
failures, and pat comes the reply, “Aren’t we alone doing <em>something</em>
for the Hindus? Who else is doing anything at all?”</p>
<p>Constant ambivalence, appeasement of Muslims and repeated
self-contradictions has damaged the credibility of the RSS among
thinking sections of the Hindu public. Specially after the RJ betrayal,
Hindus have lost interest in the Sangh Parivar while the swayamsevaks
have lost inspiration. It is no wonder that all their subsequent
programmes - Swadeshi, <em>Go-rakshã</em>, Mathura-Kashi - have turned out to
be damp squibs. They had started with roars, but all of them have ended
in whimpers.</p>
<p>BJP, the political front of the RSS, has by now been in power for
varying periods in seven north Indian states. There has been nothing in
the policies and actions of any of these Governments to indicate that
they are ideologically different from Nehruvian Secularism. Before they
had come to power, the Delhi BJP made much noise about presence of 3
lakh Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators in the national capital and took
credit for deportation of 127 of them, but once in power the Khurana
Government totally forgot about the whole thing and talked of issuing
green cards to the infiltrators!  In Rajasthan, the Shekhawat government
bestowed a lavish Rs. 6.7 crores on beautifying the <em>dargah</em> of
Muin-ud-din Chishti at Ajmer, which had been built after demolishing
hundreds of Hindu temples. Kalyan Singh in U.P. enhanced the <em>hajj</em>
grant to twice the level at which Mulayam Yadav had kept it and retained
Urdu as an official language. Patwa and Shanta Kumar did nothing that
was even remotely Hindu.</p>
<p>But the cake certainly goes to A.B. Vajapayee’s 13-day Government at the
Centre in 1996. In order to appease pro-Islam elements, it dropped from
its agenda items like scrapping of article 370, building the RJ temple,
removing the discrimination against Hindus inherent in article 30 of the
Constitution, and expelling infiltrators. It did not even appoint a
Commission to study and draft a Uniform Civil Code in pursuance of
repeated specific directions from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>That a party can be so shamelessly devoid of ideological commitment was
a stunning revelation to many.</p>
<p><strong>Failure of the RSS Movement:</strong><br>
<strong>Disaster for the Hindu Nation</strong></p>
<p>For the Hindu nation, failure of the RSS movement has been a veritable
disaster. This Hindu national movement has hardly made any progress
during the last 80 years. It has floundered again and again because its
leaders lacked proper historical perspective and clarity of vision. With
RSS failing to strike a chord in increasing number of Hindu minds, the
nation is left leaderless as well as directionless. As already pointed
out, midstream abandonment of the Ayodhya movement has so demoralized
and confused the Hindu society as to push back its national resurgence
spirit by almost a century. An emerging Hindu consciousness, a feeling
of restlessness among thinking Hindus that was evident in the 1980s, has
suffered a serious setback.</p>
<p>Worse still, only a tiny fraction of the Hindu society has the political
perception to see that the Sangh Parivar is no less steeped in Nehruvian
Secularism than the Congress. The majority continues to place its faith
in the Parivar and feel that its interests are secure - notwithstanding
evidence to the contrary - just as it had done in the Congress during
1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>Secularists of every hue continue to spread the lore that RSS is a
powerful, radical Hindu organisation, and most Hindus keep believing it.
The secularist trick of thus lulling the Hindus into a false sense of
complacency has proved quite successful. Just as Savarkar failed to get
Hindus behind him because of Mahatma Gandhi, so small pockets of wakeful
Hindus are today unable to gather wider support because the public
continues to believe that RSS is there to protect their interests.</p>
<p>The overall Hindu situation remains, consequently, a peculiar amalgam of
frustration and smugness, demoralization and optimism.</p>
<p>Continued Hindu faith in the RSS has forestalled the emergence of a
genuinely Hindu alternative, whereas the Sangh Privar has started
imaging itself as the rightful guardian of the Hindu society and views
the possible emergence of a “competitor” with unease. At the same time,
Hindus continue to be taken for granted and the ground continues to slip
from under their feet, week after week, month after month, year after
year. In the words of the Upanishad, the RSS acts as “people who are
ignorant but imagine themselves as wise and learned”, while the Hindu
society under its care is reduced to “blind men led by the blind”.</p>
<p>With the breath of life almost out of the RSS, decomposition of its body
may take a few years. Where does that leave the Hindu society at the
close of the 20th century is the question to ponder.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p>The writer became well-known when as an IAS officer in Bihar he
protested strongly and loudly against politicians interfering in
administration and bullying the bureaucrats for bending laws in their
favour. Finally, he resigned in utter disgust at the doings of Laloo
Yadav and his gang. His letter of resignation is a classic, particularly
in respect of Indian secularism perverting India’s political parlance.
He has now settled down at Ranchi in Bibar and is actively engaged in
social welfare activities. His book, The Concept of Hindu Nation, was
published by Voice of India in 1995. The Hindi version of this book has
been brought out in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="#1a">¹</a> Shri Aurobindo said in 1923: “I am sorry they are making a
fetish of this Hindu-Muslim unity.  It is no use ignoring facts; some
day the Hindus may have to fight the Muslims and they must prepare for
it.  Hindu-Muslim unity should not mean the subjection of the Hindus.
Every time the mildness of the Hindu has given way. The best solution
would be to allow Hindus to organize themselves and the Hindu-Muslim
unity would take care of itself, it would automatically solve the
problem. Otherwise we are lulled into a false sense of satisfaction that
we have solved a difficult problem when in fact we have only shelved
it.”</p>
<p>While framing the Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math and
Mission, Swami Vivekananda had written in 1897-98: “For whoever goes out
of the Hindu religion is not only lost to us, but also we have in him
one more enemy. It is well-known in history what great harm was done
during the Muslim regime by the renegades who became enemies and
destroyed their own hearth and home” (Ch. Plan of Work for India, Rule
15).</p>
<p><a href="#2a">²</a> It is well-known that most of the Sufis were fanatic Muslims,
they acted as ‘eyes and ears of the Islamic army’, and went places ahead
of the latter and gathered intelligence. They persuaded Muslim rulers to
destroy Hindu shrines and build mosques on them. The most hailed of the
Sufis, Muin-ud-din Chishti had his dargah built after destroying a Shiva
temple atop the Ajmer hill. Another Sufi, Amir Khusro’s gleeful
description of the destruction of the Somanath jyotirliNga, and his
comment that “Hindu women used to rub their vaginas on the lingam”
should tell what stuff these Sufis we made of.</p>
<p><a href="#3a">³</a> The presumptions are not true. The Quran does not exclude cows
from among animals that may be slaughtered for sacrifice, certainly no
‘kafir’ site, temple or no temple, is barred from Muslim take-over. In
fact, Islam believes all land on earth to rightfully belong to Muslims
as per Allah’s desire and a kafir enjoying a land is a squatter anyway.
So there can never be a “disputed” land between Islam and the Kafirs.
Forcibly taking over kafir land, destroying their temples, and erecting
houses of Allah thereon are in fact highly commanded virtuous acts is
Islam.  Prophet Muhammad himself did it at Kaaba and then at scores of
other places in Arabia.</p>
<p><a href="#4a">⁴</a> During preparation of photo-identity cards in T.N. Seshan’s
time as Chief Election Commissioner (1995) it was noticed all over Bihar
that amongst Hindu voters, hardly 45-50% people got themselves
photographed (or their cards made) whereas among Muslims the figure was
above 90%. In any typical polling booth on an election day, Muslim
voters in the queue far exceed their proportion in the voters’ list.
Exit poll would also show that most of them had voted for the same
candidate.</p>
<p><a href="#5a">⁵</a> Even the concept of piety and morality are different in Hindu
Dharma and in Islam. Hindu morality is based on values that have been
evolved over ages by rishis and savants as being helpful for inner
purification and peace, harmony and cohesion in society. Islamic
morality is based on externalities prescribed in the Quran and Hadis. If
they say ‘don’t blow your right nose first’ then it is immoral in Islam
to blow the right nose first. In Islam, piety lies in “faith” in the
Prophet and the Book and conduct towards fellow-believers. In Hindu
Dharma, piety involves spirituality.</p>
<p><a href="#6a">⁶</a> These three verses were thereupon dropped from the Quran and
came to he known as the Satanic Verses.</p>
<p><a href="#7a">⁷</a> Mahatma Gandhi’s support of the Khilafat agitation had taken
the form of putting copies of the Vedas and the Quran on the same throne
taken out in a procession. Muslim theologians were furious over this
‘insult’ to the Book of Allah.</p>
<p><a href="#8a">⁸</a> I know many swayamsevaks who feel quite frustrated by this
prohibition. But the frustration has not found expression earlier than
Dr. Godbole in such cogent form.</p>

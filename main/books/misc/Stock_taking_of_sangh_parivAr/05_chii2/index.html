<p><strong>2. Professor G.C. Asnani</strong></p>
</div>
<p>1. I broadly agree with the stand taken by Dr. Shreerang Godbole.</p>
<p>2. In a labour organisation concerned with purely economic problem, why
bring religion - Sarva Dharma, etc.?</p>
<p>3. We were five student friends studying in Karachi College in the
beginning of 1940’s. One of us started taking interest in the RSS. The
rest of us vehemently opposed him, calling him communalist; we were
nationalists, secularists, congressites. We believed in Mahatma Gandhi’s
approach of love and Hindu-Muslim <em>bhai-bhai</em>. When Mahatma Gandhi
failed in his vow to oppose partition of India, and he succumbed to
Muslim demand for partition, we got shaken and somewhat disillusioned.</p>
<p>4. Then came the question of Hindus staying inside Sindh even after
partition. I was surprised to find that the very Sindhi Congress leaders
who were advising Sindhi Hindus on public platform to stay on in Sindh
after partition, were themselves quietly making preparations for running
out to Bharat, seeking security for themselves and their families,
cheating the poor Sindhi Hindu masses. I questioned one of my leader
friends, “What is it that you are doing? You are advising the gullible
Sindhi Hindus to stay on in Pakistan while you are making preparations
to run out before them?” These leaders had become experts in practising
cheating and hypocrisy; they ran with the hare and hunted with the
hound.</p>
<p>5. Even after <strong>all</strong> such leaders ran out - they actually <strong>flew</strong> out
in aeroplanes - safely to this side of India, they started preaching the
same old thing over again (Hindu-Muslim <em>bhai-bhai</em>) since that was a
very profitable and paying profession on this side of India. They again
opposed those whom they had called communalists before, before
themselves flying out of Sindh, leaving the poor gullible Sindhi Hindus
in the lurch. Then I had some correspondence with one of them, who was
preaching love and love between Hindus and Muslims; I asked him, “Who
invited you to come here to India, leaving Sindh? If you really believe
in what you preach on public platform, then the most honest thing for
you will be to go back to Pakistan and preach your philosophy of love.”</p>
<p>Where do you find consistency between preaching and practice?  Great men
preach, the poor gullible Hindus suffer and suffer.</p>
<p>6. Then I happened to go and live outside India, once for one year in
USA and then continuously for eight years in International University
circles in Africa. I felt intellectually free from the foggy atmosphere
which prevailed in India in respect of <strong>“SECULARISM”</strong>. I found that
practically all the <strong>“SECULAR”</strong> States of Europe including England had
their State religion, which the Head of the State was, by law, obliged
to protect.  In fact, in <strong>England</strong>, not only a non-Christian cannot be
the Head of the State; even amongst Christians, a Roman Catholic cannot
be the Head of the State; the Head has to be an Anglican Christian.
There are laws and privileges for the Church enforced by the State.
Religious minorities have limited freedom to offer their prayers and
worship of God; but they have no special privileges which the religious
majority community does not have.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1982, the House of Representatives in <strong>USA</strong> decided that
the year <strong>1983</strong> should be observed in the United States as the <strong>“Year
of the Bible”</strong> and, accordingly, under his own signature, President
Ronald Reagan of USA made the Declaration to this effect. (See Appendix)</p>
<p>I wondered what hue and cry would be raised in India, by the supporters
of secularism of UK and USA, if the President of India were to declare
any year as the <strong>“Year of the Geeta”</strong>.</p>
<p>Governments of UK and USA know very well that part of the government
money and government concessions in taxes given to the churches goes out
of their countries for the purpose of <strong>conversions to Christianity</strong>.
In other words, these secular governments support their churches to
spread Christianity throughout the world. This is true practically for
all governments of Europe.</p>
<p>Indian secularism is of a very peculiar variety which, perhaps, the
so-called secularists of India do not understand. They have just caught
the English word <strong>“secularism”</strong> without understanding its meaning in
theory and practice and go on parroting this word day and night.</p>
<p>7. A friend of mine sent me a book published in USA. The book was
titled <strong>“The X-Rated Bible”</strong>. It quoted several passages from the
<strong>“Holy Bible”</strong>, which were extremely revolting to my conscience and
sense of Hindu ethics as known to me. I could hardly believe that there
existed a book where God had commanded His followers to batter the heads
of babies in the presence of their parents, to rape the women in the
presence of their husbands, to burn the cities, to capture the virgins
of the conquered towns, and to kill the married women and the first born
male child of every non-believer, etc.; that God was jealous and had
entered into a covenant with his chosen community, ordering it to go and
conquer the whole earth, to subjugate and convert the people of other
religious faiths; that God had made the Church infallible and given it
absolute authority to rule over men and women on this earth and in
heaven perpetually; that the believers and obedient servants of the
Church shall have the divine authority to enjoy this earth and to live
in luxurious paradise eternally after death; and that non-believers were
condemned to perpetual slavery and eternal hell.</p>
<p>Amazed and not believing these quotations, I checked with my copy of the
<strong>“Holy Bible”</strong> and found the statements to be absolutely correct,
printed in black and white in my copy of the <strong>“Holy Bible”</strong> which I
had purchased in Nairobi. I went out and purchased another copy of the
<strong>“Holy Bible”</strong> from the Catholic Book Shop in Pune. It was just the
same.</p>
<p>Even Jesus Christ whom I had always believed to be a preacher of love
and peace had the following words put in his mouth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I came to set the earth on fire…… Do you suppose that I came to
bring peace to the world? No, not peace but division.  From now on a
family of five will be divided, three against two and two against
three. Fathers will be against their sons and sons against their
fathers; mothers will be against their daughters and daughters against
their mothers; mothers-in-law will be against their daughters-in-law
and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law” (Holy Bible, New
Testament, Luke 12. 49-52).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Jesus Christ was advising his believer followers, <strong>“Sell your
coat and buy a sword” (Holy Bible, New Testament, Luke 22.36).</strong></p>
<p>Having verified the quotations, I could now <strong>understand</strong> the history
of the struggle between the Church on one hand and the rulers and
intellectuals of Europe on the other hand about which I had read in the
textbooks of history in my college days. Men of reason and moral sense
could not accept such teachings as rational and ethical.</p>
<p>I could also <strong>understand</strong> why <strong>Communism</strong> had risen in Russia,
altogether prohibiting religion and the Church in USSR. The Communists
had gone to the other extreme, ignoring the basic urge of a human being
to offer prayers and to worship God. Religion cannot be expelled from
the life of a human being.</p>
<p>I also read <strong>“Crux Ansata: An Indictment of the Roman Catholic
Church”</strong> by the noted historian <strong>H.G. Wells</strong>. It reveals the role of
the Church in creating dissensions and wars in the world.</p>
<p>I also read the book <strong>“Why I am not a Christian”</strong> written by the
<strong>Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell</strong>. He was disgusted with the dogmas of
Christianity which had created wars and blockaded the freedom of thought
and belief.</p>
<p>8. I then turned to the study of Islam. Instead of going to second rate
and third rate literature on Islam, I took up the study of the <strong>“Holy
Koran”</strong> and <strong>“The Hadis”</strong>. I was surprised to find almost similar
instructions in the <strong>“Holy Koran”</strong> as in the <strong>“Holy Bible”</strong> in
respect of relationship between <strong>“Believers”</strong> and others. Believers
were given instructions by Allah and the Prophet to rob, to murder and
to burn the habitats of non-believers wherever and whenever they could
find the strength to do so. Allah had also entered into a covenant with
the Believers and Prophet Mohammed, giving them authority to rule over
the earth for all time to come and then enjoy houris in heaven,
authority and obligation to remove all other religions from the surface
of the earth. According to the command of the Holy Prophet, there has to
be a perpetual religious war (<strong>Jihad</strong>) between the Muslims and
non-Muslims, urging the Muslims to convert the non-Muslims through
persuasion, <strong>terrorism</strong> and regular march of the armed forces,
destroying the communities and townships which refuse to yield and get
converted to Islam. The Believers were advised to lay in ambush and
suddenly attack the non-believers unwares when the latter were either in
sleep or at play!</p>
<p>I could now <strong>understand why Mahatma Gandhi failed to resist the
partition of India</strong>. There was a clear and logical connection between
the history of Islam including the partition of India and the teachings
of the Holy Quran and The Hadis. Events were moving with mathematical
precision. Given the startling exhortations of these <strong>“religious”</strong>
teachings, results cannot be different. <strong>There is cold logic, with
cause-and-effect in life.</strong> Only we have to <strong>understand</strong> it. Muslim
violence and terrorism which is on the increase throughout the world at
present, gets its continuous food from the teachings of the Holy Quran
and The Hadis. Why call them fundamentalists? They are just following
the teachings of their scriptures. We need <strong>hard work</strong> and
<strong>capacity</strong> to <strong>understand</strong> the cold logic of the past and current
events of history. Running around and delivering vote-catching speeches
do not help our understanding.</p>
<p>Suspecting that I might be having incorrect translations of the <strong>“Holy
Koran”</strong> and <strong>“The Hadis”</strong>, I referred to different editions of these
scriptures including those edited by noted Muslims scholars and
published by orthodox publishing houses.</p>
<p>I felt certain that I was not reading wrong translations.</p>
<p>I could now <strong>understand</strong> the history of Islam which I had read in
textbooks in my school and college days.</p>
<p>I had seen the extreme aggressiveness of the Muslim community before the
partition of India. I also witnessed their somewhat subdued attitude
immediately after the partition. Soon, their aggressiveness increased.
When I returned to India towards the end of 1982 after an 8-year long
stay outside India, I found the increased aggressiveness of the Muslim
community as in pre-partition days. By this time, the Christian churches
had also become aggressive.</p>
<p>9. Having <strong>studied</strong> the teachings of different religions, I could see
the logic of increasing aggressiveness of the Muslim community and the
churches. I could also see why a number of Hindu politicians were
committing the same mistake of appeasement of aggressive minorities
which was made by Hindu leaders before the partition. The Hindu leaders
had neither the time nor the patience to <strong>study</strong> the basic structures
of the proselytizing religions like Christianity and Islam. I came to
the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(i) Basically, every human being wants to live a life of peace and
happiness, seeking protection of God and worshipping Him for protection
and peace. As such, every human being turns to his religion.</p>
<p>(ii) Every religion has three aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Relationship between a person and God.</p>
<p>(b) Relationship between a person and other persons having the same
religion.</p>
<p>(c) Relationship between a person and persons of other religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Broadly speaking, all religions teach the same thing in respect of
aspect (a) and (b) above, e.g. pray to God, help and love others, help
the persons in difficulties, etc. That is absolutely fine; there can be
no quarrel with it.</p>
<p>However, <strong>in respect of (c), all religions do not teach the same
thing.</strong> Proselytizing religions insist on religious conversion of
persons thus getting them inside their own walls and fences if they are
to receive love and help. They divide the human family into two warring
factions: Believers and non-believers; the latter are despicable persons
and there has always to be a war with them until they are converted.
Hence, the religious institutions of the proselytizing religions
inculcate, in the minds of their followers, a feeling of hatred against
other religions and their followers; they are goaded to be at war with
them, even though outwardly they may speak sweetly. Thus,
inter-religious wars are created by the proselytizing religions, first
in the minds of men, then on public platforms through political
alignments, and finally on battle-grounds.</p>
<p>Policy of conversions is a declaration of war against other religions.</p>
<p><strong>Inter-religious wars between Islam and Christianity are currently
going on in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus, Yugoslavia, Algeria,
Sudan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, the Philippines and
Indonesia.</strong> These wars are inherent in the teachings of these
religions. Even Roman Catholics and Protestants are fighting in
<strong>Ireland. There are no “communal” Hindus in these countries to be
blamed for wars.</strong></p>
<p>10. Hinduism is very different from these proselytizing religions in
respect of aspect (c), i.e. <strong>relationship between a person and persons
of other religions.</strong> Hinduism believes that there is one God but his
manifestations are infinite in number. Devotees of God can worship Him
in infinite number of ways. All forms of worship lead a person to God
provided that the devotee is sincere in his worship and noble in his
conduct. God is limitless and boundless. All boundaries created in the
name of religion between Believers and non-believers and covenants with
God are man-made. The essence of man is divine; the role of religion is
to manifest that divinity which is already in man, irrespective of the
religious community in which a person is born. Like a mother, God
understands the cry of a child, in whichever language the child speaks.
It is not proper for any religion to spread perpetual hatred against
persons of other religions, using the name of God to exterminate other
societies along with their social, religious and political structures.
If they persist in these activities, they are <strong>not religions</strong> but
<strong>aggressive political ideologies.</strong></p>
<p>If proselytizing religions do not give up their narrow-mindedness,
dividing human race into holy Believers and unholy non-believers, they
will land themselves and the whole world into terrible inter-religious
warfare. Here, <strong>Hinduism has a message for the whole world.</strong></p>
<p>All human beings belong to one human family. The merit of a person on
this earth and after death is to be judged by the nobleness of his
conduct and not by the creed he professes and the prophet to whom he
declares his allegiance. Let us all worship God, with a sincere heart,
in whatever form of worship we like. God knows the sincerity of men and
the devotion of his devotees. God is the father, the mother, the
protector of all, irrespective of religion, caste, creed, colour, age,
or sex. This broad-mindedness of Hinduism will ultimately be accepted by
the whole world and every person will learn to live in peace with every
other person as a human being above everything else. Nobleness of
conduct towards one another is a primary thing for peaceful collective
life.</p>
<p>11. It is high time that we Hindus <strong>study</strong> the teachings of various
religions, and learn from facts of history; at least we should read
studies made by eminent scholars of the world. I give below some
quotations from the book, <strong>The Hindu Way of Life</strong>, written by <strong>Prof.
Radhakrishnan, late President of India:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) “From the Rishis, or seers, of the Upanishads down to Tagore and
Gandhi, the Hindu has acknowledged that truth wears vestures of many
colours and speaks in strange tongues” (p. 27).</p>
<p><strong>(ii) “Hinduism is wholly free from the strange obsession of some
faiths that acceptance of a particular religious metaphysic is
necessary for salvation,</strong> and non-acceptance thereof is heinous sin
meriting eternal punishment in hell” (p. 28).</p>
<p><strong>(iii) “Heresy-hunting, the favourite game of many religions, is
singularly absent from Hinduism”</strong> (p. 28).</p>
<p><strong>(iv) “The intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of
blood</strong> across the history of man from the time when first the tribes
of Israel burst into the land of Canaan. The worshippers of the one
<strong>jealous God</strong> are egged on to <strong>aggressive wars against people of
alien cults.</strong> They invoke <strong>divine sanction for the cruelties</strong>
inflicted on the conquered. <strong>The spirit of old Israel is inherited by
Christianity and Islam”</strong> (p. 40).</p>
<p>(v) <strong>“Wars of religion</strong> which are the outcome of fanaticism that
prompts and justifies the extermination of aliens of different creeds
<strong>were practically unknown in Hindu India”</strong> (p. 55).</p>
<p>(vi) “Hinduism insists not on religious conformity but on a
spiritual and ethical outlook in life” (p. 55).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can we brand Prof. Radhakrishnan, late President of India, as a
communal fanatic and ourselves as secular nationalists? What is the
study we have made beyond parrot-like talking of “secularism,
secularism” on public platforms? Have we cared to understand past
history and current events? Do the events of history just occur out of
the blue? We have to base our policies on understanding and reason.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Title 3 - Proclamation 5018 of February 3, 1983</strong><br>
<strong>The President YEAR OF THE BIBLE, 1983</strong><br>
<strong>By the President of the United States of America</strong><br>
<strong>A Proclamation</strong></p>
<p>Of the many influences that have shaped the United States of America
into a distinctive nation and people, none may be said to be more
fundamental and enduring than the Bible.</p>
<p>Deep religious beliefs stemming from the Old and New Testaments of the
Bible inspired many of the early settlers of our country, providing them
with the strength, character, convictions, and faith necessary to
withstand great hardship and danger in this new and rugged land. These
shared beliefs helped forge a sense of common purpose among the widely
dispersed colonies - a sense of community which laid the foundation for
the spirit of nationhood that was to develop in later decades.</p>
<p>The Bible and its teachings helped form the basis for the Founding
Fathers’ abiding belief in the inalienable rights of the individual,
rights which they found implicit in the Bible’s teachings of the
inherent worth and dignity of each individual. This same sense of man
patterned the convictions of those who framed the English system of law
inherited by our own nation, as well as the ideals set forth in the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p>
<p>For centuries the Bible’s emphasis on compassion and love for our
neighbor has inspired institutional and governmental expressions of
benevolent outreach such as private charity, the establishment of
schools and hospitals, and the abolition of slavery.</p>
<p>Many of our greatest national leaders - among them Presidents
Washington, Jackson, Lincoln, and Wilson - have recognized the influence
of the Bible on our country’s development. The plainspoken Andrew
Jackson referred to the Bible as no less than “the rock on which our
Republic rests.” Today our beloved America and, indeed, the world, is
facing a decade of enormous challenge. As a people we may well be tested
as we have seldom, if ever, been tested before. We will need resources
of spirit even more than resources of technology, education, and
armaments. There could be no more fitting moment than now to reflect
with gratitude, humility, and urgency upon the wisdom revealed to us in
the writing that Abraham Lincoln called “the best gift God has ever
given to man… But for it we could not know right from wrong.”</p>
<p>The Congress of the United States, in recognition of the unique
contribution of the Bible in shaping the history and character of this
nation, and so may of its citizens, has by Senate Joint Resolution 165
authorized and requested the President to designate the year 1983 as the
“Year of the Bible.”</p>
<p><strong>Federal Register/Vol. 48, No. 26 /Monday, February 7, 1983</strong></p>
<p><strong>5528</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN,</strong> President of the United States of
America, in recognition of the contributions and influence of the Bible
on our Republic and our people, do hereby proclaim 1983 the Year of the
Bible in the United States. I encourage all citizens, each in his or her
own way, to reexamine and rediscover its priceless and timeless message.</p>
<p><strong>IN WITNESS WHEREOF,</strong> I have hereunto set my hand this third day of
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
seventh.</p>

      <description>PREFACE
It was the summer of 1982. VOICE OF INDIA had hardly started its programme of publications. One fine morning an aged and visibly ailing sannyasi dropped in at my office in New Delhi. He had travelled all the way from some place (I forget the name) in Andhra Pradesh. Someone had given him a copy of my booklet, Hindu Society Under Siege, and having read the chapter, ‘Residue of Christianism’, he had concluded that I was the guy he had been looking for.</description>

      <description>ONE
THE SUNSHINE OF ‘SECULARISM’
Hindus from early seventeenth century Pandits of Tamil Nadu to Arun Shourie in the closing years of the twentieth, have spent no end of ink and breath to demolish the dogma of Christianity and denounce missionary methods. But it has hardly made any difference to the arrogance of Christian theologians and aggressiveness of Christian missionaries. That is because the dogma was never meant for discussion. It is an axiom of logic that that which has not been proved cannot and need not be disproved.</description>

RIFT IN THE LUTE
The Christian missionary orchestra in India after independence has continued to rise from one crescendo to another with the applause of the Nehruvian establishment manned by a brood of self-alienated Hindus spawned by missionary-macaulayite education. The only rift in the lute has been K.M. Panikkar’s Asia and Western Dominance published in 1953, the Report of the Christian Missionary Activities Committee Madhya Pradesh published in 1956, Om Prakash Tyagi’s Bill on Freedom of Religion introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1978, Arun Shourie’s Missionaries in India published in 1994 and the Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill introduced in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, M.</description>

PART I

The Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee was appointed by a Resolution of the Government of Madhya Pradesh No. 318-716-V-Con., dated the 14th of April, 1954 (Appendix I).
2.

CHAPTER I. - MISSIONS IN MADHYA PRADESH AND INDIA
Missionary organisations are so wide-spread in this country that they seem to constitute “a State within the State”. The Roman Catholic Church is a highly centralised organisation, Spread over all the world with power concentrated in the Pope, who, in the words of Pope Leo XIII (in the encyclical letter, dated June 20, 1894) “holds upon this earth the place of God Almighty”.</description>

      <description>PART III
CHAPTER I. – RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN OTHER COUNTRIES
The joint Committee appointed by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and the Foreign Missions Conference of North America in the year 1944, in their “Statement on Religious Liberty”, have defined the term as given below:-
 “Religious Liberty shall be interpreted to include freedom to worship according to conscience and to bring up children in the faith of their parents; freedom for the individual to change his religion; freedom to preach, educate, publish and carry on missionary activities; and freedom to organise with others, and to acquire and hold property, for these purposes”.</description>

      <description>PART IV
CHAPTER I. - CONCLUSIONS (FINDINGS)
On consideration of the material before us we arrive at the following conclusions of fact:-
1. Since the Constitution of India came into force there has been an appreciable increase in the American personnel of the Missionary organisations operating in India. This increase is obviously due to the deliberate policy of the International Missionary Council to send evangelistic teams to areas of special opportunities opened to the Gospel by the Constitutional provision of religions freedom in some of the newly independent nations, equipped with new resources for mass evangelism through the press, film, radio and television.</description>

A non-Christian: Change of religion is objectionable, but it is only sentimental. Allurement of money to innocent people, which may be in the form of help to needy persons, is practised in this area.

1. We have kept no such record as we do not recognize castes.
2. A small rise in the population of our Church is mostly due to natural increase.
3. Out of about 4,000 members in our Church, at present, about 94 per cent are born Christians (i.e., 240 converts).
4. In our churches in the districts of Sagar, Chhindwara, Betul and Baikunthpur tahsil, 154 converts have been admitted into our fold since 1947.</description>

Dear Sirs,
In answer to the questionnaire I wish to submit the following. May I make one or two general comments before doing so. First, it seems to me that the tone, as well as the character, of some questions reflects the attitude that the Christian position is weak and open to suspicion in certain fundamental respects.</description>

From the facts narrated you will please note that the activities of the foreign Christian Missionary are very harmful. The Jabalpur Christians in their resolution appearing in the “Amrit Bazar Patrika”, dated the 27th November 1954, desired the Government to wind up your Enquiry also.</description>

1. According to the Census Report the population was as below:- 1931-5,216, 1941-5,552 and 1951-9,006.
These figures are from census report but they are also not correct. The increase in the Christian population is more than indicated in these census.
2. The reason of rise in Christian population is mainly due to conversion and the fall in the population of scheduled tribe and caste is due to this alone.</description>

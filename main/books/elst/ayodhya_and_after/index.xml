      <description>1. Summary of the historical question 1.1 Before the Masjid, the Mandir The historical starting point of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue is the contention that the Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya was built after the forcible demolition of a Hindu temple on the same spot by Muslim soldiers. In the first part of my book Ram Janmabhoomi vs. Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim conflict,¹ I have dealt extensively with the arguments given pro and contra this contention.</description>

      <description>2. Belief and history 2.1 The belief in Ram The near-certainty that the temple which stood on the Babri Masjid spot was a celebrated Ram temple, does not clinch the issue of whether Ram was actually born on that very spot. We do know that the Hindu culture, even more than most traditional cultures, has shown a tremendous capacity of preserving traditions, poetic compositions as voluminous as the Vedas, and the information contained therein.</description>

      <description>3. Righting the wrongs of history 3.1 The bricks or the truth Advani is the modern Babar, that is how some secularist Hindus (who at least don&amp;rsquo;t deny the historical fact that Babar was a temple-destroyer) comment on Mr. Advani&amp;rsquo;s plan to relocate the disputed structure and build a temple on the spot. With their natural Hindu generosity, they want to keep assuring the non-Hindus that their places of worship are safe in Hindusthan.</description>

      <description>4. Ram Janmabhoomi and the courts 4.1 A non-mosque The juridical debate concerning the Ram Janmabhoomi site centres around two questions :
 Can a court adjudicate in a matter concerning historical wrongs, dating to before the present political set-up, and extending far beyond the case at hand, which has acquired a symbol value in precisely this larger issue of righting historical wrongs? If not, i.e. if the court can only deal with this at its material face value, as a dispute of ownership or of the right of access or use, then whose building is it?</description>

      <description>5. Ram Janmabhoomi politics 5.1 V.P. Singh and Ayodhya The centuries-old struggle over the Babri Masjid - Ram Janmabhoomi came in a critical phase on November 9, 1989, when the first stone of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir was laid, in a grand Shilanyas ceremony. The astrologers who had chosen the time, had clearly picked a very auspicious stellar configuration, for on the very same day, the Berlin wall was broken. Jay Dubashi wrote : &amp;ldquo;While a temple was going up in Ayodhya, a Communist temple was being demolished five thousand miles away in Europe&amp;rdquo; If this is not history, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.</description>

      <description>6. Communalists and their communities 6.1 Hindu Society In many press reports, it has been said that the Ayodhya conflict is a conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. Upon closer inspection, that may not be entirely accurate.
JNU historian Bipan Chandra has often stated that the religious community is really a fictional entity which in people&amp;rsquo;s consciousness only blurs the real-life categories like socio-economical class. The sense of being a member of a religious community such as the Hindus or the Muslims is merely false consciousness, fostered by leaders who want to use the masses for their own social and political ambitions.</description>

      <description>7. Press reporting on Ayodhya 7.1 Reporting on Kar Seva On October 30,1990 thousands of Kar Sevaks moved to the disputed place in Ayodhya. They had somehow sneaked through the impediments which chief minister Mulayam and his security forces had put in their way. In fact, the saga of how the people did it, is the stuff movies are made of. Hiding in jungles, swimming across the river at night, being caught and then escaping from prison to move on to Ayodhya (as firebrand BJP MP Uma Bharati did, making herself unrecognizable), it must have been quite an adventure for the people who did it.</description>

      <description>8. The misuse of history 8.1 Caught in the act of distorting history The Ram Janmabhoomi/Babri Masjid issue has highlighted several more fundamental problems which will have to be dealt with decisively. Perhaps the most important one is the intellectual dishonesty which dominates India&amp;rsquo;s official ideology and its arena of public debate. One area where this dishonesty has been having a free ride during the last several decades, is history-writing. A case in point is the JNU historians&amp;rsquo; statement on Ayodhya, published in November 1989: The Political Abuse of History.</description>

      <description>9. Secularism and India&amp;rsquo;s integrity 9.1 Separatism and anti-Hinduism In the present context, the link between history-writing and actual politics is extra-ordinarily strong. Witness the crucial role of the Aryan invasions theory in the secularist and casteist/Ambedkarist ideologies, as earlier in the missionary and colonial ideologies. In fact, I can not think of any situation in world history where history-writing was so intertwined with both long- term political philosophy and short-term political equations.</description>

      <description>10. Secularism as it is 10.1. Its definition To start with the beginning, Indian secularism was borrowed from Europe. There, secularism meant that society took the freedom to organize itself without caring about the dogmas of the Churches. At the intellectual level, it meant that thinkers took the freedom to independently formulate insights regardless of their conformity with Church teachings. This included the freedom to frontally criticize these Church teachings.</description>

      <description>11. The riots 11.1 Reporting vs. comment &amp;ldquo;The &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; people in this country show a remarkable eagerness to see communalism even in the most harmless observations of [Hindu] religious leaders, while overlooking such outrageously communal and provocative statements as the one made by the former government official Syed Shahabuddin, that contact with the Hindus debased the Muslim, or the one by Syed Abdullah Bukhari, the Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, that the Muslims would resort to a civil war.</description>

      <description>12. Book banning 12.1. Banning all that hurts In the same week when the Kar Seva was due, the speaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, H.K. Srivastava, made a proposal to attack the problem of communal friction at what he apparently considered its roots. He wanted all press writing about the historical origins of temples and mosques to be banned. And it is true : the discussion of the origins of some mosques is fundamental to this whole issue.</description>

      <description>13. Facing the truth the only solution 13.1 Facing the past The chronic disease of communal riots is not going to end by all the talk of secularism and national integration. Some people in Indian politics and in the press seem to think that by repeating the mantra secularism often enough, you will get secularism. But by saying food, food, food your hunger will not be satisfied. Rather, you will starve to death, or get bored to death by this insupportable repetitiveness.</description>

      <description>14. &amp;ldquo;Hindu Fascism&amp;rdquo; 14.1. Hinduism, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s mother? A Contention often heard in secularist circles, is that this Hindu revivalism is a form of Hindu fascism. Specifically, a BJP in power would soon reveal itself to be a Nazi government&amp;ndash; but then it would be too late. I will not bother about quoting all the people who have made such allegations (there are many), and just deal with the substance of this allegation.</description>

      <description>15. The Hindu movement after Ayodhya 15.1 Symbolic issues The Ayodhya issue is a symbolic issue. Non-sympathetic people will say only a symbolic issue. But for people who are part of it, symbols do matter. The Indian Constitution specifically demands respect for the flag and the anthem, even though these are only symbols. So, all due respect for symbols. Nevertheless, a symbol is only a symbol of something. It is this something that makes the symbol into something that matters.</description>

      <description>Appendix 1. Girilal Jain on Hindu Rashtra Girilal Jain is one of the India&amp;rsquo;s leading journalists. He was editor of the Times of India until 1989. After that, he did not really retire, but continues to function as one of India&amp;rsquo;s most respected columnists. In these, he has taken an increasingly bold and outspoken stand in favor of the recognition of India as a Hindu Rashtra, as the political embodiment of Hindu civilization.</description>

      <description>Appendix 2. Ram Swarup on Indian secularism I gladly leave the last world to Ram Swarup. By way of introduction, let me quote the first part of Arun Shourie&amp;rsquo;s article Fomenting reaction, concerning the ban on the Hindi translation of Ram Swarup&amp;rsquo;s book understanding Islam through Hadis:
Ram Swarup, now in his seventies, is a scholar of the first rank. In the 1950&amp;rsquo;s when our intellectuals were singing paeans to Marxism and to Mao in particular, he wrote critiques of communism and of the actual-that is, dismal - performance of communist governments.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am not a Hindu. And I am certainly not a Muslim. So, when I started writing my earlier book Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim Conflict, in the spring of 1990, I was an outsider to this conflict between Hindus and Muslims. But as I ventured deeper into the unique configuration of forces now existing in India, I saw that this was not a conflict between just any two communities.</description>

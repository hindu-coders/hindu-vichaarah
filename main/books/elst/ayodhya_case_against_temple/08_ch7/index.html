  <p><strong>7. Why did Aurangzeb demolish the Kashi Vishvanath temple?</strong></p>
<p>Moghul emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (r.1658-1707) is an icon of Islamic
iconoclasm in India.  His name counts as synonymous with destruction of
Hindu temples, though he also levelled many Hindu human beings.  Yet,
the dominant school of historians would like to salvage Aurangzeb’s
reputation.</p>
<p>Percival Spear, co-author (with Romila Thapar) of the prestigious
<em>Penguin History of India</em>, writes: “Aurangzeb’s supposed intolerance is
little more than a hostile legend based on isolated acts such as the
erection of a mosque on a temple site in Benares.”^(<a href="#1">1</a>) This claim,
warhorse of the “secularist” school of history-rewriting, provides us
with an excellent case study in the ongoing historians’ conflict in
India.</p>
<p>What are the facts?  The official court chronicle, <em>Maasir-i-Alamgiri</em>,
fills many pages with items like this “His majesty proceeded to Chitor
on the 1st of Safar.  Temples to the number of sixty-three were here
demolished.  Abu Tarab, who had been commissioned to effect the
destruction of the idol temples in Amber, reported in person on the 24th
Rajab, that threescore and six of these edifices had been levelled with
the ground.”^(<a href="#2">2</a>) It says in so many words that Aurangzeb “ordered
all provincial governors to destroy all schools and temples of the
Pagans and to make a complete end to all Pagan teachings and
practices”.  Moreover, it records: “Hasan Ali Khan came and said that
172 temples in the area had been destroyed”, etc.  Aurangzeb’s supposed
intolerance can be deduced from his actual policies, known to us through
his own chronicles as well as other sources.</p>
<p>And, to close a loophole favoured by evasive secular apologists when
their whitewash fails, his policies were not a deviation from “true,
tolerant” Islam by an idiosyncratic fanatic, but were seen by his
contemporaries as pure Islam in full swing.  Aurangzeb was a pious man
full of self-discipline and eager to be a just and truly Islamic ruler.
One of his officers wrote a collection of anecdotes, the
<em>Abkam-i-Alamgiry</em>, showing the humane and incorruptible character of
Aurangzeb.  It carries anecdote titles like: “Aurangzeb preaches
humility to an officer”, “ability the only qualification for office”,
or (about a case where a governor had ordered an execution of a man
without the required proof of his guilt) “trials to be held strictly
according to Quranic law”.^(<a href="#3">3</a>) Aurangzeb was a good man and a good
Muslim, and his oppression of Hindus was not due to an evil personal
trait but to his commitment to Islam.</p>
<p>About Benares/Varanasi, we learn from the <em>Maasir-i-Alamgiri</em>:  “News
came to court that in accordance with the Emperor’s command his officers
had demolished the temple of Vishvanath at Banaras”.^(<a href="#4">4</a>) Aurangzeb
did not just build an “isolated” mosque on “a” destroyed temple.  He
ordered all temples destroyed, among them the Kashi Vishvanath, one of
the most sacred places of Hinduism, and had mosques built on a number of
cleared temple sites.  Till today, the old Kashi Vishvanath temple wall
is visible as a part of the walls of the Gyanvapi mosque which Aurangzeb
had built at the site.  All other Hindu sacred places within his reach
equally suffered destruction, with mosques built on them; among them,
Krishna’s birth temple in Mathura and the rebuilt Somnath temple on the
coast of Gujarat.  The number of temples destroyed by Aurangzeb is
counted in 4, if not in 5 figures.</p>
<p>This is how Indian secularists deal with this episode: “Did Muslim
rulers destroy temples?  Some of them certainly did.  Following the
molestation of a local princess by some priests in a temple at Benaras,
Aurangzeb ordered the total destruction of the temple and rebuilt it at
a nearby site.  And this is the only temple he is believed to have
destroyed.”^(<a href="#5">5</a>) This story is now repeated <em>ad nauseam</em>, not only
in the extremist Muslim press (Syed Shahabuddin’s <em>Muslim India</em>, the
Jamaati-Islami’s <em>Radiance</em>) and in the secularist press (e.g. <em>Sunday</em>,
as quoted) but also in academic platforms by “eminent
historians”.^(<a href="#6">6</a>)</p>
<p>JNU historian Prof. K.N. Panikkar offers a more political variation on
the theme that the Kashi Vishyanath temple was destroyed to punish the
temple priests for breaking purely secular laws: “the destruction of the
temple at Banaras also had political motives.  It appears that a nexus
between the sufi rebels and the pandits of the temple existed and it was
primarily to smash this nexus that Aurangzeb ordered action against the
temple.”^(<a href="#7">7</a>) The eminent historian quotes no source for this
strange allegation.  In those days, Pandits avoided to even talk with
Mlecchas, let alone to concoct intrigues with them.^(<a href="#8">8</a>)</p>
<p>The fountainhead of all these rumors about Aurangzeb’s honorable and
non-religious motives in destroying the Kashi Vishvanath temple is
revealed by Marxist historian Gargi Chakravartty who quotes Gandhian
politician B.N. Pande, introducing the quotation as follows: “Much has
been said about Aurangzeb’s demolition order of Vishwanath temple at
Banaras.  But documentary evidence gives a new dimension to the whole
episode:”^(<a href="#9">9</a>)</p>
<p>What follows is the story launched by the late B.N. Pande, working
chairman of the Gandhi Darshan Samiti and former Governor of Orissa:
“The story regarding demolition of Vishvanath temple is that while
Aurangzeb was passing near Varanasi on his way to Bengal, the Hindu
Rajas in his retinue requested that if the halt was made for a day,
their Ranis may go to Varanasi, have a dip in the Ganges and pay their
homage to Lord Vishwanath.  Aurangzeb readily agreed.  Army pickets were
posted on the five mile route to Varanasi.  The Ranis made a journey on
the Palkis.  They took their dip in the Ganges and went to the
Vishwanath temple to pay their homage.  After offering Puja all the
Ranis returned except one, the Maharani of Kutch.  A thorough search was
made of the temple precincts but the Rani was to be found nowhere.  When
Aurangzeb came to know of it, he was very much enraged.  He sent his
senior officers to search for the Rani.  Ultimately, they found that the
statue of Ganesh which was fixed in the wall was a moveable one.  When
the statue was moved, they saw a flight of stairs that led to the
basement.  To their horror, they found the missing Rani dishonored and
crying, deprived of all her ornaments.  The basement was just beneath
Lord Vishwanath’s seat.  The Rajas expressed their vociferous protests.
As the crime was heinous, the Rajas demanded exemplary
action.  Aurangzeb ordered that as the sacred precincts have been
despoiled, Lord Vishvanath may be moved to some other place, the temple
be razed to the ground and the Mahant be arrested and
punished.”^(<a href="#10">10</a>)</p>
<p>The story is very bizarre, to say the least.  First of all, it has
Aurangzeb go to Bengal.  Yet, in all the extant histories of his life
and works, no such journey to Bengal, or even any journey as far east as
Varanasi, is recorded.  Some of his generals were sent on expeditions to
Bengal, but not Aurangzeb himself.  There are fairly complete chronicles
of his doings, day by day; could B.N. Pande or any of his quoters give
the date or even the year of this remarkable episode?  Neither was
Aurangzeb known to surround himself with Hindu courtiers.  And did these
Rajas take their wives along on military expeditions?  Or was it some
holiday picnic?  How could the Mahant kidnap a Rani who was there in the
company of other Ranis, as well as the appropriate courtiers and
bodyguards?  Why did he take such risk?  Why did the “Rajas” wait for
Aurangzeb to take “exemplary action”: did they fear his anger if they
destroyed the temple themselves?  And since when is demolition the
approved method of purifying a defiled temple, an eventuality for which
the Shastras have laid down due ritual procedures?</p>
<p>One question which we can readily answer is, where did B.N. Pande get
this story from?  He himself writes: “Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, in his
famous book <em>The Feathers and the Stones</em>, has narrated this fact based
on documentary evidence.”^(<a href="#11">11</a>) So, let us turn to this book, now
hard to find, to see what the “documentary evidence” is on which this
whole wave of pro-Aurangzeb rumours is based, but which no one has cared
to reproduce or even just specify.^(<a href="#12">12</a>)</p>
<p>Gandhian Congress leader Pattabhi Sitaramayya wrote in his prison diary:
“There is a popular belief that Aurangazeb was a bigot in religion.
This, however, is combated by a certain school.  His bigotry is
illustrated by one or two instances.  The building of a mosque over the
site of the original Kasi Visveswara Temple is one such.  A like mosque
in Mathura is another.  The revival of jazia is a third but of a
different order.  A story is told in extenuation of the first event.  In
the height of his glory, Aurangazeb like any foreign king in a country,
had in his entourage a number of Hindu nobles.  They all set out one day
to see the sacred temple of Benares.  Amongst them was a Ranee of
Cutch.  When the party returned after visiting the Temple, the Ranee of
Cutch was missing.  They searched for her in and out, East, North, West
and South but no trace of her was noticeable.  At last, a more diligent
search revealed a Tah Khana or an underground story of the temple which
to all appearances had only two storys.  When the passage to it was
found barred, they broke open the doors and found inside the pale shadow
of the Ranee bereft of her jewellery.  It turned out that the Mahants
were in the habit of picking out wealthy and be-jewelled pilgrims and in
guiding them to see the temple, decoying them to the underground cellar
and robbing them of their jewellery.  What exactly would have happened
to their life one did not know.  Anyhow in this case, there was no time
for mischief as the search was diligent and prompt.  On discovering the
wickedness of the priests, Aurangazeb declared that such a scene of
robbery could not be the House of God and ordered it to be forthwith
demolished.  And the ruins were left there.  But the Ranee who was thus
saved insisted on a Musjid being built on the ruin and to please her,
one was subsequently built.  That is how a Musjid has come to exist by
the side of the Kasi Visweswar temple which is no temple in the real
sense of the term but a humble cottage in which the marble Siva Linga is
housed.  Nothing is known about the Mathura Temple.  This story of the
Benares Masjid was given in a rare manuscript in Lucknow which was in
the possession of a respected Mulla who had read it in the Ms. and who
though he promised to look it up and give the Ms. to a friend, to whom
he had narrated the story, died without fulfilling his promise.  The
story is little known and the prejudice, we are told, against Aurangazeb
persists.”^(<a href="#13">13</a>)</p>
<p>So, this is where the story comes from: an unnamed friend of an unnamed
acquaintance of Sitaramayya knew of a manuscript, but he took the
details of it with him in his grave.  This hearsay in the third degree
is the “document” on which secularist journalists and historians base
their “evidence” of Aurangzeb’s fair and secularist disposition.  This
is how they go about “exploding the myth” of Islamic iconoclasm.  Their
“debunking” of genuine history as preserved and presented by Hindu
historians stands exposed as sheer bluff.</p>

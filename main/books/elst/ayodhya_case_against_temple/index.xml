      <description>Foreword
The present book is my last contribution to the literature on what is known in India as “communalism”, meaning the conflict between the different religions, principally Hinduism and Islam. Some of the authors whose works were published by Voice of India, notably Prof. Harsh Narain and Sri Suhas Majumdar, had only started speaking out on the communal question in the very last years of their lives. We must be grateful to them that they were willing to sacrifice their years of well-earned rest to a diagnosis of this unpleasant problem.</description>

      <description>1. The Ayodhya debate: focus on the “no temple” evidence
In May 1998, the World Archaeological Congress held a conference on the island of Brac, Croatia, where a session was devoted to the Ayodhya dispute. I had registered to read a paper, and though I couldn’t make it to the conference due to unforeseen family matters, I had prepared the following text.
1.1.Two sides to the story
In references to the question whether there really was a Hindu temple at the Ayodhya site later covered by the Babri Masjid, the focus is invariably on the case made by the Hindu side, viz.</description>

      <description>2. Ashoka and Pushyamitra, iconoclasts?
One of the diversionary tactics employed by the “eminent historians” in order to shield Islamic iconoclasm from the public eye is to allege that Hinduism itself is the guilty religion, viz. of persecuting minority religions such as Buddhism. So much is this accusation now taken for granted, that any attempt to stick to the historical record fills the secularists with exasperation at such Hindu fanatical blindness.</description>

      <description>3. The Bodh Gaya temple controversy
When anti-Hindu lobbies unite, they often manage to get the contemporary form of Indian Buddhism on their side, viz. Ambedkarite neo-Buddhism. Because of its political background, the conversion of Scheduled Caste leader Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and many of his Mahar castemen to Buddhism (1956), in effect contributed to the genesis of what one might call Buddhist communalism.^(1) The anti-Hindu bias of Ambedkarite Buddhism was strengthened by the parallel Buddhist animus against Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka and Burma/Myanmar, as well as by the tendency among Nehruvian intellectuals to construe Buddhism historically as an anti-Hindu revolt.</description>

      <description>4. Harsha of Kashmir, a Hindu iconoclast?
4.1. Claims of Hindu iconoclasm
Whenever the history of the many thousands of temple destructions by Muslims is discussed, the secularists invariably come up with the claim that Hindus have done much the same thing to Buddhists, Jains and Animists. In particular, the disappearance of Buddhism from India is frequently explained as the result of “Brahminical onslaught”. Though extremely widespread by now, this allegation is entirely untrue.</description>

      <description>5. Vandalism sanctified by scripture
(After Hindu activists demolished a mosque in a small town in Rajasthan, the on-line magazine “OutlookIndia” published a comment with an entirely predictable message by the well-known secularist Yoginder Sikand. At the editor’s invitation, I wrote the following rebuttal, published on 31 August 2001.)
In his article “Sanctified Vandalism As A Political Tool” (www.OutLooklndia.com, Aug. 23, 2001), Yoginder Sikand tries to explain away Muslim iconoclasm as marginal and uncharacteristic, all while accusing “the Hindus and others” of just such iconoclasm.</description>

      <description>6. The details about “Hindu iconoclasm”
A remarkable aspect of the Ayodhya debate is the complete lack of active involvement by Western scholars. Their role has been limited to that of loudspeakers for the secularist-cum-Islamist party-line denying that any temple demolition had preceded the construction of the Babri Masjid. Even those who (like Hans Bakker and Peter Van der Veer) had earlier given their innocent support to the historical account, putting the Ayodhya case in the context of systematic Islamic iconoclasm, hurried to fall in line once the secularist campaign of history-rewriting started.</description>

      <title>08 7. Why did Aurangzeb demolish the Kashi Vishvanath temple?</title>

      <description>7. Why did Aurangzeb demolish the Kashi Vishvanath temple?
Moghul emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (r.1658-1707) is an icon of Islamic iconoclasm in India. His name counts as synonymous with destruction of Hindu temples, though he also levelled many Hindu human beings. Yet, the dominant school of historians would like to salvage Aurangzeb’s reputation.
Percival Spear, co-author (with Romila Thapar) of the prestigious Penguin History of India, writes: “Aurangzeb’s supposed intolerance is little more than a hostile legend based on isolated acts such as the erection of a mosque on a temple site in Benares.</description>

      <description>8. From Ayodhya to Nazareth
Indian Cbilstians and their allies in the international media have mostly taken the Muslim side in the Ayodhya dispute. This was the reason for the following open letter to the Church dignitaries, written in the last days of the year 1999, the occasion being the emergence of a vaguely similar problem in Nazareth. Muslims bad illegally started building a mosque next to a church, and the Israeli authorities bad not dared to interfere.</description>

      <description>9. Ayodhya and the Supreme Court
What follows is a reworked version of my paper “The Ayodhya demolition: an evaluation”, contributed to the collective volume: The Ayodhya Reference. Supreme -Court Judgment and Commentaries (Voice of India, Delhi 1995), which also included papers by Swapan Dasgupta, M. Rama Jois, Arun Jaitley and S.P. Gupta. The book was occasioned by the Supreme Court’s decision not to help Narasimha Rao’s Government out of the Ayodhya dilemma by offering an opinion on the historical evidence.</description>

      <description>10. Mohammed Habib’s history-rewriting
It is but rarely that a secularist or a Muslim actually takes issue with what I have written. Mostly they resort to swearwords and the use of institutional power to deny me access to important forums. So, when someone does take the trouble of reading a book of mine and even writing a rebuttal, I will gladly oblige and take my turn to comment on the comment.</description>

      <description>11. The Ayodhya evidence debate
This paper was written as an adaptation from an earlier paper, “The Ayodhya debate”, published in the conference proceedings of the 1991 International Ramayana Conference, which had taken place in my hometown, Leuven.^(1) The present version represents my own text prepared for the October 1995 Annual South Asia Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, U. S.A. A few notes have been added.
The atmosphere at the conference was frankly hostile.</description>

      <description>12. About the Hindu critique of monotheism
This final text was written just recently, after I was given a copy of probably the first book containing a paper devoted specifically to a position taken by Voice of India, viz. its critique of m Monotheism. This was a central theme in the work of the late Ram Swarup and has remained so for those who have learned from him, including Sita Ram Goel and Arun Shourie, the authors specifically studied in the paper under consideration.</description>

      <description>13. Postscript: a lasting solution
13.1. Say it with poetry
It happened a whole decade ago, but the method could still be tried out today. In the dying days of Khalistani terrorism, secularist Prime Minister V.P. Singh visited Panjab and proposed as his solution for terror and separatism this colourful formula: “We must open the treasury of our hearts.” He was indulging in mere poetic sentimentalism to avoid facing the real problem of Khalistani terrorism.</description>

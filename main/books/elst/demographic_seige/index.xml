      <description>The Demographic Siege
BY KEONRAAD ELST
1. Visions of a demographic doomsday
1.1. Hindus, the dying race
 Demography can change the cultural orientation of a country or  region by making an originally small group numerically dominant. Thus, demographic success was a decisive factor in the Christian take-over of the Roman Empire: in the first three centuries, Christian numbers grew by 40% per year, due to conversion and to the rejection of birth control (whether primitive contraception, abortion or infanticide).</description>

      <description>2. Immigration from Bangladesh
 2.1. The uses of migration
 In the demographic competition, simple procreation is not the  only factor. There are cases where Muslims are in a minority and use migration to remedy their minority condition. This does not, of course, mean that all Muslims involved in such migration are conscious soldiers in a demographic offensive (&amp;ldquo;infiltrators&amp;rdquo;), but an element of planning may nonetheless be involved, or may arise in certain activist circles once the political potential of an ongoing migration process becomes apparent.</description>

      <description>3. The Muslim birth rate
3.1. Muslim fertility
 Is there anything demonstrably intentional about this Islamic  demographic expansion? In an article seeking to &amp;ldquo;explode the myth&amp;rdquo; of Muslim demographic aggression, journalists Namita Bhandare, Louise Fernandes and Minu Jain themselves admit that according to official surveys, &amp;ldquo;the disapproval of family planning is highest among Muslims&amp;rdquo;, while &amp;ldquo;the practice of family planning methods in 1980 was lowest amongst Muslims (only 23% of those surveyed practised it as opposed to 36% Hindus)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>4. Islam and birth control
4.1. Islam condoning birth control
 It is routinely assumed in Hindu circles that Islam prohibits  family planning. But against the talk of Muslim &amp;ldquo;demographic aggression&amp;rdquo;, secularists like to emphasize that, unlike Christianity and Judaism, Islam explicitly allows birth control. And this is entirely correct. As Yoginder Sikand argues, &amp;ldquo;Islam is one of the few religions that allow for birth control&amp;rdquo;.[1]
 In the Golden Age of Islam (7th-11th century), various writers  freely wrote instructions for birth control, e.</description>

      <description>5. Hindu response to the demographic challenge
5.1. Some panicky solutions
 This leaves enough time to do something, assuming that &amp;quot;doing  something&amp;rdquo; is in principle possible and desirable. So, what are the options? It hardly makes sense to react to this demographic aggression with a Hindu demographic counter-offensive, as suggested by the Puri Shankaracharya, if at all it were possible to surpass the Muslim community in this respect.[1] A similar idea is that birth control should be made compulsory for all, e.</description>

      <description>Appendix (1998, but not included in the book The Demographic Siege):
Using Kafir women in the service of Muslim demography
 One of the most painful aspects of Muslim demographic warfare is  the open attempt by Muslims to grab non-Muslim girls to use them for their own demographic ambitions, meanwhile also inflicting a good dose of humiliation on the accursed kafirs. In Bangladesh and in Muslim-majority areas inside India, this often takes the form of simply kidnapping girls, or of threatening their families to marry them out to Muslims.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION
This book will deal with items of faith central to the Christian tradition. It may therefore be in order to clarify where I stand vis-a-vis this tradition. For most practical purposes, I belong to the Catholic community in my country: schooling, membership of cultural organizations, trade-union etc. I confess (therewith upholding a Christian ritual) that several times, I have voted for the Christian-Democratic Party, a non-confessional party that vaguely adheres to “values” upheld by the Christian tradition.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER ONE
BRINGING SCRIPTURE DOWN TO EARTH
1.1. Vanishing of the supernatural
Anyone who cares to look, can see that Christianity is in steep decline. This is especially the case in Europe, where church attendance levels in many countries have fallen below 10% or even below 5%. In most Christian countries (i.e. with the exception of some frontier areas of the missions), the trend is the same, even if less dramatic.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWO
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PROPHETISM
The main part of this book is intended as an introduction to important findings in Bible research from the angle of psychology, with the emphasis on the work of the Flemish Bible scholar and psychologist Dr. Somers (parts of chapters 3.6 to 3.10 are little more than a re-wording of his original writings).
2.1. A Jesuit breaks free
Dr. Herman H. Somers, born in Antwerp on 3 October 1921, is an accomplished scholar with acclaimed contributions in many fields of learning.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THREE
PSYCHOLOGY OF JESUS
3.1. Nietzsche on Jesus
The first to take on Jesus as a psychologist, though not as a medically trained psychopathologist, was the German scholar and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the greatest critics of Christianity (who ended up suffering an irreversible mental breakdown himself).^(1) Like many Christians, he thought that the historical Christ was a very different man from the Christ of theology. Thus, Christ had renounced the law and chosen a life of childlike innocence, whereas the Churches had built an elaborate system of morality on top of his teachings.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FOUR
REACTIONS TO PSYCHO-CHRISTOLOGY
4.1. Catholic reactions
In Flanders, the Catholic-dominated press has kept very quiet about Dr. Somers’ approach to Jesus. Most theologians have kept mum. The Vatican has not reacted. It had put some Jesuits to work on this theory, but they did not publicly speak out. Perhaps they are aware of its explosive potential. Perhaps they are, on the contrary, not worried at all, because earlier psychopathological studies about Jesus had also not toppled Christianity.</description>

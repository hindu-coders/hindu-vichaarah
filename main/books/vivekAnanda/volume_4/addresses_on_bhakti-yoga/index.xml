      <description>THE PREPARATION The best definition given of Bhakti-Yoga is perhaps embodied in the verse: &amp;ldquo;May that love undying which the non-discriminating have for the fleeting objects of the senses never leave this heart of mine — of me who seek after Thee!&amp;rdquo; We see what a strong love men, who do not know any better, have for sense-objects, for money, dress, their wives, children, friends, and possessions. What a tremendous clinging they have to all these things!</description>

      <description>THE FIRST STEPS The philosophers who wrote on Bhakti defined it as extreme love for God. Why a man should love God is the question to be solved; and until we understand that, we shall not be able to grasp the subject at all. There are two entirely different ideals of life. A man of any country who has any religion knows that he is a body and a spirit also.</description>

      <title>173 THE TEACHER OF SPIRITUALITY</title>

      <description>THE TEACHER OF SPIRITUALITY Every soul is destined to be perfect, and every being, in the end, will attain to that state. Whatever we are now is the result of whatever we have been or thought in the past; and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we do or think now. But this does not preclude our receiving help from outside; the possibilities of the soul are always quickened by some help from outside, so much so that in the vast majority of cases in the world, help from outside is almost absolutely necessary.</description>

      <title>174 THE NEED OF SYMBOLS</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_4/addresses_on_bhakti-yoga/174_the_need_of_symbols/</link>

      <description>THE NEED OF SYMBOLS Bhakti is divided into two portions. One is called Vaidhi, formal or ceremonial; the other portion is called Mukhyā, supreme. The word Bhakti covers all the ground between the lowest form of worship and the highest form of life. All the worship that you have seen in any country in the world, or in any religion, is regulated by love. There is a good deal that is simple ceremony; there is also a good deal which, though not ceremony, is still not love, but a lower state.</description>

      <title>175 THE CHIEF SYMBOLS</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_4/addresses_on_bhakti-yoga/175_the_chief_symbols/</link>

      <description>THE CHIEF SYMBOLS There are two Sanskrit words, Pratika and Pratimā. Pratika means coming towards, nearing. In all countries you find various grades of worship. In this country, for instance, there are people who worship images of saints, there are people who worship certain forms and symbols. Then there are people who worship different beings who are higher than men, and their number is increasing very rapidly — worshippers of departed spirits.</description>

      <title>176 THE ISHTA</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_4/addresses_on_bhakti-yoga/176_the_ishta/</link>

      <description>THE ISHTA The theory of Ishta, which I briefly referred to before, is a subject requiring careful attention because with a proper understanding of this, all the various religions of the world can be understood. The word Ishta is derived from the root Ish, to desire, choose. The ideal of all religions, all sects, is the same — the attaining of liberty and cessation of misery. Wherever you find religion, you find this ideal working in one form or other.</description>

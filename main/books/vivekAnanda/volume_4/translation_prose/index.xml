      <description>THE PROBLEM OF MODERN INDIA AND ITS SOLUTION (The above is a translation of the first Bengali article written by Swami Vivekananda as an introduction to the Udbodhana, when it was started on the 14th of January, 1899, as the Bengali fortnightly (afterwards monthly) journal of the Ramakrishna Order.)
The ancient history of India is full of descriptions of the gigantic energies and their multifarious workings, the boundless spirit, the combination of indomitable action and reaction of the various forces, and, above all, the profound thoughtfulness of a godly race.</description>

      <description>RAMAKRISHNA: HIS LIFE AND SAYINGS (Translation of a review of Ramakrishna: His Life and Sayings by Prof. Max Müller, contributed to the Udbodhana, 14th March, 1899.)
Among the Sanskrit scholars of the West, Professor Max Müller takes the lead. The Rig-Veda Samhitā, the whole of which no one could even get at before, is now very neatly printed and made accessible to the public, thanks to the munificent generosity of the East India Company and to the Professor&amp;rsquo;s prodigious labours extending over years.</description>

      <description>THE PARIS CONGRESS OF THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS (Translated from Bengali from a Paris letter written to the Udbodhana.)
In the Paris Exhibition, the Congress of the History of Religions recently sat for several days together. At the Congress, there was no room allowed for the discussions on the doctrines and spiritual views of any religion; its purpose was only to inquire into the historic evolution of the different forms of established faiths, and along with it other accompanying facts that are incidental to it.</description>

      <description>KNOWLEDGE: ITS SOURCE AND ACQUIREMENT (Translated from a Bengali contribution by Swami Vivekananda to the Udbodhana, 12th February, 1899.)
Various have been the theories propounded as regards the primitive source of knowledge. We read in the Upanishads that Brahmā, who was the first and the foremost among the Devas, held the key to all knowledge, which he revealed to his disciples and which, being handed down in succession, has been bequeathed as a legacy to the subsequent age.</description>

      <description>MODERN INDIA (Translated from a Bengali contribution to the Udbodhana, March 1899)
The Vedic priests base their superior strength on the knowledge of the sacrificial Mantras. (Vedic hymns uttered by the priests to invoke the Devas at the time of sacrifice.) By the power of these Mantras, the Devas are made to come down from their heavenly abodes, accept the drink and food offerings, and grant the prayers of the Yajamānas.</description>

      <description>THE EDUCATION THAT INDIA NEEDS (Written to Shrimati Saralā Ghosal, B.A., Editor, Bhārati, from Darjeeling, 24th April, 1897. (Translated from Bengali .)
In reply to your questions about the methods of work, the most important thing I have to say is that the work should be started on a scale which would be commensurate with the results desired. I have heard much of your liberal mind, patriotism, and steady perseverance from my friend Miss Müller; and the proof of your erudition is evident.</description>

OUR PRESENT SOCIAL PROBLEMS (Translated from a Bengali letter written to Shrimati Mrinalini Bose from Deoghar (Vaidyanāth), on 23rd December, 1898.)
स ईशोऽनिर्वचनीयप्रेमस्वरूपः — &amp;ldquo;The Lord whose nature is unspeakable love.&amp;rdquo; That this characteristic of God mentioned by Nārada is manifest and admitted on all hands is the firm conviction of my life. The aggregate of many individuals is called Samashti (the whole), and each individual is called Vyashti (a part).</description>

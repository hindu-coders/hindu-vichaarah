      <description>IS THE SOUL IMMORTAL? (The Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the discussion of this question, carried on in the pages of The New York Morning Advertiser.)
&amp;ldquo;None has power to destroy the unchangeable.&amp;quot; — Bhagavad-Gitā.
In the great Sanskrit epic, the Mahābhārata, the story is told how the hero, Yudhishthira, when asked by Dharma to tell what was the most wonderful thing in the world, replied, that it was the persistent belief of man kind in their own deathlessness in spite of their witnessing death everywhere around them almost every moment of their lives.</description>

      <description>REINCARNATION (Contributed to the Metaphysical Magazine, New York, March, 1895)
&amp;ldquo;Both you and I have passed through many births; you know them not, I know them all.&amp;quot; — Bhagavad-Gitā
Of the many riddles that have perplexed the intellect of man in all climes and times, the most intricate is himself. Of the myriad mysteries that have called forth his energies to struggle for solution from the very dawn of history, the most mysterious is his own nature.</description>

      <description>ON DR. PAUL DEUSSEN (Written for the Brahmavādin, 1896.)
More than a decade has passed since a young German student, one of eight children of a not very well-to-do clergyman, heard on a certain day Professor Lassen lecturing on a language and literature new — very new even at that time — to European scholars, namely, Sanskrit. The lectures were of course free; for even now it is impossible for any one in any European University to make a living by teaching Sanskrit, unless indeed the University backs him.</description>

      <description>ON PROFESSOR MAX MÜLLER (Written for the Brahmāvadin, from London, June 6, 1896.)
Though the ideal of work of our Brahmavādin should always be &amp;ldquo;कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन — To work thou hast the right, but never to the fruits thereof&amp;rdquo;, yet no sincere worker passes out of the field of activity without making himself known and catching at least a few rays of light.
The beginning of our work has been splendid, and the steady earnestness shown by our friends is beyond all praise.</description>

      <description>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF PAVHARI BABA To help the suffering world was the gigantic task to which the Buddha gave prominence, brushing aside for the time being almost all other phases of religion; yet he had to spend years in self-searching to realise the great truth of the utter hollowness of clinging to a selfish individuality. A more unselfish and untiring worker is beyond our most sanguine imagination: yet who had harder struggles to realise the meaning of things than he?</description>

      <description>ARYANS AND TAMILIANS A veritable ethnological museum! Possibly, the half-ape skeleton of the recently discovered Sumatra link will be found on search here, too. The Dolmens are not wanting. Flint implements can be dug out almost anywhere. The lake-dwellers — at least the river-dwellers — must have been abundant at one time. The cave-men and leaf-wearers still persist. The primitive hunters living in forests are in evidence in various parts of the country.</description>

      <description>THE SOCIAL CONFERENCE ADDRESS &amp;ldquo;God created the native, God created the European, but somebody else created the mixed breed&amp;rdquo; — we heard a horribly blasphemous Englishman say.
Before us lies the inaugural address of Mr. Justice Ranade, voicing the reformatory zeal of the Indian Social Conference. In it there is a huge array of instances of inter-caste marriages of yore, a good leaf about the liberal spirit of the ancient Kshatriyas, good sober advice to students, all expressed with an earnestness of goodwill and gentleness of language that is truly admirable.</description>

      <description>INDIA&amp;rsquo;S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD The following notes were discovered among Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s papers. He intended to write a book and jotted down forty-two points as a syllabus for the work, but only a few points were dealt with as an introduction by him and the work was left unfinished. We give the manuscript as found.
SYLLABUS
1. Bold has been my message to the people of the West. Bolder to those at home.</description>

      <description>STRAY REMARKS ON THEOSOPHY (Found among Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s papers.)
The Theosophists are having a jubilee time of it this year, and several press-notices are before us of their goings and doings for the last twenty-five years.
Nobody has a right now to say that the Hindus are not liberal to a fault. A coterie of young Hindus has been found to welcome even this graft of American Spiritualism, with its panoply of taps and raps and hitting back and forth with Mahātmic pellets.</description>

REPLY TO THE ADDRESS OF THE MAHARAJA OF KHETRI INDIA — THE LAND OF RELIGION
During the residence of the Swamiji in America, the following Address from the Maharaja of Khetri (Rajputana), dated March 4th, 1895, was received by him:
My dear Swamiji,
As the head of this Durbar (a formal stately assemblage) held today for this special purpose, I have much pleasure in conveying to you, in my own name and that of my subjects, the heartfelt thanks of this State for your worthy representation of Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions, held at Chicago, in America.</description>

      <description>REPLY TO THE MADRAS ADDRESS (When the success of the Swami in America became well known in India, several meetings were held and addresses of thanks and congratulations were forwarded to him. The first reply which he wrote was that to the Address of the Hindus of Madras.)
FRIENDS, FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN AND CO-RELIGIONISTS OF MADRAS,
It is most gratifying to me to find that my insignificant service to the cause of our religion has been acceptable to you, not because it is as a personal appreciation of me and my work in a foreign and distant land, but as a sure sign that, though whirlwind after whirlwind of foreign invasion has passed over the devoted head of India, though centuries of neglect on our part and contempt on the part of our conquerors have visibly dimmed the glories of ancient Âryāvarta, though many a stately column on which it rested, many a beautiful arch, and many a marvellous corner have been washed away by the inundations that deluged the land for centuries — the centre is all sound, the keystone is unimpaired.</description>

A MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY TO A FRIEND (Written from Bombay on 23rd May, 1893 to D. R. Balaji Rao who just had a severe domestic affliction.)
&amp;ldquo;Naked came I out of my mother&amp;rsquo;s womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&amp;rdquo; Thus said the old Jewish saint when suffering the greatest calamities that could befall man, and he erred not.</description>

      <description>Addressee »
WHAT WE BELIEVE IN (Written to &amp;ldquo;Kidi&amp;rdquo; on March 3, 1894, from Chicago.)
I agree with you so far that faith is a wonderful insight and that it alone can save; but there is the danger in it of breeding fanaticism and barring further progress.
Jnāna is all right; but there is the danger of its becoming dry intellectualism. Love is great and noble; but it may die away in meaningless sentimentalism.</description>

      <description>OUR DUTY TO THE MASSES (Written from Chicago to H. H. the Maharaja of Mysore on June 23, 1894.)
Shri Nārāyana bless you and yours. Through your Highness&amp;rsquo; kind help it has been possible for me to come to this country. Since then I have become well known here, and the hospitable people of this country have supplied all my wants. It is a wonderful country, and this is a wonderful nation in many respects.</description>

      <description>TO MY BRAVE BOYS (Written to Alasinga Perumal from New York on 19th November, 1894.)
Push on with the organization. Nothing else is necessary but these — love, sincerity, and patience. What is life but growth, i.e. expansion, i.e. love? Therefore all love is life, it is the only law of life; all selfishness is death, and this is true here or hereafter. It is life to do good, it is death not to do good to others.</description>

It is with a heart full of love, gratitude, and trust that I take up my pen to write to you. Let me tell you first, that you are one of the few men that I have met in my life who are thorough in their convictions. You have a whole-souled possession of a wonderful combination of feeling and knowledge, and withal a practical ability to bring ideas into realised forms.</description>

      <description>FUNDAMENTALS OF RELIGION (This incomplete article was found in the papers of Miss S. E. Waldo. The heading is inserted by us — Publisher.)
My mind can best grasp the religions of the world, ancient or modern, dead or living, through this fourfold division:
1. Symbology — The employment of various external aids to preserve and develop the religious faculty of man.
2. History — The philosophy of each religion as illustrated in the lives of divine or human teachers acknowledged by each religion.</description>

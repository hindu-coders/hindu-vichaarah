      <description>MIRACLES (The Memphis Commercial, 15th January, 1894)
Asked by the reporter for his impressions of America, he said:
&amp;ldquo;I have a good impression of this country especially of the American women. I have especially remarked on the absence of poverty in America.&amp;rdquo;
The conversation afterward turned to the subject of religions. Swami Vive Kananda expressed the opinion that the World&amp;rsquo;s Parliament of Religions had been beneficial in that it had done much toward broadening ideas.</description>

      <description>AN INDIAN YOGI IN LONDON (The Westminster Gazette, 23rd October, 1895)
Indian philosophy has in recent years had a deep and growing fascination for many minds, though up to the present time its exponents in this country have been entirely Western in their thought and training, with the result that very little is really known of the deeper mysteries of the Vedanta wisdom, and that little only by a select few.</description>

      <description>INDIA&amp;rsquo;S MISSION (Sunday Times, London, 1896)
English people are well acquainted with the fact that they send missionaries to India&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coral strands&amp;rdquo;. Indeed, so thoroughly do they obey the behest, &amp;ldquo;Go ye forth into all the world and preach the Gospel&amp;rdquo;, that none of the chief British sects are behindhand in obedience to the call to spread Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching. People are not so well aware that India also sends missionaries to England.</description>

      <description>INDIA AND ENGLAND (India, London, 1896)
During the London season, Swami Vivekananda has been teaching and lecturing to considerable numbers of people who have been attracted by his doctrine and philosophy. Most English people fancy that England has the practical monopoly of missionary enterprise, almost unbroken save for a small effort on the part of France. I therefore sought the Swami in his temporary home in South Belgravia to enquire what message India could possibly send to England, apart from the remonstrances she has too often had to make on the subject of home charges, judicial and executive functions combined in one person, the settlement of expenses connected with Sudanese and other expeditions.</description>

      <description>INDIAN MISSIONARY&amp;rsquo;S MISSION TO ENGLAND (The Echo, London, 1896)
. . . I presume that in his own country the Swami would live under a tree, or at most in the precincts of a temple, his head shaved, dressed in the costume of his country. But these things are not done in London, so that I found the Swami located much like other people, and, save that he wears a long coat of a dark orange shade, dressed like other mortals likewise.</description>

      <description>WITH THE SWAMI VIVEKANANDA AT MADURA (The Hindu, Madras, February, 1897)
Q. — The theory that the universe is false seems to be understood in the following senses: (a) the sense in which the duration of perishing forms and names is infinitesimally small with reference to eternity; (b) the sense in which the period between any two Pralayas (involution of the universe) is infinitesimally small with reference to eternity; (c) the sense in which the universe is ultimately false though it has an apparent reality at present, depending upon one sort of consciousness, in the same way as the idea of silver superimposed on a shell or that of a serpent on a rope, is true for the time being, and, in effect, is dependent upon a particular condition of mind; (d) the sense in which the universe is a phantom just like the son of a barren woman or like the horns of a hare.</description>

      <description>THE ABROAD AND THE PROBLEMS AT HOME (The Hindu, Madras, February, 1897)
Our representative met the Swami Vivekananda in the train at the Chingleput Station and travelled with him to Madras. The following is the report of the interview:
&amp;ldquo;What made you go to America, Swamiji?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Rather a serious question to answer in brief. I can only answer it partly now. Because I travelled all over India, I wanted to go over to other countries.</description>

      <description>THE MISSIONARY WORK OF THE FIRST HINDU SANNYASIN TO THE WEST AND HIS PLAN OF REGENERATION OF INDIA (Madras Times, February, 1897)
For the past few weeks, the Hindu public of Madras have been most eagerly expecting the arrival of Swami Vivekananda, the great Hindu monk of world-wide fame. At the present moment his name is on everybody&amp;rsquo;s lips. In the school, in the college, in the High Court, on the marina, and in the streets and bazars of Madras, hundreds of inquisitive spirits may be seen asking when the Swami will be coming.</description>

      <description>REAWAKENING OF HINDUISM ON A NATIONAL BASIS (Prabuddha Bharata, September, 1898)
In an interview which a representative of Prabuddha Bharata had recently with the Swami Vivekananda, that great Teacher was asked: &amp;ldquo;What do you consider the distinguishing feature of your movement, Swamiji?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Aggression,&amp;rdquo; said the Swami promptly, &amp;ldquo;aggression in a religious sense only. Other sects and parties have carried spirituality all over India, but since the days of Buddha we have been the first to break bounds and try to flood the world with missionary zeal.</description>

      <description>ON INDIAN WOMEN — THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE (Prabuddha Bharata, December, 1898)
It was early one Sunday morning, writes our representative, in a beautiful Himalayan valley, that I was at last able to carry out the order of the Editor, and call on the Swami Vivekananda, to ascertain something of his views on the position and prospects of Indian Women.
&amp;ldquo;Let us go for a walk&amp;rdquo;, said the Swami, when I had announced my errand, and we set out at once amongst some of the most lovely scenery in the world.</description>

      <description>ON THE BOUNDS OF HINDUISM (Prabuddha Bharata, April, 1899)
Having been directed by the Editor, writes our representative, to interview Swami Vivekananda on the question of converts to Hinduism, I found an opportunity one evening on the roof of a Ganga houseboat. It was after nightfall, and we had stopped at the embankment of the Ramakrishna Math, and there the Swami came down to speak with me.
Time and place were alike delightful.</description>

      <description>NOTE Before leaving for the U.S.A. Swamiji used to change his name very often. In earlier years, he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the readers, these volumes use the more familiar name of Vivekananda.

      <description>I (Translated from Bengali )
ALLAHABAD
5th January, 1890.
MY DEAR FAKIR, (Shri Yajneshwar Bhattacharya)
. . . A word for you. Remember always, I may not see you again. Be moral. Be brave. Be a heart-whole man. Strictly moral, brave unto desperation. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother your head with religious theories. Cowards only sin, brave men never, no, not even in mind. Try to love anybody and everybody. Be a man and try to make those immediately under your care, namely Ram, Krishnamayi, and Indu, brave, moral, and sympathising.</description>

20th September, 1892.
DEAR PANDITJI MAHÂRÂJ, (Pandit Shankarlal of Khetri.)
Your letter has reached me duly. I do not know why I should be undeservingly praised. &amp;ldquo;None is good, save One, that is, God&amp;rdquo;, as the Lord Jesus hath said. The rest are only tools in His hands. &amp;ldquo;Gloria in Excelsis&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Glory unto God in the highest&amp;rdquo;, and unto men that deserve, but not to such an undeserving one like me.</description>

YOKOHAMA.
10th July, 1893.
DEAR ALASINGA, BALAJI, G. G., BANKING CORPORATION, AND ALL MY MADRAS FRIENDS,
Excuse my not keeping you constantly informed of my movements. One is so busy every day, and especially myself who am quite new to the life of possessing things and taking care of them. That consumes so much of my energy. It is really an awful botheration.
From Bombay we reached Colombo.</description>

      <description>IV BREEZY MEADOWS,
METCALF, MASS.,
20th August, 1893.
DEAR ALASINGA,
Received your letter yesterday. Perhaps you have by this time got my letter from Japan. From Japan I reached Vancouver. The way was by the Northern Pacific. It was very cold and I suffered much for want of warm clothing. However, I reached Vancouver anyhow, and thence went through Canada to Chicago. I remained about twelve days in Chicago. And almost every day I used to go to the Fair.</description>

      <description>V CHICAGO,
2nd November, 1893.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I am so sorry that a moment&amp;rsquo;s weakness on my part should cause you so much trouble; I was out of pocket at that time. Since then the Lord sent me friends. At a village near Boston I made the acquaintance of Dr. Wright, Professor of Greek in the Harvard University. He sympathised with me very much and urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give me an introduction to the nation.</description>

C/O GEORGE W. HALE ESQ.,
541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO,
28th December, 1893.
DEAR HARIPADA, (Haripada Mitra)
It is very strange that news of my Chicago lectures has appeared in the Indian papers; for whatever I do, I try my best to avoid publicity. Many things strike me here. It may be fairly said that there is no poverty in this country. I have never seen women elsewhere as cultured and educated as they are here.</description>

541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO,
24th January, 1894.
DEAR FRIENDS, (His disciples in Madras)
Your letters have reached me. I am surprised that so much about me has reached you. The criticism you mention of the Interior is not to be taken as the attitude of the American people. That paper is almost unknown here, and belongs to what they call a &amp;ldquo;blue-nose Presbyterian paper&amp;rdquo;, very bigoted.</description>

      <description>VIII NEW YORK,
9th April, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I got your last letter a few days ago. You see I am so very busy here, and have to write so many letters every day, that you cannot expect frequent communications from me. But I try my best to keep you in touch with whatever is going on here. I will write to Chicago for one of the books on the Parliament of Religions to be sent over to you.</description>

MY DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA),
I am in receipt of your letter and am glad to learn that Shashi (Ramakrishnananda) is all right. Now I tell you a curious fact. Whenever anyone of you is sick, let him himself or anyone of you visualise him in your mind, and mentally say and strongly imagine that he is all right. That will cure him quickly. You can do it even without his knowledge, and even with thousands of miles between you.</description>

      <description>X CHICAGO,
28th May, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I could not reply to your note earlier, because I was whirling to and fro from New York to Boston, and also I awaited Narasimha&amp;rsquo;s letter. I do not know when I am going back to India. It is better to leave everything in the hands of Him who is at my back directing me. Try to work without me, as if I never existed.</description>

      <description>XI U. S. A.,
11th July, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
You must never write to me anywhere else but 541 Dearborn Ave., Chicago. Your last letter has travelled the whole country to come to me, and this was only because I am so well known. Some of the resolutions are to be sent to Dr. Barrows with a letter thanking him for his kindness to me and asking him to publish the letter in some American newspapers — as that would be the best refutation of the false charges of the missionaries that I do not represent anybody.</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)
Your very kind letter duly reached me at Annisquam. I am with the Bagleys once more. They are kind as usual. Professor Wright was not here. But he came day before yesterday and we have very nice time together. Mr. Bradley of Evanston, whom you have met at Evanston, was here. His sister-in-law had me sit for a picture several days and had painted me.</description>

      <description>XIII U. S. A.,
31st August, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I just now saw an editorial on me about the circular from Madras in the Boston Transcript. Nothing has reached me yet. They will reach me soon if you have sent them already. So far you have done wonderfully, my boy. Do not mind what I write in some moments of nervousness. One gets nervous sometimes alone in a country 15,000 miles from home, having to fight every inch of ground with orthodox inimical Christians.</description>

      <description>XIV U. S. A.,
21st September, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I have been continuously travelling from place to place and working incessantly, giving lectures, holding classes, etc.
I have not been able to write yet for my proposed book. Perhaps I may be able to take it in hand later on. I have made some nice friends here amongst the liberal people, and a few amongst the orthodox. I hope to return soon to India — I have had enough of this country and especially as too much work is making me nervous.</description>

21st September, 1894.
DEAR KIDI,
I am very sorry to hear your determination of giving up the world so soon. The fruit falls from the tree when it gets ripe. So wait for the time to come. Do not hurry. Moreover, no one has the right to make others miserable by his foolish acts. Wait, have patience, everything will come right in time.
Yours with blessings,</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)
Your letter with the India mail just to hand. A quantity of newspaper clippings were sent over to me from India. I send them back for your perusal and safe keeping.
I am busy writing letters to India last few days. I will remain a few days more in Boston.
With my love and blessings,
Yours ever affly.,

27th September, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . One thing I find in the books of my speeches and sayings published in Calcutta. Some of them are printed in such a way as to savour of political views; whereas I am no politician or political agitator. I care only for the Spirit — when that is right everything will be righted by itself&amp;hellip;. So you must warn the Calcutta people that no political significance be ever attached falsely to any of my writings or sayings.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
You all have done well, my brave unselfish children. I am so proud of you. . . . Hope and do not despair. After such a start, if you despair you are a fool. . . .
Our field is India, and the value of foreign appreciation is in rousing India up. That is all. . . . We must have a strong base from which to spread.</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)
Excuse my long silence; but I have been regularly writing to Mother Church. I am sure you are all enjoying this nice cool weather. I am enjoying Baltimore and Washington very much. I will go hence to Philadelphia. I thought Miss Mary was in Philadelphia, and so I wanted her address. But as she is in some other place near Philadelphia, I do not want to give her the trouble to come up to see me, as Mother Church says.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
I am glad to leant that the phonograph and the letter have reached you safely. You need not send any more newspaper cuttings. I have been deluged with them. Enough of that. Now go to work for the organisation. I have started one already in New York and the Vice-President will soon write to you. Keep correspondence with them. Soon I hope to get up a few in other places.</description>

30th November, 1894.
DEAR KIDI,
. . . As to the wonderful stories published about Shri Ramakrishna, I advise you to keep clear of them and the fools who write them. They are true, but the fools will make a mess of the whole thing, I am sure. He had a whole world of knowledge to teach, why insist upon unnecessary things as miracles really are! They do not prove anything.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED, (Alasinga Perumal)
. . . In reference to me every now and then attacks are made in missionary papers (so I hear), but I never care to see them. If you send any of those made in India, I should throw them into the waste-paper basket. A little agitation was necessary for our work. We have had enough. Pay no more attention to what people say about me, whether good or bad.</description>

Chicago, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
Your letter just to hand. . . . I was mistaken in asking you to publish the scraps I sent you. It was one of my awful mistakes. It shows a moment&amp;rsquo;s weakness. Money can be raised in this country by lecturing for two or three years. But I have tried a little, and although there is much public appreciation of my work, it is thoroughly uncongenial and demoralising to me.</description>

DEAR DHARMAPALA,
I have forgotten your address in Calcutta; so I direct this to the Math. I heard about your speeches in Calcutta and how wonderful was the effect produced by them. A certain retired missionary here wrote me a letter addressing me as brother and then hastily went to publish my short answer and make a show. But you know what people here think of such gentlemen.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road saw an old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire of him the whereabouts of a certain place. &amp;ldquo;How far is such and such a village?&amp;rdquo; he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the traveller turned to go away.</description>

3rd January, 1895.
DEAR MRS. BULL,
I lectured at Brooklyn last Sunday, Mrs. Higgins gave a little reception the evening I arrived, and some of the prominent members of the Ethical Society including Dr. Jain [Janes] were there. Some of them thought that such Oriental religious subjects will not interest the Brooklyn public.
But the lecture, through the blessings of the Lord, proved a tremendous success.</description>

DEAR G. G, (G. G. Narasimhachariar)
Your letter just to hand. . . . The Parliament of Religions was organised with the intention of proving the superiority of the Christian religion over other forms of faith, but the philosophic religion of Hinduism was able to maintain its position notwithstanding.+++(5)+++ Dr. Barrows and the men of that ilk are very orthodox, and I do not look to them for help.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
I am sorry you still continue to send me pamphlets and newspapers, which I have written you several times not to do. I have no time to peruse them and take notice of them. Please send them no more. I do not care a fig for what the missionaries or the Theosophists say about me. Let them do as they please. The very taking notice of them will be to give them importance.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . Meddle not with so-called social reform, for there cannot be any reform without spiritual reform first. Who told you that I want social reform? Not I. Preach the Lord — say neither good nor bad about the superstitions and diets. Do not lose heart, do not lose faith in your Guru, do not lose faith in God. So long as you possess these three, nothing can harm you, my child.</description>

That you have rolled put of it is all right. All&amp;rsquo;s well that ends well.

. . . Do not for a moment think the &amp;ldquo;Yankees&amp;rdquo; are practical in religion. In that the Hindu alone is practical, the Yankee in money-making, so that as soon as I depart, the whole thing will disappear. Therefore I want to have a solid ground under my feet before I depart. Every work should be made thorough. . . . You need not insist upon preaching Shri Ramakrishna.</description>

DEAR S— ,
So you have made up your mind to renounce the world. I have sympathy with your desire. There is nothing so high as renunciation of self. But you must not forget that to forgo your own favourite desire for the welfare of those that depend upon you is no small sacrifice. Follow the spotless life and teachings of Shri Ramakrishna and look after the comforts of your family.</description>

I received your missionary book and the Ramnad photos. I have written to the Raja as well as the Dewan at Mysore. The missionary pamphlet must have reached here long ago, as the Ramabai circle controversy with Dr. Janes savoured of it, it seems. Now you need not be afraid of anything. There is one misstatement in that pamphlet. I never went to a big hotel in this country, and very few times to any other.</description>

      <description>IL U. S. A.,
August 1895.
By the time this reaches you, dear Alasinga, I shall be in Paris. . . . I have done a good deal of work this year and hope to do a good deal more in the next. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother about the missionaries. It is quite natural that they should cry. Who does not when his bread is dwindling away? The missionary funds have got a big gap the last two years, and it is on the increase.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
. . . Now here is another letter from Mr. Sturdy I send it over to you. See how things are being prepared ahead. Don&amp;rsquo;t you think this coupled with Mr. Leggett&amp;rsquo;s invitation as a divine call? I think so and am following it. I am going by the end of August with Mr. Leggett to Paris, and then I go to London.</description>

DEAR FRIEND, (Mr. E. T. Sturdy)
I arrived here day before yesterday. I came over to this country as the guest of an American friend who is going to be married here next week.
I shall have to stop here with him till that time; and after that I shall be free to come to London.
Eagerly anticipating the joy of meeting you,</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I am surprised you take so seriously the missionaries&#39; nonsense. . . . If the people in India want me to keep strictly to my Hindu diet, please tell them to send me a cook and money enough to keep him. This silly bossism without a mite of real help makes me laugh. On the other hand, if the missionaries tell you that I have ever broken the two great vows of the Sannyāsin — chastity and poverty — tell them that they are big liars.</description>

I am going to be in London for a month, then I go off to America and shall come back again next summer. So far you see the seed is well sown in England.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . In England my work is really splendid, I am astonished myself at it. The English people do not: talk much in the newspapers, but they work silently. I am sure of more work in England than in America. Bands and bands come, and I have no room for so many; so they squat on the floor, ladies and all. I tell them to imagine that they are under the sky of India, under a spreading banyan, and they like the idea.</description>

About the Sannyāsin coming over from India, I am sure he will help you in the translation work, also in other work. Later on, when I come, I may send him over to America.

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I have used some very harsh words in my letters, which you ought to excuse, as you know, I get nervous at times. The work is terribly hard; and the more it is growing, the harder it is becoming. I need a long rest very badly. Yet a great work is before me in England.
Have patience, my son — it will grow beyond all your expectations.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . One of my new Sannyāsins is indeed a woman. . . . The others are men. I am going to make some more in England and take them over to India with me. These &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; faces will have more influence in India than the Hindus; moreover, they are vigorous, the Hindus are dead. The only hope of India is from the masses.</description>

Mind, so long as you have faith in your Guru, nothing will be able to obstruct your way. That translation of the three Bhāshyas (commentaries) will be a great thing in the eyes of the Westerners.</description>

DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,
The numbers of Prabuddha Bharata have been received and distributed too to the class. It is very satisfactory. It will have a great sale, no doubt, in India. In America I may get also a number of subscribers. I have already arranged for advertising it in America and Goodyear has done it already.

DEAR ALASINGA,
Since writing to you a few days ago I have found my way to let you know that I am in a position to do this for the Brahmavadin. I will give you Rs. 100 a month for a year or two, i.e. £60 or £70 a year, i.e. as much as would cover Rs. 100 a month. That will set you free to work for the Brahmavadin and make it a better success.</description>

DEAR NANJUNDA RAO,
I have just now got your letter. I am on the move. I have been doing a great deal of mountain-climbing and glacier-crossing in the Alps. Now I am going to Germany. I have an invitation from Prof. Deussen to visit him at Kiel. From thence I go back to England. Possibly I will return to India this winter.
What I objected to in the design for the Prabuddha Bhārata was not only its tawdriness, but the crowding in of a number of figures without any purpose.</description>

DEAR MADAM, (An American lady.)
We have only to grasp the idea of gradation of morality and everything becomes clear.
Renunciation — non-resistance — non-destructiveness — are the ideals to be attained through less and less worldliness, less and less resistance, less and less destructiveness. Keep the ideal in view and work towards it. None can live in the world without resistance, without destruction, without desire.</description>

THE MAHARAJA OF BURDWAN&amp;rsquo;S HOUSE,
DARJEELING,
6th April, 1897.
HONOURED MADAM, (Shrimati Sarala Ghoshal — Editor, Bharati)
I feel much obliged for the Bhārati sent by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause, to which my humble life has been dedicated, has been able to win the approbation off highly talented ladies like you.
In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the initiator off new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land.</description>

MY DEAR DOCTOR SHASHI (BHUSHAN GHOSH),
Your letter and the two bottles containing the medicines were duly received. I have begun from last evening a trial of your medicines. Hope the combination will have a better effect than the one alone.
I began to take a lot of exercise on horseback, both morning and evening. Since that I am very much better indeed. I was so much better the first week of my gymnastics that I have scarcely felt so well since I was a boy and used to have kusti (wrestling) exercises.</description>

DEAR MR.—,
The objections you show about the Vedas would be valid if the word Vedas meant Samhitās. The word Vedas includes the three parts, the Samhitas, the Brāhmanas, and the Upanishads, according to the universally received opinion in India. Of these, the first two portions, as being the ceremonial parts, have been nearly put out of sight; the Upanishads have alone been taken up by all our philosophers and founders of sects.</description>

I am very sorry to read between the lines the desponding tone of your letter, and I understand the cause; thank you for your warning, I understand your motive perfectly. I had arranged to go with Ajit Singh to England; but the doctors not allowing, it fell through. I shall be so happy to learn that Harriet has met him.

Many many thanks for your beautiful and kind letter. I wish I were in London to be able to accept the invitation with the Raja of Khetri. I had a great many dinners to attend in London last season. But it was fated not to be, and my health did not permit my going over with the Raja.
So Alberta is once more at home in America.</description>

MY DEAR JAGAMOHANLAL,
. . . Leave words when you start for Bombay to somebody to take care of three Sannyasins I am sending to Jaipur. Give them food and good lodging. They will be there till I come. They are fellows — innocent, not learned. They belong to me, and one is my Gurubhāi (brother-disciple). If they like, take them to Khetri where I will come soon.</description>

The move is quite original, and never was the life of a great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the writer&amp;rsquo;s mind, as you are presenting this one. The language also is beyond all praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy.
I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the leaflets. I am really in a transport when I read them.</description>

I am starting for Kashmir on Saturday next. I have your letter of introduction to the Resident, but better still if you kindly drop a line to the Resident telling him that you have already given an introduction to me.
Will you kindly ask Jagamohan to write to the Dewan of Kishangarh reminding him of his promise to supply me with copies of Nimbārka Bhāshya on the Vyāsa-Sutras and other Bhashyas (commentaries) through his Pandits.</description>

      <description>Rishi, Muni, or God — none has power to force an institution on society. When the needs of the times press hard on it, society adopts certain customs for self-preservation. Rishis have only recorded those customs As a man often resorts even to such means as are good for immediate self-protection but which are very injurious in the future, similarly society also not unfrequently saves itself for the time being, but these immediate means which contributed to its preservation turn out to be terrible in the long run.</description>

. . . Life is a series of fights and disillusionments. . . . The secret of life is not enjoyment, but education through experience. But, alas, we are called off the moment we begin really to learn. That seems to be a potent argument for a future existence. . . . Everywhere it is better to have a whirlwind come over the work.</description>

Capt. Sevier passed away about three months ago. They have made a fine place here in the mountains and Mrs. Sevier means to keep it up. I am on a visit to her, and I may possibly come over to England with her.</description>

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Ole Bull)
Many thanks for your very encouraging words. I needed them very much just now. The gloom has not lifted with the advent of the new century, it is visibly thickening. I went to see Mrs. Sevier at Mayavati. On my way I learnt of the sudden death of the Raja of Khetri. It appears he was restoring some old architectural monument at Agra, at his own expense, and was up some tower on inspection.</description>

I am going with my mother to Rameswaram, that is all. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I shall go to Madras at all. If I go, it will be strictly private. My body and mind are completely worked out; I cannot stand a single person. I do not want anybody. I have neither the strength nor the money, nor the will to take up anybody with me.</description>

Just now received your nice long letter. I am so glad that you met and approve Miss Cornelia Sorabji. I knew her father at Poona, also a younger sister who was in America. Perhaps her mother will remember me as the Sannyasin who used to live with the Thakore Sahib of Limbdi at Poona.
I hope you will go to Baroda and see the Maharani.</description>

Sometimes it is hard work to be tied to the shoestrings of a great name. And that was just what happened to my letter. You wrote on the 22nd January, 1901. You tied me to the latchet of a great name, Miss MacLeod. Consequently the letter has been following her up and down the world.</description>

The cause of the laughter is that you had a dream through indigestion and made yourself miserable, taking it to be real.

Never have I laid a curse on you, and why should I do so now?</description>

I am so glad you are enjoying Japan — especially Japanese art. You are perfectly correct in saying that we will have to learn many things from Japan. The help that Japan will give us will be with great sympathy and respect, whereas that from the West unsympathetic and destructive. Certainly it is very desirable to establish a connection between India and Japan.</description>

I am so much beholden to mother (Holy Mother — Shri Sarada Devi) for her kind proposal, only I am told by everybody in the Math that Nilambar Babu&amp;rsquo;s place and the whole of the village of Belur at that becomes very malarious this month and the next.</description>

      <description>I had to consult Brahmananda and others, and they were everyone in Calcutta, hence the delay in replying to your last.
The idea of taking a house for a whole year must be worked out with deliberation. As on the one hand there is some risk of catching malaria in Belur this month, in Calcutta on the other hand there is the danger of plague. Then again one is sure to avoid fever if one takes good care not to go into the interior of this village, the immediate bank of the river being entirely free from fever.</description>

      <description>. There are references, though in Buddhistic literature, to Vedanta, and the Mahāyāna school of Buddhism is even Advaitistic. Why does Amara Singha, a Buddhist, give as one of the names of Buddha — Advayavādi ? Charu writes, the word Brahman does not occur in the Upanishads! Quelle bêtise!
I hold the Mahayana to be the older of the two schools of Buddhism.
The theory of Māyā is as old as the Rik-Samhitā.</description>

      <description>CXXI THE MATH,
21st April, 1902.
DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)
It seems the plan of going to Japan seems to have come to nought. Mrs. Bull is gone, you are going. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the Japanese.
Sadananda has accompanied the Japanese to Nepal along with Kanai. Christine could not start earlier, as Margot could not go till the end of this month.
I am getting on splendidly, they say, but yet very weak and no water to drink.</description>

      <description>I send you the letter to Madame Calvé.
. . .
I am somewhat better, but of course far from what I expected. A great idea of quiet has come upon me. I am going to retire for good — no more work for me. If possible, I will revert to my old days of begging.
All blessings attend you, Joe; you have been a good angel to me.
With everlasting love,</description>

      <description>. . . In my opinion, a race must first cultivate a great respect for motherhood, through the sanctification and inviolability of marriage, before it can attain to the ideal of perfect chastity. The Roman Catholics and the Hindus, holding marriage sacred and inviolate, have produced great chaste men and women of immense power. To the Arab, marriage is a contract or a forceful possession, to be dissolved at will, and we do not find there the development of the idea of the virgin or the Brahmachārin.</description>

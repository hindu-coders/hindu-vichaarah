      <description>I A DISCUSSION
(This discussion followed the lecture on the Vedanta Philosophy delivered by the Swami at the Graduate Philosophical Society of Harvard University, U. S. A., on March 25, 1896. (Vol. I. ))
Q. — I should like to know something about the present activity of philosophic thought in India. To what extent are these questions discussed?
A. — As I have said, the majority of the Indian people are practically dualists, and the minority are monists.</description>

      <description>II (At the Twentieth Century Club of Boston, U. S. A.)
Q. — Did Vedanta exert any influence over Mohammedanism?
A. — This Vedantic spirit of religious liberality has very much affected Mohammedanism. Mohammedanism in India is quite a different thing from that in any other country. It is only when Mohammedans come from other countries and preach to their co-religionists in India about living with men who are not of their faith that a Mohammedan mob is aroused and fights.</description>

      <description>III (At the Brooklyn Ethical Society, Brooklyn, U. S. A.)
Q. — How can you reconcile your optimistic views with the existence of evil, with the universal prevalence of sorrow and pain?
A. — I can only answer the question if the existence of evil be first proved; but this the Vedantic religion does not admit. Eternal pain unmixed with pleasure would be a positive evil; but temporal pain and sorrow, if they have contributed an element of tenderness and nobility tending towards eternal bliss, are not evils: on the contrary, they may be supreme good.</description>

      <description>IV (Selections from the Math Diary)
(Translated from Bengali )
Q. — Whom can we call a Guru?
A. — He who can tell your past and future is your Guru.
Q. — How can one have Bhakti?
A. — There is Bhakti within you, only a veil of lust-and-wealth covers it, and as soon as that is removed Bhakti will manifest by itself.
Q. — What is the true meaning of the assertion that we should depend on ourselves?</description>

      <description>V YOGA, VAIRAGYA, TAPASYA, LOVE
Q. — Does Yoga serve to keep the body in its full health and vitality?
A. — It does. It staves off disease. As objectification of one&amp;rsquo;s own body is difficult, it is very effective in regard to others. Fruit and milk are the best food for Yogis.
Q. — Is the attainment of bliss synchronous with that of Vairagya?
A. — The first step in Vairagya is very painful.</description>

      <description>VI IN ANSWER TO NIVEDITA
(In answer to a few questions put by Sister Nivedita, Swamiji jotted down the replies on May 24, 1900 at San Francisco.)
Q. — I cannot remember what parts Prithvi Rai and Chānd disguised themselves to play, when they determined to attend the Svayamvara at Kanauj.
A. — Both went as minstrels.
Q. — Also did Prithvi Rai determine to marry Samyuktā partly because she was the daughter of his rival and partly for the fame of her great beauty?</description>

      <description>VII GURU, AVATARA, YOGA, JAPA, SEVA
Q. — How can Vedanta be realised?
A. — By &amp;ldquo;hearing, reflection, and meditation&amp;rdquo;. Hearing must take place from a Sad-guru. Even if one is not a regular disciple, but is a fit aspirant and hears the Sad-guru&amp;rsquo;s words, he is liberated.
Q. — Who is a Sad-guru?
A. — A Sad-guru is one on whom the spiritual power has descended by Guru-paramparā, or an unbroken chain of discipleship.</description>

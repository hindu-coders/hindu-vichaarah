      <description>REASON, FAITH AND LOVE [Swamiji had made the home of the Hale family his headquarters during almost all of 1894 before the pivot of his activities moved eastward to the Atlantic Coast. It was on George W. Hale&amp;rsquo;s letter paper and thus, presumably, during one of his stays in the latter&amp;rsquo;s home, that Swamiji jotted down in pencil a series of notes on the subjects of reason, faith, and love, which have recently come to light.</description>

      <description>SIX SANSKRIT MOTTOES (Reproduced from Swami Vivekananda in America: New Discoveries. These together with the English translations, were transcribed by Swamiji in six of his photographs.)
1. Ajarāmaravat prājnah vidyām
artham cha chintayet
Grihita iva kesheshu mrityunā
dharmam ācharet
When in search of knowledge or prosperity think that thou would never have death or disease, and when worshipping God think that death&amp;rsquo;s hand is in your hair.
2. Eka eve suhrid dharma</description>

      <description>THE MESSAGE OF DIVINE WISDOM [The following three chapters were discovered among Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s papers. He evidently intended to write a book and jotted down some points for the work.]
I BONDAGE II THE LAW
III THE ABSOLUTE AND THE ATTAINMENT OF FREEDOM
I
BONDAGE
1. Desire is infinite, its fulfilment limited. Desire is unlimited in everyone; the power of fulfilment varies. Thus some are more successful than others in life.</description>

      <description>THE BELUR MATH: AN APPEAL The success which attended the labours of the disciples of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in diffusing the principles of Hindu religion and obtaining some respect for our much abused faith in the West, gave rise to the hope of training a number of young Sannyāsins to carry on the propaganda, both in and out of India. And an attempt is being made to educate a number of young men according to the Vedic principle of students living in touch with the Guru.</description>

      <description>THE ADVAITA ASHRAMA, HIMALAYAS (These lines were sent in a letter, March, 1899, by Swamiji, for embodying in the prospectus of the Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himalayas.)
In Whom is the Universe, Who is in the Universe, Who is the Universe; in Whom is the Soul, Who is in the Soul, Who is the Soul of Man; knowing Him — and therefore the Universe — as our Self, alone extinguishes all fear, brings an end to misery and leads to Infinite Freedom.</description>

      <description>THE RAMAKRISHNA HOME OF SERVICE VARANASI: AN APPEAL (Letter written by Swamiji, to accompany the First Report of the Ramakrishna Home of Service, Varanasi, February, 1902.)
DEAR —
We beg your acceptance of the past year&amp;rsquo;s Report of the Ramakrishna Home of Service, Varanasi, embodying a short statement of our humble efforts towards the amelioration, however little, of the miserable state into which a good many of our fellow-beings, generally old men and women, are cast in this city.</description>

      <description>WHO KNOWS HOW MOTHER PLAYS! Perchance a prophet thou —
Who knows? Who dares touch
The depths where Mother hides
Her silent failless bolts!
Perchance the child had glimpse
Of shades, behind the scenes,
With eager eyes and strained,
Quivering forms — ready
To jump in front and be
Events, resistless, strong.
Who knows but Mother, how,
And where, and when, they come?
Perchance the shining sage
Saw more than he could tell;</description>

      <description>TO THE FOURTH OF JULY [It is well known that Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s death (or resurrection, as some of us would prefer to call it!) took place on the 4th of July, 1902. On the 4th of July, 1898, he was travelling with some American disciples in Kashmir, and as part of a domestic conspiracy for the celebration of the day — the anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence — he prepared the following poem, to be read aloud at the early breakfast.</description>

      <description>THE EAST AND THE WEST (Translated from Bengali)
I. INTRODUCTION (Bengali)
II. CUSTOMS: EASTERN AND WESTERN (Bengali)
III. FOOD AND COOKING (Bengali)
IV. CIVILISATION IN DRESS (Bengali)
V. ETIQUETTE AND MANNERS (Bengali)
VI. FRANCE — PARIS (Bengali)
VII. PROGRESS OF CIVILISATION (Bengali)
I. INTRODUCTION
Vast and deep rivers — swelling and impetuous — charming pleasure-gardens by the river banks, putting to shame the celestial Nandana-Kānana; amidst these pleasure-gardens rise, towering to the sky, beautiful marble palaces, decorated with the most exquisite workmanship of fine art; on the sides, in front, and behind, clusters of huts, with crumbling mud-walls and dilapidated roofs, the bamboos of which, forming their skeletons, as it were, are exposed to view; moving about here and there emaciated figures of young and old in tattered rags, whose faces bear deep-cut lines of the despair and poverty of hundreds of years; cows, bullocks, buffaloes everywhere — ay, the same melancholy look in their eyes, the same feeble physique; on the wayside refuse and dirt: This is our present-day India!</description>

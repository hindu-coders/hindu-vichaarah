      <description>JNANA YOGA - I (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
Om Tat Sat! To know the Om is to know the secret of the universe. The object of Jnāna-Yoga is the same as that of Bhakti and Rāja Yogas, but the method is different. This is the Yoga for the strong, for those who are neither mystical nor devotional, but rational.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - II (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
The greatest teacher of the Vedanta philosophy was Shankārachārya. By solid reasoning he extracted from the Vedas the truths of Vedanta, and on them built up the wonderful system of Jnāna that is taught in his commentaries.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - III (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
Jnāna teaches that the world should be given up, but not on that account to be abandoned. To be in the world, but not of it, is the true test of the Sannyāsin. This idea of renunciation has been in some form common to nearly all religions.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - IV (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
All men, so-called, are not yet really human beings. Every one has to judge of this world through his own mind. The higher understanding is extremely difficult. The concrete is more to most people than the abstract.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - V (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
The question why there cannot be eternal bodies is in itself illogical, as &amp;ldquo;body&amp;rdquo; is a term applied to a certain combination of elements, changeable and in its very nature impermanent. When we are not passing through changes, we will not have bodies (so-called).</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - VI (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
Thought is all important, for &amp;ldquo;what we think we become&amp;rdquo;. There was once a Sannyāsin, a holy man, who sat under a tree and taught the people. He drank milk, and ate only fruit, and made endless &amp;ldquo;Prānāyāmas&amp;rdquo;, and felt himself to be very holy.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - VII (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
The Self is the condition of all in the universe, but It can never be conditioned. As soon as we know that we are It, we are free. As mortals we are not and never can be free.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - VIII (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
Both happiness and misery are chains, the one golden, the other iron; but both are equally strong to bind us and hold us back from realising our true nature. The Atman knows neither happiness nor misery.</description>

      <description>JNANA YOGA - IX (These were originally recorded by a prominent American disciple of the Swami, Miss S. E. Waldo. Swami Saradananda, while he was in America (1896), copied them out from her notebook — Ed.)
Expression is necessarily degeneration, because spirit can only be expressed by the &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo;, and as St. Paul said, &amp;ldquo;the letter killeth&amp;rdquo;. Life cannot be in the &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo; which is only a reflection. Yet, principle must be clothed in matter to be &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo;.</description>

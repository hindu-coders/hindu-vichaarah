      <description>WOMEN OF INDIA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club House, in Pasadena, California, on January 18, 1900)
SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: &amp;ldquo;Some persons desire to ask questions about Hindu Philosophy before the lecture and to question in general about India after the lecture; but the chief difficulty is I do not know what I am to lecture on. I would be very glad to lecture on any subject, either on Hindu Philosophy or on anything concerning the race, its history, or its literature.</description>

      <description>MY LIFE AND MISSION (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club of Pasadena, California, on January 27, 1900)
Now, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for this morning was to have been the Vedanta Philosophy. That subject itself is interesting, but rather dry and very vast.
Meanwhile, I have been asked by your president and some of the ladies and gentlemen here to tell them something about my work and what I have been doing.</description>

      <description>BUDDHA&amp;rsquo;S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 18, 1900)
Buddhism is historically the most important religion — historically, not philosophically — because it was the most tremendous religious movement that the world ever saw, the most gigantic spiritual wave ever to burst upon human society. There is no civilisation on which its effect has not been felt in some way or other.
The followers of Buddha were most enthusiastic and very missionary in spirit.</description>

      <description>DISCIPLESHIP (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900)
My subject is &amp;ldquo;Discipleship&amp;rdquo;. I do not know how you will take what I have to say. It will be rather difficult for you to accept it — the ideals of teachers and disciples in this country vary so much from those in ours. An old proverb of India comes to my mind: &amp;ldquo;There are hundreds of thousands of teachers, but it is hard to find one disciple.</description>

      <description>IS VEDANTA THE FUTURE RELIGION? (Delivered in San Francisco on April 8, 1900)
Those of you who have been attending my lectures for the last month or so must, by this time, be familiar with the ideas contained in the Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta is the most ancient religion of the world; but it can never be said to have become popular. Therefore the question &amp;ldquo;Is it going to be the religion of the future?</description>

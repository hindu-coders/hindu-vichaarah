      <description>STRUGGLE FOR EXPANSION (Written by the Swami during his first visit to America in answer to questions put by a Western disciple.)
The old dilemma, whether the tree precedes the seed or the seed the tree, runs through all our forms of knowledge. Whether intelligence is first in the order of being or matter; whether the ideal is first or the external manifestation; whether freedom is our true nature or bondage of law; whether thought creates matter or matter thought; whether the incessant change in nature precedes the idea of rest or the idea of rest precedes the idea of change — all these are questions of the same insoluble nature.</description>

      <description>THE BIRTH OF RELIGION (Written by the Swami during his first visit to America in answer to questions put by a Western disciple.)
The beautiful flowers of the forest with their many-coloured petals, nodding their heads, jumping, leaping, playing with every breeze; the beautiful birds with their gorgeous plumage, their sweet songs echoing through every forest glade — they were there yesterday, my solace, my companions, and today they are gone — where?</description>

      <description>FOUR PATHS OF YOGA (Written by the Swami during his first visit to America in answer to questions put by a Western disciple.)
Our main problem is to be free. It is evident then that until we realise ourselves as the Absolute, we cannot attain to deliverance. Yet there are various ways of attaining to this realisation. These methods have the generic name of Yoga (to join, to join ourselves to our reality).</description>

      <description>CYCLIC REST AND CHANGE (Written by the Swami during his first visit to America in answer to questions put by a Western disciple.)
This whole universe is a case of lost balance. All motion is the struggle of the disturbed universe to regain its equilibrium, which, as such, cannot be motion. Thus in regard to the internal world it would be a state which is beyond thought, for thought itself is a motion.</description>

      <description>A PREFACE TO THE IMITATION OF CHRIST (Translated from an original Bengali writing of the Swami in 1889. The passage is the preface to his Bengali translation of The Imitation of Christ which he contributed to a Bengali monthly. He translated only six chapters with quotations of parallel passages from the Hindu scriptures.)
The Imitation of Christ is a cherished treasure of the Christian world. This great book was written by a Roman Catholic monk.</description>

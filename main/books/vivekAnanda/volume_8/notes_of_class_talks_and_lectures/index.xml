      <description>NOTES OF CLASS TALKS WHEN WILL CHRIST COME AGAIN?
I never take much notice of these things. I have come to deal with principles. I have only to preach that God comes again and again, and that He came in India as Krishna, Rāma, and Buddha, and that He will come again. It can almost be demonstrated that after each 500 years the world sinks, and a tremendous spiritual wave comes, and on the top of the wave is a Christ.</description>

      <description>MAN THE MAKER OF HIS DESTINY There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalised and recorded and made into a huge book.</description>

      <description>GOD: PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL My idea is that what you call a Personal God is the same as the Impersonal Being, a Personal and Impersonal God at the same time. We are personalised impersonal beings. If you use the word in the absolute sense, we are impersonal; but if you use it in a relative meaning, we are personal. Each one of you is a universal being, each one is omnipresent.</description>

      <description>THE DIVINE INCARNATION OR AVATARA Jesus Christ was God — the Personal God become man. He has manifested Himself many times in different forms and these alone are what you can worship. God in His absolute nature is not to be worshipped. Worshipping such God would be nonsense. We have to worship Jesus Christ, the human manifestation, as God. You cannot worship anything higher than the manifestation of God. The sooner you give up the worship of God separate from Christ, the better for you.</description>

      <description>PRANAYAMA First of all we will try to understand a little of the meaning of Prānāyama. Prāna stands in metaphysics for the sum total of the energy that is in the universe. This universe, according to the theory of the philosophers, proceeds in the form of waves; it rises, and again it subsides, melts away, as it were; then again it proceeds out in all this variety; then again it slowly returns.</description>

      <description>WOMEN OF THE EAST (As many women as could crowd into Hall 7 yesterday afternoon flocked thither to hear something as to the lives of their sisters of the Orient. Mrs. Potter Palmer and Mrs. Charles Henrotin sat upon the platform, surrounded by turbanned representatives of the women of the East.
It may interest the readers to know that the published addresses of Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago are not exhaustive and many addresses, specially those delivered at the Scientific Section of the Parliament were not all reported.</description>

      <description>CONGRESS OF RELIGIOUS UNITY (Report of a lecture in the Chicago Sunday Herald, September 24, 1893)
Swami Vivekananda said, &amp;ldquo;All the words spoken at this parliament come to the common conclusion that the brotherhood of man is the much-to-be-desired end. Much has been said for this brotherhood as being a natural condition, since we are all children of one God. Now, there are sects that do not admit of the existence of God — that is, a Personal God.</description>

      <description>THE LOVE OF GOD - I (Report of a lecture in the Chicago Herald, September 25, 1893)
An audience that filled the auditorium of the Third Unitarian Church at Laflin and Monroe streets heard Swami Vivekananda preach yesterday morning. The subject of his sermon was the love of God, and his treatment of the theme was eloquent and unique. He said that God was worshipped in all parts of the world, but by different names and in different ways.</description>

      <description>THE LOVE OF GOD - II (A lecture delivered in the Unitarian Church of Detroit on February 20, 1894
and reported in the Detroit Free Press)
Vivekananda delivered a lecture on &amp;ldquo;The Love of God&amp;rdquo; at the Unitarian Church last night before the largest audience that he has yet had. The trend of the lecturer&amp;rsquo;s remarks was to show that we do not accept God because we really want Him, but because we have need of Him for selfish purposes.</description>

      <description>INDIA (Report of a lecture delivered at Detroit on Thursday, February 15, 1894, with
the editorial comments of the Detroit Free Press)
An audience that filled the Unitarian Church heard the renowned monk, Swami Vivekananda, deliver a lecture last night on the manners and customs of his country. His eloquent and graceful manner pleased his listeners, who followed him from beginning to end with the closest attention, showing approval from time to time by outbursts of applause.</description>

      <description>HINDUS AND CHRISTIANS (A lecture delivered at Detroit on February 21, 1894, and reported

Of the different philosophies, the tendency of the Hindu is not to destroy, but to harmonise everything. If any new idea comes into India, we do not antagonise it, but simply try to take it in, to harmonise it, because this method was taught first by our prophet, God incarnate on earth, Shri Krishna.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Vive Kananda spoke to a crowded audience at the Detroit Opera House last night. He was given an extremely cordial reception and delivered his most eloquent address here. He spoke for two hours and a half.
Hon. T. W. Palmer, in introducing the distinguished visitor, referred to the old tale of the shield that was copper on one side and silver on the other and the contest which ensued.</description>

      <description>THE RELIGION OF LOVE (Notes of a lecture delivered in London on November 16, 1895)
Just as it is necessary for a man to go through symbols and ceremonies first in order to arrive at the depth of realisation, so we say in India, &amp;ldquo;It is good to be born in a church, but bad to die in one&amp;rdquo;. A sapling must be hedged about for protection, but when it becomes a tree, a hedge would be a hindrance.</description>

      <description>JNANA AND KARMA (Notes of a lecture delivered in London, on November 23, 1895)
The greatest force is derived from the power of thought. The finer the element, the more powerful it is. The silent power of thought influences people even at a distance, because mind is one as well as many. The universe is a cobweb; minds are spiders.
The universe equals the phenomena of one Universal Being. He, seen through our senses, is the universe.</description>

      <description>THE CLAIMS OF VEDANTA ON THE MODERN WORLD (Report of a lecture delivered in Oakland on Sunday, February 25, 1900, with
editorial comments of the Oakland Enquirer)
The announcement that Swami Vivekananda, a distinguished savant of the East, would expound the philosophy of Vedanta in the Parliament of Religions at the Unitarian Church last evening, attracted an immense throng. The main auditorium and ante-rooms were packed, the annexed auditorium of Wendte Hall was thrown open, and this was also filled to overflowing, and it is estimated that fully 500 persons, who could not obtain seats or standing room where they could hear conveniently, were turned away.</description>

      <description>THE LAWS OF LIFE AND DEATH (Report of a lecture delivered in Oakland on March 7, 1900, with editorial comments of the Oakland Tribune)
Swami Vivekananda delivered a lecture last evening on the subject, &amp;ldquo;The Laws of Life and Death&amp;rdquo;. The Swami said: &amp;ldquo;How to get rid of this birth and death — not how to go to heaven, but how one can stop going to heaven — this is the object of the search of the Hindu.</description>

      <description>THE REALITY AND THE SHADOW (Report of a lecture delivered in Oakland on March 8, 1900, with editorial comments

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu philosopher, delivered another lecture in Wendte Hall last evening. His subject was: &amp;ldquo;The Reality and The Shadow&amp;rdquo;. He said:
&amp;ldquo;The soul of man is ever striving after certainty, to find something that does not change. It is never satisfied. Wealth, the gratification of ambition or of appetite are all changeable.</description>

The subject tonight is man, man in contrast with nature. For a long time the word &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; was used almost exclusively to denote external phenomena. These phenomena were found to behave methodically; and they often repeated themselves: that which had happened in the past happened again — nothing happened only once. Thus it was concluded that nature was uniform.</description>

      <description>UNITY (Notes of a lecture delivered at the Vedanta Society, New York, in June, 1900)
The different sectarian systems of India all radiate from one central idea of unity or dualism.
They are all under Vedanta, all interpreted by it. Their final essence is the teaching of unity. This, which we see as many, is God. We perceive matter, the world, manifold sensation. Yet there is but one existence.
These various names mark only differences of degree in the expression of that One.</description>

      <description>THE WORSHIP OF THE DIVINE MOTHER (Fragmentary notes taken on a Sunday afternoon in New York in June, 1900)
From the tribal or clan-God, man arrives, in every religion, at the sum, the God of gods.
Confucius alone has expressed the one eternal idea of ethics. &amp;ldquo;Manu Deva&amp;rdquo; was transformed into Ahriman. In India, the mythological expression was suppressed; but the idea remained. In an old Veda is found the Mantra, &amp;ldquo;I am the empress of all that lives, the power in everything.</description>

      <description>THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION (Report of a lecture delivered in America)
In France the &amp;ldquo;rights of man&amp;rdquo; was long a watchword of the race; in America the rights of women still beseech the public ear; in India we have concerned ourselves always with the rights of Gods.
The Vedanta includes all sects. We have a peculiar idea in India. Suppose I had a child; I should not teach him any religion, but the practice of concentrating his mind; and just one line of prayer — not prayer in your sense, but this: &amp;ldquo;I meditate on Him who is the Creator of the universe; may He enlighten my mind.</description>

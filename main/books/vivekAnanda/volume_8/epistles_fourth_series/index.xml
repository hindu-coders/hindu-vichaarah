      <description>CXLIV To Miss Mary Hale
RIDGELY MANOR,
3rd October, 1899.
MY DEAR MARY,
Thanks for your very kind words. I am much better now and growing so every day. Mrs. Bull and her daughter are expected today or tomorrow. We hope thus to have another spell of good time — you are having yours all the time, of course. I am glad you are going to Philadelphia, but not so much now as then — when the millionaire was on the horizon.</description>

      <description>CXLV To Miss Mary Hale
RIDGELY MANOR,
30th October, 1899.
MY DEAR OPTIMIST,
I received your letter and am thankful that something has come to force optimistic laissez faire into action. Your questions have tapped the very source of pessimism, however. British rule in modern India has only one redeeming feature, though unconscious; it has brought India out once more on the stage of the world; it has forced upon it the contact of the outside world.</description>

C/O F. LEGGETT ESQ.,
RIDGELY MANOR,
ULSTER COUNTY, N.Y.
MY DEAR STURDY,
Your last letter reached me after knocking about a little through insufficient address.
It is quite probable that very much of your criticism is just and correct. It is also possible that some day you may find that all this springs from your dislike of certain persons, and I was the scapegoat.</description>

      <description>CXLVII To Mrs. Ole Bull
C/O E. GUERNSEY, M.D.,
THE MADRID, 180 W. 59,
15th November, 1899.
MY DEAR MRS. BULL,
After all I decide to come to Cambridge just now. I must finish the stories I began. The first one I don&amp;rsquo;t think was given back to me by Margo.
My clothes will be ready the day after tomorrow, and then I shall be ready to start; only my fear is, it will be for the whole winter a place for becoming nervous and not for quieting of nerves, with constant parties and lectures.</description>

To Swami Brahmananda
U.S.A.,
20th November, 1899.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Got some news from Sharat&amp;rsquo;s letter. . . . Get experience while still there is a chance; I am not concerned whether you win or lose. . . . I have no disease now. Again. . . . I am going to tour from place to place. There is no reason for anxiety, be fearless. Everything will fly away before you; only don&amp;rsquo;t be disobedient, and all success will be yours.</description>

1 EAST 39 ST., NEW YORK,
20th November, 1899.
MY DEAR MARY,
I start tomorrow most probably for California. On my way I would stop for a day or two in Chicago. I send a wire to you when I start. Send somebody to the station, as I never was so bad as now in finding my way in and out.
Ever your brother,
VIVEKANANDA.</description>

MY DEAR BRAHMANANDA,
The accounts are all right. I have handed them over to Mrs. Bull who has taken charge of reporting the different parts of the accounts to different donors. Never mind what I have said in previous harsh letters. They would do you good. Firstly, they will make you business-like in the future to keep regular and clear accounts and get the brethren into it.</description>

MY DEAR DHIRA MATA,
I have a letter from Calcutta today, from which I learn your cheques have arrived; a great many thanks and grateful words also came.
Miss Souter of London sends me a printed New Year&amp;rsquo;s greetings. I think she must have got the accounts you sent her by this time.
Kindly send Saradananda&amp;rsquo;s letters that have come to your care.</description>

BELOVED DHIRA MATA,
An eventful and happy New Year to you and many such returns!
I am much better in health — able enough to work once more. I have started work already and have sent to Saradananda some money — Rs. 1,300 already — as expenses for the law suit. I shall send more, if they need it.</description>

MY DEAR MARY,
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and many, many glorious returns of such for your birthday. All these wishes, prayers, greetings in one breath. I am cured, you will be glad to know. It was only indigestion and no heart or kidney affection, quoth the healers; nothing more. And I am walking three miles a day — after a heavy dinner.</description>

17th January, 1900.
MY DEAR DHIRA MATA,
I received yours with the enclosures for Saradananda; and there was some good news. I hope to get some more news this week. You did not write anything about your plans. I had a letter from Miss Greenstidel expressing her deep gratitude for your kindness — and who does not? Turiyananda is getting well by this time, I hope.</description>

LOS ANGELES,
15th February, 1900.
DEAR DHIRA MATA,
Before this reaches you, I am off to San Francisco. You already know all about the work. I have not done much work, but my heart is growing stronger every day, physically and mentally. Some days I feel I can bear everything and suffer everything. There was nothing of note inside the bundle of papers sent by Miss Müller.</description>

      <description>CLVI To Miss Mary Hale
PASADENA,
20th February, 1900.
MY DEAR MARY,
Your letter bearing the sad news of Mr. Hale&amp;rsquo;s passing away reached me yesterday. I am sorry, because in spite of monastic training, the heart lives on; and then Mr. Hale was one of the best souls I met in life. Of course you are sorry, miserable, and so are Mother Church and Harriet and the rest, especially as this is the first grief of its kind you have met, is it not?</description>

DEAR MARY,
Very kind of you to write to invite me to Chicago. I wish I could be there this minute. But I am busy making money; only I do not make much. Well, I have to make enough to pay my passage home at any rate. Here is a new field, where I find ready listeners by hundreds, prepared beforehand by my books.</description>

1502 JONES STREET,
SAN FRANCISCO,

DEAR DHIRA MATA,
I have not had a word from you for a month. I am in Frisco. The people here have been prepared by my writing beforehand, and they come in big crowds. But it remains to be seen how much of that enthusiasm endures when it comes to paying at the door. Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills invited me to Oakland and gave me big crowds to preach to.</description>

DEAR DHIRA MATA,
Your letter, enclosing one from Saradananda only and the accounts, came. I am very much reassured by all the news I since received from India. As for the accounts and the disposal of the Rs. 30,000, do just what you please. I have given over the management to you, the Master will show you what is best to do.</description>

DEAR JOE,
I learn from Mrs. Bull&amp;rsquo;s letter that you are in Cambridge.
I also learn from Miss Helen that you did not get the stories sent on to you. I am sorry. Margot has copies she may give you. I am so so in health. No money. Hard work. No result. Worse than Los Angeles.
They come in crowds when the lecture is free — when there is payment, they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
I got a letter from you some time ago. A letter from Sharat reached me yesterday. I saw a copy of the invitation letters for the birthday anniversary of Gurudeva (Divine Master). I am frightened hearing that Sharat is troubled by rheumatism. Alas, sickness, sorrow, and pain have been my companions for the last two years.</description>

MY DEAR MARY,
Many thanks for your kind note. You are correct that I have many other thoughts to think besides Indian people, but they have all to go to the background before the all-absorbing mission — my Master&amp;rsquo;s work.
I would that this sacrifice were pleasant. It is not, and naturally makes one bitter at times; for know, Mary, I am yet a man and cannot wholly forget myself; hope I shall some time.</description>

WELL BLESSED MARY,
This is to let you know &amp;ldquo;I am very happy&amp;rdquo;. Not that I am getting into a shadowy optimism, but my power of suffering is increasing. I am being lifted up above the pestilential miasma of this world&amp;rsquo;s joys and sorrows; they are losing their meaning. It is a land of dreams; it does not matter whether one enjoys or weeps; they are but dreams, and as such, must break sooner or later.</description>

I have just received a bill of lading from Mrs. Banerji. She has sent some Dāl (pulses) and rice. I am sending the bill of lading to you. Give it to Miss Waldo; she will bring all these things when they come.

Many thanks for the prompt sending of the books. They will sell quick, I believe. You have become worse than me in changing your plans, I see. I wonder why I have not got any Awakened India yet. My mail is getting so knocked about, I am afraid.
I am working hard — making some money — and am getting better in health.</description>

DEAR HARIBHAI,
I am glad to hear that your leg is all right and that you are doing splendid work. My body is going on all right. The thing is, I fall ill when I take too much precaution. I am cooking, eating whatever comes, working day and night, and I am all right and sleeping soundly!
I am going over to New York within a month.</description>

MY DEAR JOE,
Just a line before you start for France. Are you going via England? I had a beautiful letter from Mrs. Sevier in which I find that Miss Müller sent simply a paper without any other words to Kali who was with her in Darjeeling.
Congreave is the name of her nephew, and he is in the Transvaal war; that is the reason she underlined that, to show her nephew fighting the Boers in Transvaal.</description>

DEAR DHIRA MATA,
Your kind note came this morning. I am so happy to learn that all the New York friends are being cured by Mrs. Milton. She has been very unsuccessful, it seems, in Los Angeles, as all the people we introduced tell me. Some are in a worse state than before the skin paring. Kindly give Mrs.</description>

Glad you have returned. Gladder you are going to Paris. I shall go to Paris of course, only don&amp;rsquo;t know when. Mrs. Leggett thinks I ought to immediately, and take up studying French. Well, take what comes. So you do too.
Finish your books, and in Paris we are going to conquer the Froggies. How is Mary? Give her my love.</description>

Mother is becoming propitious once more. Things are looking up. They must.
Work always brings evil with it. I have paid for the accumulated evil with bad health. I am glad. My mind is all the better for it. There is a mellowness and a calmness in life now, which was never there before. I am learning now how to be detached as well as attached, and mentally becoming my own master.</description>

MY DEAR JOE,
Received your note today. I wrote you one yesterday but directed it to England thinking you will be there.
I have given your message to Mrs. Betts. I am so sorry this little quarrel came with A__. I got also his letter you sent. He is correct so far as he says, &amp;ldquo;Swami wrote me &amp;lsquo;Mr. Leggett is not interested in Vedanta and will not help any more.</description>

MY DEAR MARY,
I ought to have started today but circumstances so happened that I cannot forgo the temptation to be in a camp under the huge red-wood trees of California before I leave. Therefore I postpone it for three or four days. Again after the incessant work I require a breath of God&amp;rsquo;s free air before I start on this bone-breaking journey of four days.</description>

Sudden indisposition and fever prevent my starting for Chicago yet. I will start as soon as I am strong for the journey. I had a letter from Margot the other day. Give her kindly my love, and know yourself my eternal love. Where is Harriet? Still in Chicago? And the McKindley sisters? To all my love.

MY DEAR NIVEDITA,
I have been very ill — one more relapse brought about by months of hard work. Well, it has shown me that I have no kidney or heart disease whatsoever, only overworked nerves. I am, therefore, going today in the country for some days till I completely recover, which I am sure will be in a few days.
In the meanwhile I do not want to read any India letters with the plague news etc.</description>

It is true I am much better, but not yet completely recovered; anyway, the complexion of the mind is one belonging to everyone that suffers. It is neither gas nor anything else.
Kāli worship is not a necessary step in any religion. The Upanishads teach us all there is of religion. Kali worship is my special fad; you never heard me preach it, or read of my preaching it in India.</description>

To Swami Turiyananda
6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,
DA FOREST P.O., SANTA CLARA CO.,
PARIS, FRANCE,
1st September, 1900.
MY DEAR HARI,
I learnt everything from your letter. Earlier I had an inkling of some trouble between the full-fledged Vedantist and the Home of Truth — someone wrote that. Such things do occur; wisdom consists in carrying on the work by cleverly keeping all in good humour.</description>

6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,
September, 1900.
MY DEAR TURIYANANDA,
Just now I received your letter. Through Mother&amp;rsquo;s will all work will go on; don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid. I shall soon leave for some other place. Perhaps I shall be on a tour of Constantinople and other places for some time. Mother knows what will come next. I have received a letter from Mrs. Wilmot. From this, too, it appears that she is very enthusiastic.</description>

CXCIV (Translated from the original in French)
To Madame Emma Calve
6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS, PARIS,
October, 1900.
MY DEAR MADEMOISELLE,
I have been very happy and content here. I am having the best of times after many years. I find life here with Mr. Bois very satisfactory — the books, the calm, and the absence of everything that usually troubles me.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of destiny is waiting for me now.</description>

To Sister Christine
6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,
PARIS,
14th October, 1900.
God bless you at each step, my dear Christine, such is my constant prayer!
Your letter, so beautiful and so calm, has given me that fresh energy which I am often losing.
I am happy, yes, I am happy, but the cloud has not left me entirely. It sometimes comes back, unfortunately, but it no longer has the morbidity it used to have.</description>

PORT TEWFICK
26th November, 1900.
DEAR JOE,
The steamer was late; so I am waiting. Thank goodness, it entered the Canal this morning at Port Said. That means it will arrive some time in the evening if everything goes right.
Of course it is like solitary imprisonment these two days, and I am holding my soul in patience.
But they say the change is thrice dear.</description>

MY DEAR MOTHER,
Three days ago I reached here. It was quite unexpected — my visit, and everybody was so surprised.
Things here have gone better than I expected during my absence, only Mr. Sevier has passed away. It was a tremendous blow, sure, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know the future of the work in the Himalayas.</description>

Before leaving for the USA, Swamiji used to change his name very often. In earlier years he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the readers, these volumes use the more familiar name Vivekananda.</description>

I have received the book of Pānini which you so kindly sent me. Please accept my gratitude for the same.
I had an attack of fever again — hence I could not reply to you immediately. Please excuse. I am ailing much. I am praying to the Divine Mother to keep you happy physically and mentally.</description>

BARANAGORE,
22nd February, 1889.
DEAR SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)
I had intended to go to Varanasi, and I planned to reach there after visiting the birthplace of my Master. But unluckily on the way to that village I had an attack of high fever followed by vomiting and purging as in cholera. There was again fever after three or four days — and as the body is now so weak that I can barely walk even two steps, I have been compelled now to give up my previous intention.</description>

RESPECTED SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)
It is several days since I received your last letter. Please excuse the delay in replying, which was due to some special reasons. I am very ill at present; there is fever now and then, but there is no disorder in the spleen or other organs. I am under homeopathic treatment. Now I have had to give up completely the intention of going to Varanasi.</description>

RESPECTED SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)
I was very glad to get your letter. In such circumstances many give the advice to incline towards the worldly life. But you are truthful and have an adamantine heart. I have been highly comforted by your encouraging and cheering words. My difficulties here have almost come to a close — only I have engaged the services of a broker for the sale of a piece of land, and I hope the sale will be over soon.</description>

He is a very honest and intelligent boy and is an undergraduate of the Calcutta University. You know how hard the struggle is in Bengal nowadays, and the poor boy has been out in search of some job.</description>

On my way here, I wanted to go to your place at Nadiad and redeem my pledge, but certain circumstances prevented me, and the greatest of them was that you were not there; and to play Hamlet leaving Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s part out is a ridiculous affair; and as I know for certain that you are to return in a few days to Nadiad, and as I am shortly going back to Bombay, say in 20 days, I thought it better to postpone my visit for that time.</description>

It was from my brethren at Calcutta, and it is written on the occasion of a private invitation to celebrate the birthday of my Master about whom you have heard so much from me — so I send it over to you. The letter says that Mazoomdar has gone back to Calcutta and is preaching that Vivekananda is committing every sin under the sun in America.</description>

      <description>XIX To Miss Mary Hale
DETROIT,
30th March, 1894.
DEAR SISTER,
Your and Mother Church&amp;rsquo;s letters came together just now, acknowledging the receipt of the money. I am very glad to receive the Khetri letter, which I send back for your perusal. You would find from it that he wants some newspaper clippings. I do not think I have any except the Detroit one, which I will send to him. If you can get hold of some others, kindly send some over to him if it be possible and convenient.</description>

      <description>XX To Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai
CHICAGO,
20th June, 1894.
DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB,
Your very kind note came today. I am so sorry that I could have caused pain to such a noble heart as yours with my rash and strong words. I bow down to your mild corrections. &amp;ldquo;Thy son am I, teach me thus bowing&amp;rdquo; — Gita. But you well know, Diwanji Saheb, it was my love that prompted me to say so.</description>

      <description>XXI To a Madras disciple
541 DEARBORN AVE.,
CHICAGO,
28 June, 1894.
DEAR__ ,
The other day I received a letter from G. G., Mysore. G. G. unfortunately thinks that I am all-knowing, else he would have written his Canarese address on the top of the letter more legibly. Then again it is a great mistake to address me letters to any other place but Chicago. It was my mistake of course at first, because I ought to have thought of the fine Buddhi (intellect) of our friends who are throwing letters at me anywhere they find an address at the top.</description>

FISHKILL LANDING, N.Y.,

DEAR MOTHER,
I came yesterday to this place, and shall remain here a few days. I received in New York a letter from you but did not receive any Interior, for which I am glad, because I am not perfect yet, and knowing the &amp;ldquo;unselfish love&amp;rdquo; the Presbyterian priests, especially the Interior has for &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;, I want to keep aloof from rousing bad feelings towards these &amp;ldquo;sweet Christian gentlemen&amp;rdquo; in my heart.</description>

DEAR BABIES,
Now don&amp;rsquo;t let my letters stray beyond the circle, please. I had a beautiful letter from sister Mary. See how I am getting the dash, sister Jeany teaches me all that. She can jump and run and play and swear like a devil and talk slang at the rate of 500 a minute; only she does not much care for religion, only a little.</description>

GREENACRE,
11th August, 1894.
DEAR SISTERS,
I have been all this time in Greenacre. I enjoyed this place very much. They have been all very kind to me. One Chicago lady, Mrs. Pratt of Kenilworth, wanted to give me $500; she became so much interested in me; but I refused. She has made me promise that I would send word to her whenever I need money, which I hope the Lord will never put me in.</description>

Forgive me, but I have the right, as your Guru, to advise you, and I insist that you buy some clothes for yourself, as the want of them stands in the way of your doing anything in this country. Once you have a start, you may dress in whatever way you like. People do not object.</description>

HOTEL BELLEVUE,
BEACON ST., BOSTON,
13th September, 1894.
DEAR SISTER,
Your kind note reached me this morning. I have been in this hotel for about a week. I will remain in Boston some time yet. I have plenty of gowns already, in fact, more than I can carry with ease. When I had that drenching in Annisquam, I had on that beautiful black suit you appreciate so much, and I do not think it can be damaged any way; it also has been penetrated with my deep meditations on the Absolute.</description>

      <description>XXIX CHICAGO,
September, 1894.
DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),
Your kind letter reached long ago, but as I had not anything to write I was late in answering.
Your kind note to G. W. Hale has been very gratifying, as I owed them that much. I have been travelling all over this country all this time and seeing everything. I have come to this conclusion that there is only one country in the world which understands religion — it is India; that with all their faults the Hindus are head and shoulders above all other nations in morality and spirituality; and that with proper care and attempt and struggle of all her disinterested sons, by combining some of the active and heroic elements of the West with the calm virtues of the Hindus, there will come a type of men far superior to any that have ever been in this world.</description>

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),
Very kind of you to send up a man inquiring about my health and comfort. But that&amp;rsquo;s quite of a piece with your fatherly character. I am all right here. Your kindness has left nothing more to be desired here. I hope soon to see you in a few days. I don&amp;rsquo;t require any conveyance while going down. Descent is very bad, and the ascent is the worst part of the job, that&amp;rsquo;s the same in everything in the world.</description>

Your letter pleased me extremely. I, of course, understand the joke, but I am not the baby to be put off with a joke; now take more.
The secret of success of the Westerners is the power of organisation and combination. That is only possible with mutual trust and co-operation and help. Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain, whom you well knew in Bombay. This man never takes anything but pure vegetables even in this terribly cold climate, and tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and religion.</description>

54 W. 33RD STREET,
NEW YORK,
24th April, 1895.
DEAR FRIEND,
I am perfectly aware that although some truth underlies the mass of mystical thought which has burst upon the Western world of late, it is for the most part full of motives, unworthy, or insane. For this reason, I have never had anything to do with these phases of religion, either in India or elsewhere, and mystics as a class are not very favourable to me.</description>

I received your last duly, and as I had a previous arrangement to come to Europe by the end of this August, I take your invitation as a Divine Call.
&amp;ldquo;Truth alone triumphs, not untruth. Through truth alone lies the way to Devayāna (the way to the gods).&amp;rdquo; Those who think that a little sugar-coating of untruth helps the spread of truth are mistaken and will find in the long run that a single drop of poison poisons the whole mass.</description>

DEAR BABIES,
What I expected has come. I always thought that although Prof. Max Muller in all his writings on the Hindu religion adds in the last a derogatory remark, he must see the whole truth in the long run. As soon as you can, get a copy of his last book Vedantism; there you will find him swallowing the whole of it — reincarnation and all.</description>

NEW YORK,
June, 1895.
DEAR JOE,
Experiences are gathering a bit thick round you. I am sure they will lift many a veil more.
Mr. Leggett told me of your phonograph. I told him to get a few cylinders — I talk in them through somebody&amp;rsquo;s phonograph and send them to Joe — to which he replied that he could buy one, because &amp;ldquo;I always do what Joe asks me to do.</description>

Going tomorrow to the Thousand Islands care Miss Dutcher&amp;rsquo;s, Thousand Island Park, N.Y. Where are you now? Where will you all be in summer? I have a chance of going to Europe in August, I will come to see you before I go. So write to me. Also I expect books and letters from India.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
The letters from India and the parcel of books reached me safe. I am so happy to know of Mr. Sam&amp;rsquo;s arrival. I am sure he is &amp;ldquo;bewaring of the vidders&amp;rdquo; nicely. I met a friend of Mr. Sam&amp;rsquo;s one day on the street. He is an Englishman with a name ending in &amp;ldquo;ni&amp;rdquo;. He was very nice.</description>

C/O MISS DUTCHER,
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y.
26th June, 1895.
DEAR SISTER,
Many thanks for the Indian mail. It brought a good deal of good news. You are enjoying by this time, I hope, the articles by Prof. Max Müller on the &amp;ldquo;Immortality of the Soul&amp;rdquo; which I sent to Mother Church. The old man has taken in Vedanta, bones and all, and has boldly come out.</description>

C/O MISS DUTCHER,
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y.
26th June, 1895.
DEAR SISTER,
Many thanks for the Indian mail. I cannot express in words my gratitude to you. As you have already read in Max Müller&amp;rsquo;s article on Immortality I sent Mother Church, that he thinks that those we love in this life we must have loved in the past, so it seems I must have belonged to the Holy Family in some past life.</description>

DEAR FRIEND,
Your kind note received today. I am going to Paris first with a friend and start for Europe on the 17th of August. I will however remain in Paris only a week to see my friend married, and then I go over to London.
Your advice about an organisation was very good indeed. And I am trying to act on that line.</description>

19, WEST 38TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
9th August, 1895.
DEAR FRIEND,
. . . It is only just that I should try to give you a little of my views. I fully believe that there are periodic ferments of religion in human society, and that such a period is now sweeping over the educated world. While each ferment, moreover, appears broken into various little bubbles, these are all eventually similar, showing the cause or causes behind them to be the same.</description>

DEAR AND BLESSED FRIEND,
It is useless to express my gratitude for your kindness; it is too great for expression. . . .
I have a cordial invitation from Miss Müller, and as her place is very near to yours, I think it will be nice to come to her place first for a day or two and then to come over to you.</description>

DEAR JOE JOE,
A thousand pardons for not promptly writing to you. I arrived safe in London, found my friend, and am all right in his home. It is beautiful. His wife is surely an angel, and his life is full of India. He has been years there — mixing with the Sannyasins, eating their food, etc.</description>

DEAR FRIEND (Mr. E. T. Sturdy),
Just now two young gentlemen, Mr. Silverlock and his friend, left. Miss Müller also came this afternoon and left just when these gentlemen came in.
One is an Engineer and the other is in the grain trade. They have read a good deal of modern philosophy and science and have been much struck by the similarity with the latest conclusions of both with the ancient Hindu thought.</description>

DEAR FRIEND,
By this time the copies of the lectures must have reached you. Hope they may be of some use.
I think, in the first place, there are so many difficulties to overcome; in the second place, they think that they are fit for nothing — that is the national disease; thirdly, they are afraid to face the winter at once; the Tibet man they don&amp;rsquo;t think is a very strong man to work in England.</description>

Many thanks for your kind New Year&amp;rsquo;s greetings. I am glad to learn you enjoyed your six weeks with the Esq. although they be only golf playing. I have been in the midst of the genuine article in England. The English people received me with open arms, and I have very much toned down my ideas about the English race.</description>

228 WEST 39TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
16th January, 1896.
BLESSED AND BELOVED,
Many many thanks for the books. The Sankhya Karika is a very good book, and the Kurma Purana, though I do not find in it all expected, has a few verses on Yoga. The words dropped in my last letter were Yoga-Sutra, which I am translating with notes from various authorities. I want to incorporate the chapter in Kurma Purana in my notes.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
By this time you must have got enough of matter on Bhakti from me. The last copy, dated 21st December, of Brahmavadin is in. I have been smelling something since the last few issues of the Brahmavadin. Are you going to join the Theosophists? This time you simply gave yourselves up. Why, you get in a notice of the Theosophists&amp;rsquo; lectures in the body of your notes!</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED,
I am coming before May if possible. You need not worry about that. The pamphlet was beautiful. The newspaper cuttings from here will be forwarded if we can get them.
The books and pamphlets here have been got up this way. A committee was formed in New York. They paid all the expenses of stenographing and printing on condition the books will belong to them.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED,
I received your last just now and it frightened me immensely.
The lectures were delivered under the auspices of certain friends who paid for the stenography and all other expenses on condition they alone will have the right to publish them. As such, they have already published the Sunday lectures as well as three books on &amp;ldquo;Karma-Yoga&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raja-Yoga&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Jnana-Yoga&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
I am afraid you are offended and did not answer any of my letters. Now I beg a hundred thousand pardons. By very good luck, I have found the orange cloth and am going to have a coat made as soon as I can. I am glad to hear you met Mrs. Bull. She is such a noble lady and kind friend. Now, sister, there are two very thin Sanskrit pamphlets in the house.</description>

DEAR SISTERS,
Greetings to you from the other shore. The voyage has been pleasant and no sickness this time. I gave myself treatment to avoid it. I made quite a little run through Ireland and some of the Old English towns and now am once more in Reading amidst Brahma and Maya and Jiva, the individual and the universal soul, etc.</description>

DEAR MARY,
Your letter reached just now. Of course, you were not jealous but all of a sudden were inspired with sympathy for poor India. Well, you need not be frightened. Wrote a letter to Mother Church weeks ago, but have not been able to get a line from her yet. I am afraid the whole party have taken orders and entered a Catholic convent — four old maids are enough to drive any mother to a convent.</description>

LONDON,

DEAR BABIES,
The work here progressed wonderfully. I had one monk here from India. I have sent him to the U.S.A. and sent for another from India. The season is closed; the classes, therefore, and the Sunday lectures are to be closed on the 16th next. And on the 19th I go for a month or so for quiet and rest in the Swiss Mountains to return next autumn to London and begin again.</description>

. . . I am reading a little, starving a good deal, and practising a good deal more. The strolls in the woods are simply delicious. We are now situated under three huge glaciers, and the scenery is very beautiful.
By the by, whatever scruples I may have had as to the Swiss-lake origin of the Aryans have been taken clean off my mind.</description>

LXXX To Kripananda
SWITZERLAND,
August, 1896.
DEAR—,
Be you holy and, above all, sincere; and do not for a moment give up your trust in the Lord, and you will see the light. Whatever is truth will remain for ever; whatever is not, none can preserve. We are helped in being born in a time when everything is quickly searched out. Whatever others think or do, lower not your standard of purity, morality, and love of God; above all, beware of all secret organisations.</description>

DEAR GOODWIN,
I am now taking rest. I read from different letters a lot about Kripananda. I am sorry for him. There must be something wrong in his head. Let him alone. None of you need bother about him.
As for hurting me, that is not in the power of gods or devils. So be at rest. It is unswerving love and perfect unselfishness that conquer everything.</description>

Today I received a letter from America, which I send to you. I have written them that my idea of course is concentration, at least for the present beginning. I have also suggested them that instead of having too many papers, they may start by putting in a few sheets in The Brahmavadin — written in America — and raise the subscription a little which will cover the American expenses.</description>

KIEL,
10th September, 1896.
DEAR FRIEND,
I have at last seen Prof. Deussen. . . . The whole of yesterday was spent very nicely with the Professor, sight-seeing and discussing about the Vedanta.
He is what I should call &amp;ldquo;a warring Advaitist&amp;rdquo;. No compromise with anything else. &amp;ldquo;Ishwara&amp;rdquo; is his bug-bear. He would have none of it if he could. He is very much delighted with the idea of your magazine and wants to confer with you on these subjects in London, where he is shortly going.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
Today I reached London, after my two months of climbing and walking and glacier seeing in Switzerland. One good it has done me — a few pounds of unnecessary adipose tissue have returned back to the gaseous state. Well, there is no safety even in that, for the solid body of this birth has taken a fancy to outstrip the mind towards infinite expansion.</description>

DEAR RAKHAL,
As you see, by this time I am on my way. Before leaving London, I got your letter and the pamphlet. Take no heed of Mazoomdar&amp;rsquo;s madness. He surely has gone crazy with jealousy.

DEAR MARY,
I received your letter forwarded from London in Rome. It was very very kind of you to write such a beautiful letter, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I do not know anything about the evolution of the orchestra in Europe. We are nearing Port Said after four days of frightfully bad sailing from Naples.

MADRAS,

DEAR RAKHAL,
I am to start by S.S. Mombasa next Sunday. I had to give up invitations from Poona and other places on account of bad health. I am very much pulled down by hard work and heat.
The Theosophists and others wanted to intimidate me. Therefore I had to give them a bit of my mind. You know they persecuted me all the time in America, because I did not join them.</description>

DEAR SHASHI,
All of you have doubtless reached Madras by this time. I should think Biligiri is certainly taking great care of you, and that Sadananda serves you as your attendant. In Madras the worship should be done in a completely Sattvic manner, without a trace of Rajas in it. I hope Alasinga has by now returned to Madras.</description>

ALAMBAZAR MATH,
CALCUTTA,
5th May, 1897.
MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,
Your very very kind, loving, and encouraging letter gave me more strength than you think of.
There are moments when one feels entirely despondent, no doubt — especially when one has worked towards an ideal during a whole life&amp;rsquo;s time and just when there is a bit of hope of seeing it partially accomplished, there comes a tremendous thwarting blow.</description>

      <description>XCII (Translated from Bengali )
To Swami Brahmananda
ALMORA,
20th May, 1897.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
From your letter I got all the important news. I got a letter from Sudhir also and also one from Master Mahashay. I have also got two letters from Nityananda (Yogen Chatterjee) from the famine areas.
Even now money is floating on the waters, as it were, . . . but it will surely come. When it comes, buildings, land, and a permanent fund — everything will come all right.</description>

20th May, 1897.
DEAR SUDHIR,
Your letter gave me much pleasure. One thing, perhaps, I forget to tell you — to keep a copy of the letter you sent me. Also all important communications to the Math from different persons and to different persons should be copied and preserved.
I am very glad to learn that things are going on well, that the work there is steadily progressing as well as that of Calcutta.</description>

XCIV To Marie Halboister
ALMORA,
2nd June, 1897.
DEAR MARIE,
I begin here my promised big chatty letter with the best intention as to its growth, and if it fails, it will be owing to your own Karma. I am sure you are enjoying splendid health. I have been very, very bad indeed; now recovering a bit — hope to recover very soon.
What about the work in London?</description>

ALMORA,

MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,
. . . Let me tell you plainly. Every word you write I value, and every letter is welcome a hundred times. Write whenever you have a mind and opportunity, and whatever you like, knowing that nothing will be misinterpreted, nothing unappreciated. I have not had any news of the work for so long. Can you tell me anything?</description>

ALMORA,
4th July, 1897.
MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,
I am being played upon curiously by both good and evil influences from London these times here. . . . On the other hand, your letters are full of life and sunshine, and bring strength and hope to my spirits, and they sadly want these now. God knows.
Although I am still in the Himalayas, and shall be here for at least a month more, I started the work in Calcutta before I came, and they write progress every week.</description>

ALMORA,

MY DEAR JOE JOE,
I am glad to learn that you have at last found out that I have time to read your letters.
I have taken to the Himalayas, tired of lecturing and orating. I am so sorry the doctors would not allow my going over with the Raja of Khetri to England, and that has made Sturdy mad.
The Seviers are at Simla and Miss Müller here in Almora.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Going to Almora from here I made special efforts for Yogen. But he left for the plains as soon as he had recovered a little. From Subhala valley he will write to me of his safe arrival there. As it is impossible to procure a Dandi (a carrying chair) or any other conveyance, Latu could not go.</description>

MY DEAR MARIE,
I have time, will, and opportunity now to clear my promise. So my letter begins. I have been very weak for some time, and with that and other things my visit to England this Jubilee season had to be postponed.
I was very sorry at first not to be able to meet my nice and very dear friends once more, but Karma cannot be avoided, and I had to rest contented with my Himalayas.</description>

DEAR SHASHI,
I got information that your work there is going on very well. Get a thorough mastery of the three Bhāshyas (commentaries), and also study well European philosophy and allied subjects — see to it without fail. To fight with others one requires sword and shield — this fact should never be forgotten. I hope Sukul has now reached there and is attending on you all right.</description>

DEAR SHASHI,
I am very much pained to hear that the work in Madras is not prospering for want of funds. I am glad to learn that the amount borrowed by Alasinga&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law (sister&amp;rsquo;s husband) has been received back in Almora. Goodwin has written to me to inform the Reception Committee to take some money for expenses from the amount that is left as a result of the lecture.</description>

AMRITSAR,
2nd September, 1897.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Yogen tells me in a letter to buy the house at Baghbazar for Rs. 20,000. Even if we buy that house, there are still a lot of difficulties; for example, we shall have to break it down in part and make the drawing room into a big hall, and similar alterations and repairs. Moreover the house is very old and ramshackle.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Now Kashmir. The excellent accounts you heard of this place are all true. There is no place so beautiful as this; and the people also are fair and good-looking, though their eyes are not beautiful. But I have also never seen elsewhere villages and towns so horribly dirty. In Srinagar I am now putting up at the house of Rishibar Babu.</description>

MY DEAR SHUDDHANANDA,
We are in Kashmir at last. I need not tell you of all the beauties of the place. It is the one land fit for Yogis, to my mind. But the land is now inhabited by a race who though possessing great physical beauty are extremely dirty. I am going to travel by water for a month seeing the sights and getting strong.</description>

2. Most of the monks are educated.</description>

I understand from a letter of Gopal Dada that you have seen that piece of land at Konnagar. It seems that that site is rent-free and measures 16 bighas (about 5 acres), and that the price is below eight or ten thousand rupees. Do what you think best after considering the healthiness and other factors. In a day or two I shall leave for the Punjab.</description>

1st October, 1897.
DEAR MARGO,
Some people do the best work when led. Not every one is born to lead. The best leader, however, is one who &amp;ldquo;leads like the baby&amp;rdquo;. The baby, though apparently depending on everyone, is the king of the household. At least, to my thinking, that is the secret. . . . Many feel, but only a few can express. It is the power of expressing one&amp;rsquo;s love and appreciation and sympathy for others, that enables one person to succeed better in spreading the idea than others.</description>

Now Babu Raghunath Bhattacharya of Tehri is suffering very much from some pain in the neck; I also have been suffering for a long time from some pain at the back of my neck.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Part of the money that Miss Müller promised has reached Calcutta. The balance will come afterwards in a short while. We have also some amount. Miss Müller will deposit the money in your name as well as mine with Messrs. Grindlay &amp;amp; Co. As you have got the power of attorney, you alone can draw all the money.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
We shall start for Khetri tomorrow. Gradually the luggage has greatly increased. After Khetri I intend to send everybody to the Math. I could get done through them none of the work which I had hoped. That is to say, it is quite certain that none of them can do anything if he always remains with me.</description>

MY DEAR SHIVANANDA,
Mr. Setlur of Girgaon, Bombay, whom you know very well from Madras writes to me to send somebody to Africa to look after the religious needs of the Indian emigrants in Africa. He will of course send the man and bear all expenses.
The work will not be congenial at present, I am afraid, but it is really the work for a perfect man.</description>

You have news of me already, I hope, through the letter I wrote to Mother Church. You are all so kind, the whole family, to me, I must have belonged to you in the past, as we Hindus say.

I was down with fever brought upon, perhaps, by excessive mountain climbing and the bad health in the station.
I am better today and intend leaving this in a day or two. In spite of the great heat there, I used to sleep well in Calcutta and had some appetite. Here both have vanished — this is all the gain.</description>

You are always under a delusion, and it does not leave you because of the strong influence, good or bad, of other brains. It is this: whenever I write to you about accounts, you feel that I have no confidence in you. . . .

MY DEAR MARY,
I could not make an earlier opportunity of writing you, and knowing that you were in no hurry for a letter, I will not make apologies. You are learning all about Kashmir and ourselves from Miss MacLeod&amp;rsquo;s letter to Mrs. Leggett, I hear — therefore needless going into long rigmaroles about it.
The search for Heinsholdt&amp;rsquo;s Mahatmas in Kashmir will be entirely fruitless; and as the whole thing has first to be established as coming from a creditable source, the attempt will also be a little too early.</description>

RIDGELY MANOR,
4th September, 1899.
MY DEAR MOTHER,
It is an awful spell of the bad turn of fortune with me last six months. Misfortune follows me ever wherever I go. In England, Sturdy seems to have got disgusted with the work; he does not see any asceticism in us from India. Here no sooner I reach than Olea gets a bad attack.
Shall I run up to you?</description>

      <description>CXLII To Mr. E. T. Sturdy
RIDGELY MANOR,
14th September, 1899.
MY DEAR STURDY,
I have simply been taking rest at the Leggetts&amp;rsquo; and doing nothing. Abhedananda is here. He has been working hard.
He goes in a day or two to resume his work in different places for a month. After that he comes to New York to work.
I am trying to do something in the line you suggested, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how far an account of the Hindus will be appreciated by the Western public when it comes from a Hindu.</description>

      <description>CXLIII To Miss Mary Hale
RIDGELY MANOR,
September 1899.
MY DEAR MARY,
Yes, I have arrived. I had a letter from Isabelle from Greenacre. I hope to see her soon and Harriet. Harriet Woolley has been uniformly silent. Never mind, I will bide my time, and as soon as Mr. Woolley becomes a millionaire, demand my money. You did not write any particulars about Mother Church and Father Pope, only the news of something about me in some newspapers.</description>

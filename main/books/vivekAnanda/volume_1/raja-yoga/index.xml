      <description>RAJA-YOGA
PREFACE Since the dawn of history, various extraordinary phenomena have been recorded as happening amongst human beings. Witnesses are not wanting in modern times to attest to the fact of such events, even in societies living under the full blaze of modern science. The vast mass of such evidence is unreliable, as coming from ignorant, superstitious, or fraudulent persons. In many instances the so-called miracles are imitations. But what do they imitate?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY All our knowledge is based upon experience. What we call inferential knowledge, in which we go from the less to the more general, or from the general to the particular, has experience as its basis. In what are called the exact sciences, people easily find the truth, because it appeals to the particular experiences of every human being. The scientist does not tell you to believe in anything, but he has certain results which come from his own experiences, and reasoning on them when he asks us to believe in his conclusions, he appeals to some universal experience of humanity.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE FIRST STEPS Rāja-Yoga is divided into eight steps. The first is Yama — non-killing, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-receiving of any gifts. Next is Niyama — cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study, and self-surrender to God. Then comes Âsana, or posture; Prānāyāma, or control of Prāna; Pratyāhāra, or restraint of the senses from their objects; Dhāranā, or fixing the mind on a spot; Dhyāna, or meditation; and Samādhi, or superconsciousness.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
PRANA Prānāyāma is not, as many think, something about breath; breath indeed has very little to do with it, if anything. Breathing is only one of the many exercises through which we get to the real Pranayama. Pranayama means the control of Prāna. According to the philosophers of India, the whole universe is composed of two materials, one of which they call Âkāsha. It is the omnipresent, all-penetrating existence.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE PSYCHIC PRANA According to the Yogis, there are two nerve currents in the spinal column, called Pingalā and Idā, and a hollow canal called Sushumnā running through the spinal cord. At the lower end of the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the &amp;ldquo;Lotus of the Kundalini&amp;rdquo;. They describe it as triangular in form in which, in the symbolical language of the Yogis, there is a power called the Kundalini, coiled up.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
THE CONTROL OF PSYCHIC PRANA We have now to deal with the exercises in Prānāyāma. We have seen that the first step, according to the Yogis, is to control the motion of the lungs. What we want to do is to feel the finer motions that are going on in the body. Our minds have become externalised, and have lost sight of the fine motions inside. If we can begin to feel them, we can begin to control them.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
PRATYAHARA AND DHARANA The next step is called Pratyāhāra. What is this? You know how perceptions come. First of all there are the external instruments, then the internal organs acting in the body through the brain centres, and there is the mind. When these come together and attach themselves to some external object, then we perceive it. At the same time it is a very difficult thing to concentrate the mind and attach it to one organ only; the mind is a slave.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
DHYANA AND SAMADHI We have taken a cursory view of the different steps in Rāja-Yoga, except the finer ones, the training in concentration, which is the goal to which Raja-Yoga will lead us. We see, as human beings, that all our knowledge which is called rational is referred to consciousness. My consciousness of this table, and of your presence, makes me know that the table and you are here.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
RAJA-YOGA IN BRIEF The following is a summary of Rāja-Yoga freely translated from the Kurma-Purāna.
The fire of Yoga burns the cage of sin that is around a man. Knowledge becomes purified and Nirvāna is directly obtained. From Yoga comes knowledge; knowledge again helps the Yogi. He who combines in himself both Yoga and knowledge, with him the Lord is pleased. Those that practice Mahāyoga, either once a day, or twice a day, or thrice, or always, know them to be gods.</description>

      <description>PATANJALI&amp;rsquo;S YOGA APHORISMS
INTRODUCTION Before going into the Yoga aphorisms I shall try to discuss one great question, upon which rests the whole theory of religion for the Yogis. It seems the consensus of opinion of the great minds of the world, and it has been nearly demonstrated by researches into physical nature, that we are the outcome and manifestation of an absolute condition, back of our present relative condition, and are going forward, to return to that absolute.</description>

      <description>PATANJALI&amp;rsquo;S YOGA APHORISMS
CHAPTER I
CONCENTRATION: ITS SPIRITUAL USES अथ योगानुशासनम् ॥१॥
1. Now concentration is explained.
योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥२॥
2. Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Chitta) from taking various forms (Vrittis).
A good deal of explanation is necessary here. We have to understand what Chitta is, and what the Vrittis are. I have eyes. Eyes do not see. Take away the brain centre which is in the head, the eyes will still be there, the retinae complete, as also the pictures of objects on them, and yet the eyes will not see.</description>

CHAPTER II
CONCENTRATION: ITS PRACTICE तपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि क्रियायोगः ॥१॥
1. Mortification, study, and surrendering fruits of work to God are called Kriyā-yoga.
Those Samādhis with which we ended our last chapter are very difficult to attain; so we must take them up slowly. The first step, the preliminary step, is called Kriya-yoga. Literally this means work, working towards Yoga. The organs are the horses, the mind is the rein, the intellect is the charioteer, the soul is the rider, and the body is the chariot.</description>

CHAPTER III
POWERS We have now come to the chapter in which the Yoga powers are described.
देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥१॥
1. Dhāranā is holding the mind on to some particular object.
Dharana (concentration) is when the mind holds on to some object, either in the body, or outside the body, and keeps itself in that state.
तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥२॥
2. An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is Dhyāna.</description>

      <description>PATANJALI&amp;rsquo;S YOGA APHORISMS
CHAPTER IV
INDEPENDENCE जन्मौषधि-मन्त्र-तपः-समाधिजाः सिद्धयः ॥१॥
1. The Siddhis (powers) are attained by birth, chemical means, power of words, mortification, or concentration.
Sometimes a man is born with the Siddhis, powers, of course, those he had earned in his previous incarnation. This time he is born, as it were, to enjoy the fruits of them. It is said of Kapila, the great father of the Sānkhya philosophy, that he was a born Siddha, which means literally a man who has attained to success.</description>

CHAPTER II
अग्निर्यत्राभिमथ्यते वायुर्यत्राधिरुध्यते ।
सोमो यत्रातिरिच्यते तत्र सञ्जायते मनः ॥६॥
6. Where the fire is rubbed, where the air is controlled, where the Soma flows over, there a (perfect) mind is created.
त्रिरुन्नतं स्थाप्य समं शरीरं
हृदीन्द्रियाणि मनसा सन्निवेश्य ।
ब्रह्मोडुपेन प्रतरेत विद्वान्
स्रोतांसि सर्वाणि भयानकानि ॥८॥
8. Placing the body in a straight posture, with the chest, the throat and the head held erect, making the organs enter the mind, the sage crosses all the fearful currents by means of the raft of Brahman.</description>

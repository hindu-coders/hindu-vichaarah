VENGEANCE OF HISTORY
(Mrs. Wright)
[At the end of August 1893, Swami Vivekananda stayed at Annisquam at the house of Prof. J. H. Wright. So astonishing a sight did Swamiji present in this quiet little New England village that speculations set in at once as to who this majestic and colourful figure might be. From where had he come? At first they decided that he was a Brahmin from India, but his manners did not fully conform to their ideas.</description>

RELIGION, CIVILISATION, AND MIRACLES
(The Appeal-Avalanche)
&amp;ldquo;I am a monk,&amp;rdquo; he said, as he sat in the parlors of La Salette Academy, (On January 21, 1894.) which is his home while in Memphis, &amp;ldquo;and not a priest. When at home I travel from place to place, teaching the people of the villages and towns through which I pass. I am dependent upon them for my sustenance, as I am not allowed to touch money.</description>

(The Detroit Free Press, February 14, 1894)
Swami is a person of medium stature, with the dusky complexion common with people of his nationality, gentle in manner, deliberate in movement, and extremely courteous in every word, movement, and gesture. But the most striking feature of his personality are his eyes, which are of great brilliancy. The conversation naturally drifted upon the subject of religion, when Swami said among many other striking remarks:</description>

FALLEN WOMEN
(The Detroit Tribune, March 17, 1894)
&amp;ldquo;Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was her very great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve, as everyone knows. In the West people say rude things about Lalun&amp;rsquo;s profession and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that morality may be preserved. In the East, where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice.</description>

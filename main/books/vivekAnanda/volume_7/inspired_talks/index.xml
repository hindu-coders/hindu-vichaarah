      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) WEDNESDAY, June 19, 1895.
(This day marks the beginning of the regular teaching given daily by Swami Vivekananda to his disciples at Thousand Island Park. We had not yet all assembled there, but the Master&amp;rsquo;s heart was always in his work, so he commenced at once to teach the three or four who were with him. He came on this first morning with the Bible in his hand and opened to the Book of John, saying that since we were all Christians, it was proper that he should begin with the Christian scriptures.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SUNDAY, June 23, 1895.
Be brave and be sincere; then follow any path with devotion, and you must reach the Whole. Once lay hold of one link of the chain, and the whole chain must come by degrees. Water the roots of the tree (that is, reach the Lord), and the whole tree is watered; getting the Lord, we get all.
One-sidedness is the bane of the world.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) MONDAY, June 24, 1895. (The reading today was from the Bhakti-Sutras by Nārada.)
&amp;ldquo;Extreme love to God is Bhakti, and this love is the real immortality, getting which a man becomes perfectly satisfied, sorrows for no loss, and is never jealous; knowing which man becomes mad.&amp;rdquo;
My Master used to say, &amp;ldquo;This world is a huge lunatic asylum where all men are mad, some after money, some after women, some after name or fame, and a few after God.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, June 25, 1895.
After every happiness comes misery; they may be far apart or near. The more advanced the soul, the more quickly does one follow the other. What we want is neither happiness nor misery. Both make us forget our true nature; both are chains — one iron, one gold; behind both is the Atman, who knows neither happiness nor misery.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) WEDNESDAY, June 26, 1895.
Our best work is done, our greatest influence is exerted, when we are without thought of self. All great geniuses know this. Let us open ourselves to the one Divine Actor, and let Him act, and do nothing ourselves. &amp;ldquo;O Arjuna! I have no duty in the whole world&amp;rdquo;, says Krishna. Be perfectly resigned, perfectly unconcerned; then alone can you do any true work.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) THURSDAY, June 27, 1895. (The Swami brought the New Testament this morning and talked again on the book of John.)
Mohammed claimed to be the &amp;ldquo;Comforter&amp;rdquo; that Christ promised to send. He considered it unnecessary to claim a supernatural birth for Jesus. Such claims have been common in all ages and in all countries. All great men have claimed gods for their fathers.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) FRIDAY, June 28, 1895. (The entire party went on a picnic for the day, and although the Swami taught constantly, as he did wherever he was, no notes were taken and no record, therefore, of what he said remains. As he began his breakfast before setting out, however, he remarked:)
Be thankful for all food, it is Brahman. His universal energy is transmuted into our individual energy and helps us in all that we do.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, June 29, 1895. (The Swami came this morning with a Gita in his hand.)
Krishna, the &amp;ldquo;Lord of souls&amp;rdquo;, talks to Arjuna or Gudākesha, &amp;ldquo;lord of sleep&amp;rdquo; (he who has conquered sleep). The &amp;ldquo;field of virtue&amp;rdquo; (the battlefield) is this world; the five brothers (representing righteousness) fight the hundred other brothers (all that we love and have to contend against); the most heroic brother, Arjuna (the awakened soul), is the general.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SUNDAY, June 30, 1895.
To try to think without a phantasm is to try to make the impossible possible. We cannot think &amp;ldquo;mammalia&amp;rdquo; without a concrete example. So with the idea of God.
The great abstraction of ideas in the world is what we call God.
Each thought has two parts — the thinking and the word; and we must have both. Neither idealists nor materialists are right; we must take both idea and expression.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) MONDAY, July 1, 1895. (Shri Ramakrishna Deva)
Shri Ramakrishna was the son of a very orthodox Brahmin, who would refuse even a gift from any but a special caste of Brahmins; neither might he work, nor even be a priest in a temple, nor sell books, nor serve anyone. He could only have &amp;ldquo;what fell from the skies&amp;rdquo; (alms), and even then it must not come through a &amp;ldquo;fallen&amp;rdquo; Brahmin.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, July 2, 1895. (The Divine Mother.)
Shāktas worship the Universal Energy as Mother, the sweetest name they know; for the mother is the highest ideal of womanhood in India. When God is worshipped as &amp;ldquo;Mother&amp;rdquo;, as Love, the Hindus call it the &amp;ldquo;right-handed&amp;rdquo; way, and it leads to spirituality but never to material prosperity. When God is worshipped on His terrible side, that is, in the &amp;ldquo;left-handed&amp;rdquo; way, it leads usually to great material prosperity, but rarely to spirituality; and eventually it leads to degeneration and the obliteration of the race that practices it.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) WEDNESDAY, July 3, 1895.
Generally speaking, human religion begins with fear. &amp;ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&amp;rdquo; But later comes the higher idea. &amp;ldquo;Perfect love casteth out fear.&amp;rdquo; Traces of fear will remain with us until we get knowledge, know what God is. Christ, being man, had to see impurity and denounced it; but God, infinitely higher, does not see iniquity and cannot be angry.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) FRIDAY, July 5, 1895.
Until you are ready to change any minute, you can never see the truth; but you must hold fast and be steady in the search for truth. . . .
Chārvākas, a very ancient sect in India, were rank materialists. They have died out now, and most of their books are lost. They claimed that the soul, being the product of the body and its forces, died with it; that there was no proof of its further existence.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, July 6, 1895. (Today we had Shankaracharya&amp;rsquo;s commentary on Vyāsa&amp;rsquo;s Vedānta Sutras.)
Om tat sat! According to Shankara, there are two phases of the universe, one is I and the other thou; and they are as contrary as light and darkness, so it goes without saying that neither can be derived from the other. On the subject, the object has been superimposed; the subject is the only reality, the other a mere appearance.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SUNDAY MORNING, July 7, 1895.
Infinite manifestation dividing itself in portion still remains infinite, and each portion is infinite.1
Brahman is the same in two forms — changeable and unchangeable, expressed and unexpressed. Know that the Knower and the known are one. The Trinity — the Knower, the known, and knowing — is manifesting as this universe. That God the Yogi sees in meditation, he sees through the power of his own Self.</description>

There is no place for reasoning in Madhva&amp;rsquo;s explanation, it is all taken from the revelation in the Vedas.
Ramanuja says, the Vedas are the holiest study. Let the sons of the three upper castes get the Sutra (The holy thread.) and at eight, ten, or eleven years of age begin the study, which means going to a Guru and learning the Vedas word for word, with perfect intonation and pronunciation.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, July 9, 1895.
Man as Atman is really free; as man he is bound, changed by every physical condition. As man, he is a machine with an idea of freedom; but this human body is the best and the human mind the highest mind there is. When a man attains to the Atman state, he can take a body, making it to suit himself; he is above law.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) WEDNESDAY, July 10, 1895.
There are sixty-five million Mohammedans in India, some of them Sufis.1 Sufis identify man with God, and through them this idea came into Europe. They say, &amp;ldquo;I am that Truth&amp;rdquo;; but they have an esoteric as well as an exoteric doctrine, although Mohammed himself did not hold it.
&amp;ldquo;Hashshashin&amp;quot;2 has become our word &amp;ldquo;assassin&amp;rdquo;, because an old sect of Mohammedanism killed nonbelievers as a part of its creed.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) THURSDAY, July 11, 1895.
Without mother-love no creation could continue. Nothing is entirely physical, nor yet entirely metaphysical; one presupposes the other and explains the other. All Theists agree that there is a background to this visible universe, they differ as to the nature or character of that background. Materialists say there is no background.
In all religions the superconscious state is identical.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) FRIDAY, July 12, 1895. (Shankara&amp;rsquo;s Commentary.)
Fourth Vyasa Sutra. &amp;ldquo;Âtman (is) the aim of all.&amp;rdquo;
Ishvara is to be known from the Vedanta; all Vedas point to Him (Who is the Cause; the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer). Ishvara is the unification of the Trinity, known as Brahmā, Vishnu, and Shiva, which stand at the head of the Hindu Pantheon. &amp;ldquo;Thou art our Father who takest us to the other shore of the dark ocean&amp;rdquo; (Disciple&amp;rsquo;s words to the Master).</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, July 13th, 1895.
Everything we know is a compound, and all sense-knowledge comes through analysis. To think that mind is a simple, single, or independent is dualism. Philosophy is not got by studying books; the more you read books, the more muddled becomes the mind. The idea of unthinking philosophers was that the mind was a simple, and this led them to believe in free-will.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SUNDAY, July 14, 1895.
Philosophy in India means that through which we see God, the rationale of religion; so no Hindu could ever ask for a link between religion and philosophy.
Concrete, generalised, abstract are the three stages in the process of philosophy. The highest abstraction in which all things agree is the One. In religion we have first, symbols and forms; next, mythologies; and last, philosophy.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) MONDAY, July 15, 1895.
Where there is polyandry, as in Tibet, women are physically stronger than the men. When the English go there, these women carry large men up the mountains.
In Malabar, although of course polyandry does not obtain there, the women lead in everything. Exceptional cleanliness is apparent everywhere and there is the greatest impetus to learning. When I myself was in that country, I met many women who spoke good Sanskrit, while in the rest of India not one woman in a million can speak it.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, July 16, 1895. (Shankara)
The &amp;ldquo;unseen cause&amp;rdquo; (Or mass of subtle impressions.) leads us to sacrifice and worship, which in turn produce seen results; but to attain liberation we must first hear, then think or reason, and then meditate upon Brahman.
The result of works and the result of knowledge are two different things. &amp;ldquo;Do&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do not do&amp;rdquo; are the background of all morality, but they really belong only to the body and the mind.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) WEDNESDAY, July 17, 1895.
Rāmānuja divides the universe into Chit, Achit, and Ishvara — man, nature, and God; conscious, subconscious, and superconscious. Shankara, on the contrary, says that Chit, the soul, is the same as God. God is truth, is knowledge, is infinity; these are not qualities. Any thought of God is a qualification, and all that can be said of Him is &amp;ldquo;Om tat sat&amp;rdquo;.</description>

(The lesson today was mainly Shankara&amp;rsquo;s argument against the conclusion of the Sānkhya philosophy.)
The Sankhyas say that consciousness is a compound, and beyond that, the last analysis gives us the Purusha, Witness, but that there are many Purushas — each of us is one. Advaita, on the contrary, affirms that Purushas can be only One, that Purusha cannot be conscious, unconscious, or have any qualification, for either these qualities would bind, or they would eventually cease; so the One must be without any qualities, even knowledge, and It cannot be the cause of the universe or of anything.</description>

So long as I say &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo;, I have the right to speak of God protecting us. When I see another, I must take all the consequences and put in the third, the ideal, which stands between us; that is the apex of the triangle. The vapour becomes snow, then water, then Ganga; but when it is vapour, there is no Ganga, and when it is water, we think of no vapour in it.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, July 20, 1895.
Perception is our only real knowledge or religion. Talking about it for ages will never make us know our soul. There is no difference between theories and atheism. In fact, the atheist is the truer man. Every step I take in the light is mine for ever. When you go to a country and see it, then it is yours.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SUNDAY, July 21, 1895. (Patanjali&amp;rsquo;s Yoga Aphorisms)
Yoga is the science of restraining the Chitta (mind) from breaking into Vrittis (modifications). Mind is a mixture of sensation and feelings, or action and reaction; so it cannot be permanent. The mind has a fine body and through this it works on the gross body. Vedanta says that behind the mind is the real Self.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, July 23, 1895. (Bhagavad-Gita, Karma-Yoga)
To attain liberation through work, join yourself to work but without desire, looking for no result. Such work leads to knowledge, which in turn brings emancipation. To give up work before you know, leads to misery. Work done for the Self gives no bondage. Neither desire pleasure nor fear pain from work. It is the mind and body that work, not I.</description>

The powers acquired by the practice of Yoga are not obstacles for the Yogi who is perfect, but are apt to be so for the beginner, through the wonder and pleasure excited by their exercise. Siddhis are the powers which mark success in the practice; and they may be produced by various means, such as the repetition of a Mantra, by Yoga practice, meditation, fasting, or even by the use of herbs and drugs.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) THURSDAY, July 25, 1895. (Patanjali&amp;rsquo;s Yoga Aphorisms)
&amp;ldquo;Things may be done, caused to be done, or approved of&amp;rdquo;, and the effect upon us is nearly equal.
Complete continence gives great intellectual and spiritual power. The Brahmachārin must be sexually pure in thought, word, and deed. Lose regard for the body; get rid of the consciousness of it so far as possible.
Âsana (posture) must be steady and pleasant; and constant practice, identifying the mind with the Infinite, will bring this about.</description>

Love all things only through and for the Self. Yājnavalkya said to Maitreyi, his wife, &amp;ldquo;Through the Atman we know all things.&amp;rdquo; The Atman can never be the object of knowledge, nor can the Knower be known. He who knows he is the Atman, he is law unto himself. He knows he is the universe and its creator.</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, July 27, 1895. (Kathopanishad)
Learn not the truth of the Self save from one who has realised it; in all others it is mere talk. Realisation is beyond virtue and vice, beyond future and past; beyond all the pairs of opposites. &amp;ldquo;The stainless one sees the Self, and an eternal calm comes in the Soul.&amp;rdquo; Talking, arguing, and reading books, the highest flights of the intellect, the Vedas themselves, all these cannot give knowledge of the Self.</description>

We sometimes indicate a thing by describing its surroundings. When we say &amp;ldquo;Sachchidananda&amp;rdquo; (Existence-Knowledge-Bliss), we are merely indicating the shores of an indescribable Beyond. Not even can we say &amp;ldquo;is&amp;rdquo; about it, for that too is relative. Any imagination, any concept is in vain. Neti, neti (&amp;ldquo;Not this, not this&amp;rdquo;) is all that can be said, for even to think is to limit and so to lose.</description>

Christs and Buddhas are simply occasions upon which to objectify our own inner powers. We really answer our own prayers.
It is blasphemy to think that if Jesus had never been born, humanity would not have been saved. It is horrible to forget thus the divinity in human nature, a divinity that must come out. Never forget the glory of human nature.</description>

Luther drove a nail into religion when he took away renunciation and gave us morality instead. Atheists and materialists can have ethics, but only believers in the Lord can have religion.
The wicked pay the price of the great soul&amp;rsquo;s holiness. Think of that when you see a wicked man. Just as the poor man&amp;rsquo;s labour pays for the rich man&amp;rsquo;s luxury, so is it in the spiritual world.</description>

The real Guru is the one through whom we have our spiritual descent. He is the channel through which the spiritual current flows to us, the link which joins us to the whole spiritual world. Too much faith in personality has a tendency to produce weakness and idolatry, but intense love for the Guru makes rapid growth possible, he connects us with the internal Guru.</description>

Individuals who are to get freedom in this life have to live thousands of years in one lifetime. They have to be ahead of their times, but the masses can only crawl. Thus we have Christs and Buddhas. . . .
There was once a Hindu queen, who so much desired that all her children should attain freedom in this life that she herself took all the care of them; and as she rocked them to sleep, she sang always the one song to them — &amp;ldquo;Tat tvam asi, Tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;That thou art, That thou art&amp;rdquo;).</description>

&amp;ldquo;Whom the ignorant worship, Him I preach unto thee.&amp;rdquo;
This one and only God is the &amp;ldquo;knownest&amp;rdquo; of the known. He is the one thing we see everywhere. All know their own Self, all know, &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;, even animals. All we know is the projection of the Self. Teach this to the children, they can grasp it. Every religion has worshipped the Self, even though unconsciously, because there is nothing else.</description>

The question is: Is it necessary to pass through all the lower stages to reach the highest, or can a plunge be taken at once? The modern American boy takes twenty-five years to attain that which his forefathers took hundreds of years to do.

Without the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; there can be no &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; outside. From this some philosophers came to the conclusion that the external world did not exist save in the subject; that the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; existed only in the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. Others have argued that the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; can only be known through the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; and with equal logic. These two views are partial truths, each wrong in part and each right in part.</description>

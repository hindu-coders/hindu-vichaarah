      <description>ON ART In art, interest must be centred on the principal theme. Drama is the most difficult of all arts. In it two things are to be satisfied — first, the ears, and second, the eyes. To paint a scene, if one thing be painted, it is easy enough; but to paint different things and yet to keep up the central interest is very difficult. Another difficult thing is stage-management, that is, combining different things in such a manner as to keep the central interest intact.</description>

      <title>726 ON MUSIC</title>

      <description>ON MUSIC There is science in Dhrupad, Kheyal, etc., but it is in Kirtana, i.e. in Māthura and Viraha and other like compositions that there is real music — for there is feeling. Feeling is the soul, the secret of everything. There is more music in common people&amp;rsquo;s songs, and they should be collected together. The science of Dhrupad etc., applied to the music of Kirtana will produce the perfect music.</description>

      <title>727 ON MANTRA AND MANTRA-CHAITANYA</title>

      <description>ON MANTRA AND MANTRA-CHAITANYA The Mantra-Shāstris (upholders of the Mantra theory) believe that some words have been handed down through a succession of teachers and disciples, and the mere utterance of them will lead to some form of realisation. There are two different meanings of the word Mantra-chaitanya. According to some, if you practise the repetition of a certain Mantra, you will see the Ishta-Devatā who is the object or deity of that Mantra.</description>

      <title>728 ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD</title>

      <description>ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD Man&amp;rsquo;s inner hankering is to find some one who is free, that is, beyond the laws of nature. The Vedantins believe in such an Eternal Ishvara, while the Buddhists and the Sānkhyas believe only a Janyeshvara (created God), that is, a God who was a man before, but has become God through spiritual practice. The Purānas reconcile these two positions by the doctrine of Incarna tion. That is, they say that the Janyeshvara is nothing but the Nitya (Eternal) Ishvara, taking by Māyā the form of a Janyeshvara.</description>

      <description>ON FOOD You preach to others to be men but cannot give them good food. I have been thinking over this problem for the last four years. I wish to make an experiment whether something of the nature of flattened rice can be made out of wheat. Then we can get a different food every day. About drinking water, I searched for a filter which would suit our country. I found one pan-like porcelain vessel through which water was made to pass, and all the bacilli remained in the porcelain pan.</description>

      <title>730 ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE</title>

      <description>ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE Talking of the respective duties of a monk and a householder, Swamiji said:
A Sannyasin should avoid the food, bedding, etc., which have been touched or used by householders, in order to save himself — not from hatred towards them — so long as he has not risen to the highest grade, that is, become a Paramahamsa. A householder should salute him with &amp;ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&amp;rdquo;, and a Sannyasin should bless the former.</description>

      <title>731 ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY
OF THE GURU</title>

      <description>ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY OF THE GURU In the course of a conversation Swamiji spiritedly remarked, &amp;ldquo;Leave off your commercial calculating ideas. If you can get rid of your attachment to a single thing, you are on the way to liberation. Do not see a public woman, or sinner, or Sādhu. That vile woman also is the Divine Mother. A Sannyāsin says once, twice, that she is Mother; then he gets deluded again and says, &amp;lsquo;Hence, O vile, unchaste woman!</description>

      <title>732 SHRI RAMAKRISHNA
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS
LIFE AND
TEACHINGS</title>

      <description>SHRI RAMAKRISHNA THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS LIFE AND TEACHINGS In a narrow society there is depth and intensity of spirituality. The narrow stream is very rapid. In a catholic society, along with the breadth of vision we find a proportionate loss in depth and intensity. But the life of Sri Ramakrishna upsets all records of history. It is a remarkable phenomenon that in Sri Ramakrishna there has been an assemblage of ideas deeper than the sea and vaster than the skies.</description>

      <description>ON SHRI RAMAKRISHNA AND HIS VIEWS By force, think of one thing at least as Brahman. Of course it is easier to think of Ramakrishna as God, but the danger is that we cannot form Ishvara-buddhi (vision of Divinity) in others. God is eternal, without any form, omnipresent. To think of Him as possessing any form is blasphemy. But the secret of image-worship is that you are trying to develop your vision of Divinity in one thing.</description>

      <title>734 SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION&#39;S IDEAL</title>

      <description>SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION&amp;rsquo;S IDEAL In order that a nation may rise, it must have a high ideal. Now, that ideal is, of course, the abstract Brahman. But as you all cannot be inspired by an abstract ideal, you must have a personal ideal. You have got that, in the person of Shri Ramakrishna. The reason why other personages cannot be our ideal now is, that their days are gone; and in order that Vedanta may come to everyone, there must be a person who is in sympathy with the present generation.</description>

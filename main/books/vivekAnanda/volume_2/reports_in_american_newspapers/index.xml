      <description>DIVINITY OF MAN (Ada Record, February 28, 1894)
The lecture on the Divinity of Man by Swami Vive Kananda, (In the earlier days Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s name was thus mis-spelt by the American Press. — Publisher.) the Hindu monk, drew a packed house at the Opera last Friday evening [February 22].
He stated that the fundamental basis of all religions was belief in the soul which is the real man, and something beyond both mind and matter, and proceeded to demonstrate the proposition.</description>

      <description>SWAMI VIVEKANANDA ON INDIA (Bay City Daily Tribune, March 21, 1894)
Bay City had a distinguished visitor yesterday in the person of Swami Vive Kananda, the much talked of Hindoo monk. He arrived at noon from Detroit where he has been the guest of Senator Palmer and proceeded immediately to the Fraser house. There he was seen by a reporter for The Tribune.
Kananda spoke entertainingly of his country and his impressions of this country.</description>

      <description>RELIGIOUS HARMONY (Saginaw Evening News, March 22, 1894)
Swami Vive Kananda, the much talked of Hindoo monk, spoke to a small but deeply interested audience last evening at the academy of music on &amp;ldquo;The Harmony of Religions&amp;rdquo;. He was dressed in oriental costume and received an extremely cordial reception. Hon. Rowland Connor gracefully introduced the speaker, who devoted the first portion of his lecture to an explanation of the different religions of India and of the theory of transmigration of souls.</description>

      <description>FROM FAR OFF INDIA (Saginaw Courier-Herald, March 22, 1894)
Seated in the lobby of the Hotel Vincent yesterday evening was a strong and regular featured man of fine presence, whose swarthy skin made more pronounced the pearly whiteness of his even teeth. Under a broad and high forehead his eyes betoken intelligence. This gentleman was Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindoo preacher. Mr. Kananda&amp;rsquo;s conversation is in pure and grammatically constructed English sentences, to which his slightly foreign accent lends piquancy.</description>

      <description>AN EVENING WITH OUR HINDU COUSINS (Northampton Daily Herald, April 16, 1894)
For Swami Vive Kananda proved conclusively that all our neighbors across the water, even the remotest, are our close cousins differing only a trifle in color, language, customs and religion, the silver-tongued Hindu monk prefacing his address in city hall Saturday evening [April 14] by an historic sketch of the origin of his own and all other leading nations of the earth which demonstrated the truth that race-kinship is more of a simple fact than many know or always care to admit.</description>

      <description>THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF INDIA (Boston Herald, May 15, 1894)
Association Hall was crowded with ladies yesterday, to hear Swami Vivekananda, the Brahmin (Meaning Hindu. — Publisher.) Monk talk about &amp;ldquo;The Religion of India&amp;rdquo; [actually &amp;ldquo;The Manners and Customs of India&amp;rdquo;], for the benefit of the ward 16 day nursery [actually, Tyler-street Day Nursery]. The Brahmin monk has become a fad in Boston, as he was in Chicago last year, and his earnest, honest, cultured manner has won many friends for him.</description>

      <description>THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA (Boston Herald, May 17, 1894)
The Brahmin monk, Swami Vivekananda, lectured yesterday afternoon in Association Hall on &amp;ldquo;The Religions of India&amp;rdquo;, in aid of the Ward 16 Day Nursery. There was a large attendance.
The speaker first gave an account of the Mahommedans, who formed, he said, one-fifth of the population. They believed in both Old and New Testaments, but Jesus Christ they regarded only as a prophet.</description>

      <description>SECTS AND DOCTRINES IN INDIA (Harvard Crimson, May 17, 1894)
Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, gave an address last evening in Sever Hall under the auspices of the Harvard Religious Union. The address was very interesting, the clear and eloquent voice of the speaker, and his low, earnest delivery making his words singularly impressive.
There are various sects and doctrines in India, said Vivekananda, some of which accept the theory of a personal God, and others which believe that God and the universe are one; but whatever sect the Hindoo belongs to he does not say that his is the only right belief, and that all others must be wrong.</description>

      <description>LESS DOCTRINE AND MORE BREAD (Baltimore American, October 15, 1894)
The Lyceum Theater was crowded last night at the first of a series of meetings by the Vrooman Brothers. The subject discussed was &amp;ldquo;Dynamic Religion&amp;rdquo;.
Swami Vivekananda, the high priest [?] from India, was the last speaker. He spoke briefly, and was listened to with marked attention. His English and his mode of delivery were excellent. There is a foreign accent to his syllables, but not enough to prevent him from being plainly understood.</description>

Fully 3,000 persons were present. Addresses were made by the Rev. Hiram Vrooman, Rev. Walter Vrooman and Rev. Swarri Vivekananda, the Brahmin High Priest now visiting this city.</description>

      <description>ALL RELIGIONS ARE GOOD (Washington Post, October 29, 1894)
Mr. Kananda spoke yesterday at the People&amp;rsquo;s Church on the invitation of Dr. Kent, pastor of the church. His talk in the morning was a regular sermon, dealing entirely with the spiritual side of religion, and presenting the, to orthodox sects, rather original proposition that there is good in the foundation of every religion, that all religions, like languages, are descended from a common stock, and that each is good in its corporal and spiritual aspects so long as it is kept free from dogma and fossilism.</description>

      <description>THE HINDU VIEW OF LIFE (Brooklyn Times, December 31, 1894)
The Brooklyn Ethical Association, at the Pouch Gallery last night, tendered a reception to Swami Vivekananda. . . . Previous to the reception the distinguished visitor delivered a remarkably interesting lecture on &amp;ldquo;The Religions of India&amp;rdquo;. Among other things he said:
&amp;ldquo;The Hindoo&amp;rsquo;s view of life is that we are here to learn; the whole happiness of life is to learn; the human soul is here to love learning and get experience.</description>

      <description>IDEALS OF WOMANHOOD (Brooklyn Standard Union, January 21, 1895)
Swami Vivekananda, after being presented to the audience by Dr. Janes, president of the Ethical Association, said in part:
&amp;ldquo;The product of the slums of any nation cannot be the criterion of our judgment of that nation. One may collect the rotten, worm-eaten apples under every apple tree in the world, and write a book about each of them, and still know nothing of the beauty and possibilities of the apple tree.</description>

      <description>TRUE BUDDHISM (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 4, 1895)
Swami Vivekananda, being presented by Dr. Janes, the president of the Ethical Association, under whose auspices these lectures are given, said in part: &amp;ldquo;The Hindoo occupies a unique position towards Buddhism. Like Christ, who antagonized the Jews, Buddha antagonized the prevailing religion of India; but while Christ was rejected by his countrymen, Buddha was accepted as God Incarnate. He denounced the priestcraft at the very doors of their temples, yet to-day he is worshipped by them.</description>

      <description>INDIA&amp;rsquo;S GIFT TO THE WORLD (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 27, 1895)
Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a fairly large audience at the hall of the Long Island Historical Society, corner Pierrepont and Clinton streets. His subject was &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rsquo;s Gift to the World&amp;rdquo;.
He spoke of the wondrous beauties of his native land, &amp;ldquo;where stood the earliest cradle of ethics, arts, sciences, and literature, and the integrity of whose sons and the virtue of whose daughters have been sung by all travelers.</description>

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, lectured in Historical hall Monday night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical association, on &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rsquo;s Gift to the World&amp;rdquo;. There were about two hundred and fifty people in the hall when the Swami stepped on the platform. Much interest was manifested on account of the denial by Mrs. James McKeen, president of the Brooklyn Ramabai circle, which is interested in Christian work in India, of the statement attributed to the lecture that the child widows of India were not protected [ill-treated].</description>

A special meeting of the Brooklyn Ethical Association with an address by Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk as the main feature, was held at the Pouch Gallery, of Clinton avenue, last night. &amp;ldquo;Some customs of the Hindus what they mean, and how they are misinterpreted,&amp;rdquo; was the subject treated. A large throng of people filled the spacious gallery.
Dressed in his Oriental costume, his eyes bright, and a flush mantling his face, Swami Vivekananda started to tell of his people, of his country, and its customs.</description>

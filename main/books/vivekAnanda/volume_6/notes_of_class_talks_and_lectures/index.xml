      <description>RELIGION AND SCIENCE Experience is the only source of knowledge. In the world, religion is the only science where there is no surety, because it is not taught as a science of experience. This should not be. There is always, however, a small group of men who teach religion from experience. They are called mystics, and these mystics in every religion speak the same tongue and teach the same truth. This is the real science of religion.</description>

      <title>425 RELIGION IS REALISATION</title>

      <description>RELIGION IS REALISATION The greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of realisation; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books and forms and let your soul see its Self. &amp;ldquo;We are deluded and maddened by books&amp;rdquo;, Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The moment you think creed and form and ceremony the &amp;ldquo;be-all&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end-all&amp;rdquo;, then you are in bondage.</description>

      <title>426 RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION</title>

      <description>RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION One cannot divide the rights of the universe. To talk of &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; implies limitation. It is not &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;responsibility&amp;rdquo;. Each is responsible for the evil anywhere in the world. No one can separate himself from his brother. All that unites with the universal is virtue; all that separates is sin. You are a part of the Infinite. This is your nature. Hence you are your brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper.</description>

      <description>UNSELFISH WORK IS TRUE RENUNCIATION This world is not for cowards. Do not try to fly. Look not for success or failure. Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on. Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something behind the work.</description>

      <title>428 FREEDOM OF THE SELF</title>

      <description>FREEDOM OF THE SELF As we cannot know except through effects that we have eyes, so we cannot see the Self except by Its effects. It cannot be brought down to the low plane of sense-perception. It is the condition of everything in the universe, though Itself unconditioned. When we know that we are the Self, then we are free. The Self can never change. It cannot be acted on by a cause, because It is Itself the cause.</description>

      <title>429 NOTES ON VEDANTA</title>

      <description>NOTES ON VEDANTA The cardinal features of the Hindu religion are founded on the meditative and speculative philosophy and on the ethical teachings contained in the various books of the Vedas, which assert that the universe is infinite in space and eternal in duration. It never had a beginning and it never will have an end. Innumerable have been the manifestations of the power of the Spirit in the realm of matter, of the force or the Infinite in the domain of the finite, but the Infinite Itself is self-existent, eternal, and unchangeable.</description>

      <description>HINDU AND GREEK Three mountains stand as typical of progress — the Himalayas of Indo-Aryan, Sinai of Hebrew, and Olympus of Greek civilisation. When the Aryans reached India, they found the climate so hot that they would not work incessantly, so they began to think; thus they became introspective and developed religion. They discovered that there was no limit to the power of mind; they therefore sought to master that; and through it they learnt that there was something infinite coiled up in the frame we call man, which was seeking to become kinetic.</description>

      <title>431 THOUGHTS ON THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_6/notes_of_class_talks_and_lectures/431_thoughts_on_the_vedas_and_upanishads/</link>

      <description>THOUGHTS ON THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS The Vedic sacrificial altar was the origin of Geometry.
The invocation of the Devas, or bright ones, was the basis of worship. The idea is that one invoked is helped and helps.
Hymns are not only words of praise but words of power, being pronounced with the right attitude of mind.
Heavens are only other states of existence with added senses and heightened powers.</description>

      <title>432 ON RAJA-YOGA</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_6/notes_of_class_talks_and_lectures/432_on_raja-yoga/</link>

      <guid>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_6/notes_of_class_talks_and_lectures/432_on_raja-yoga/</guid>
      <description>ON RAJA-YOGA The first stage of Yoga is Yama.
To master Yama five things are necessary:
(1) Non-injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.
(2) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed
(3) Non-covetousness in thought, word, and deed.
(4) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.
(5) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.
Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it.
Then come Âsana, or posture, of a devotee.</description>

      <description>ON BHAKTI-YOGA Bhakti-Yoga is the path of systematised devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute. It is the easiest and surest path to religion or realisation.
Love to God is the one essential to be perfect in this path.
There are five stages of love.
First, man wants help and has a little fear.
Second, when God is seen as Father.
Third, when God is seen as Mother. Then all women are looked upon as reflections of the Mother-God.</description>

      <title>434 ON JNANA-YOGA</title>

      <description>ON JNANA-YOGA First, meditation should be of a negative nature. Think away everything. Analyse everything that comes in the mind by the sheer action of the will.
Next, assert what we really are — existence, knowledge and bliss — being, knowing, and loving.
Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object. Meditate:
Above, it is full of me; below, it is full of me; in the middle, it is full of me.</description>

      <title>435 THE REALITY AND SHADOW</title>

      <description>THE REALITY AND SHADOW That which differentiates one thing from another is time, space, and causation.
The differentiation is in the form, not in the substance.
You may destroy the form and it disappears for ever; but the substance remains the same. You can never destroy the substance.
Evolution is in nature, not in the soul — evolution of nature, manifestation of the soul.
Maya is not illusion as it is popularly interpreted.</description>

      <title>436 HOW TO BECOME FREE</title>

      <description>HOW TO BECOME FREE All things in nature work according to law. Nothing is excepted. The mind as well as everything in external nature is governed and controlled by law.
Internal and external nature, mind and matter, are in time and space, and are bound by the law of causation.
The freedom of the mind is a delusion. How can the mind be free when it is controlled and bound by law?</description>

      <description>SOUL AND GOD Anything that is in space has form. Space itself has form. Either you are in space, or space is in you. The soul is beyond all space. Space is in the soul, not the soul in space.
Form is confined to time and space and is bound by the law of causation. All time is in us, we are not in time. As the soul is not in time and space, all time and space are within the soul.</description>

      <description>THE GOAL Dualism recognises God and nature to be eternally separate: the universe and nature eternally dependent upon God.
The extreme monists make no such distinction. In the last analysis, they claim, all is God: the universe becomes lost in God; God is the eternal life of the universe.
With them infinite and finite are mere terms. The universe, nature, etc. exist by virtue of differentiation. Nature is itself differentiation.</description>

      <description>ON PROOF OF RELIGION The great question about religion is: What makes it so unscientific? If religion is a science, why is it not as certain as other sciences? All beliefs in God, heaven, etc., are mere conjectures, mere beliefs. There seems to be nothing certain about it. Our ideas concerning religion are changing all the time. The mind is in a constant state of flux.
Is man a soul, an unchanging substance, or is he a constantly changing quantity?</description>

      <title>440 THE DESIGN THEORY</title>

      <description>THE DESIGN THEORY The idea that nature in all her orderly arrangements shows design on the part of the Creator of the universe is good as a kindergarten teaching to show the beauty, power, and glory of God, in order to lead children in religion up to a philosophical conception of God; but apart from that, it is not good, and perfectly illogical. As a philosophical idea, it is entirely without foundation, if God is taken to be omnipotent.</description>

      <description>SPIRIT AND NATURE Religion is the realisation of Spirit as Spirit; not Spirit as matter.
Religion is a growth. Each one must experience it himself. The Christians believe that Jesus Christ died to save man. With you it is belief in a doctrine, and this belief constitutes your salvation. With us doctrine has nothing whatever to do with salvation. Each one may believe in whatever doctrine he likes; or in no doctrine.</description>

      <description>THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION (At Alameda, Calif., March 18, 1900)
We read many books, but that does not bring us knowledge. We may read all the Bibles in the world, but that will not give us religion. Theoretical religion is easy enough to get, any one may get that. What we want is practical religion.
The Christian idea of a practical religion is in doing good works — worldly utility.</description>

      <description>NOTES TAKEN DOWN IN MADRAS, 1892-93 The three essentials of Hinduism are belief in God, in the Vedas as revelation, in the doctrine of Karma and transmigration.
If one studies the Vedas between the lines, one sees a religion of harmony.
One point of difference between Hinduism and other religions is that in Hinduism we pass from truth to truth — from a lower truth to a higher truth — and never from error to truth.</description>

      <description>CONCENTRATION Concentration is the essence of all knowledge, nothing can be done without it. Ninety per cent of thought force is wasted by the ordinary human being, and therefore he is constantly committing blunders; the trained man or mind never makes a mistake. When the mind is concentrated and turned backward on itself, all within us will be our servants, not our masters. The Greeks applied their concentration to the external world, and the result was perfection in art, literature, etc.</description>

      <description>THE POWER OF THE MIND The cause becomes the effect. The cause is not one thing and the effect something else that exists as a result. The effect is always the cause worked out. Always, the cause becomes the effect. The popular idea is that the effect is the result of the operation of a cause which is something independent and aloof from the effect. al his is not so. The effect is always the cause worked out into another condition.</description>

PRANA
The theory of creation is that matter is subject to five conditions: ether, luminous ether, gaseous, liquid, and solid. They are all evoked out of one primal element, which is very finest ether.
The name of the energy in the universe is Prāna, which is the force residing in these elements.</description>

      <description>LESSONS ON BHAKTI-YOGA THE YOGA THROUGH DEVOTION
We have been considering Raja-Yoga and the physical exercises. Now we shall consider Yoga through devotion. But you must remember that no one system is necessary (for all). I want to set before you many systems, many ideals, in order that you may find one that will suit you; if one does not, perhaps another may.
We want to become harmonious beings, with the psychical, spiritual, intellectual, and working (active) sides of our nature equally developed.</description>

      <description>MOTHER-WORSHIP (Based on fragmentary notes of a class talk by Swami Vivekananda in New York.)
The two conjoint facts of perception we can never get rid of are happiness and unhappiness — things which bring us pain also bring pleasure. Our world is made up of these two. We cannot get rid of them; with every pulsation of life they are present. The world is busy trying to reconcile these opposites, sages trying to find solution of this commingling of the opposites.</description>

      <description>NARADA-BHAKTI-SUTRAS (A free translation dictated by Swamiji in America)
CHAPTER I
1. Bhakti is intense love for God.
2. It is the nectar of love;
3. Getting which man becomes perfect, immortal, and satisfied for ever;
4. Getting which man desires no more, does not become jealous of anything, does not take pleasure in vanities:
5. Knowing which man becomes filled with spirituality, becomes calm, and finds pleasure only in God.</description>

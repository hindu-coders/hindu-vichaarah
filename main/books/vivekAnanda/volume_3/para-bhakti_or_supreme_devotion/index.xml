      <description>CHAPTER I
THE PREPARATORY RENUNCIATION We have now finished the consideration of what may be called the preparatory Bhakti, and are entering on the study of the Parā-Bhakti or supreme devotion. We have to speak of a preparation to the practice of this Para-Bhakti. All such preparations are intended only for the purification of the soul. The repetition of names, the rituals, the forms, and the symbols, all these various things are for the purification of the soul.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE BHAKTA&amp;rsquo;S RENUNCIATION RESULTS FROM LOVE We see love everywhere in nature. Whatever in society is good and great and sublime is the working out of that love; whatever in society is very bad, nay diabolical, is also the ill-directed working out of the same emotion of love. It is this same emotion that gives us the pure and holy conjugal love between husband and wife as well as the sort of love which goes to satisfy the lowest forms of animal passion.</description>

      <title>118 THE FORMS OF LOVE — MANIFESTATION</title>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE FORMS OF LOVE — MANIFESTATION Here are some of the forms in which love manifests itself. First there is reverence. Why do people show reverence to temples and holy places? Because He is worshipped there, and His presence is associated with all such places. Why do people in every country pay reverence to teachers of religion? It is natural for the human heart to do so, because all such teachers preach the Lord.</description>

      <title>119 UNIVERSAL LOVE AND HOW IT LEADS TO SELF-SURRENDER</title>

      <description>CHAPTER V
UNIVERSAL LOVE AND HOW IT LEADS TO SELF-SURRENDER How can we love the Vyashti, the particular, without first loving the Samashti, the universal? God is the Samashti, the generalised and the abstract universal whole; and the universe that we see is the Vyashti, the particularised thing. To love the whole universe is possible only by way of loving the Samashti — the universal — which is, as it were, the one unity in which are to be found millions and millions of smaller unities.</description>

      <title>120 THE HIGHER KNOWLEDGE AND THE HIGHER LOVE ARE ONE TO THE TRUE
LOVER</title>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
THE HIGHER KNOWLEDGE AND THE HIGHER LOVE ARE ONE TO THE TRUE LOVER The Upanishads distinguish between a higher knowledge and a lower knowledge; and to the Bhakta there is really no difference between this higher knowledge and his higher love (Parā-Bhakti). The Mundaka Upanishad says:
द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये इति ह स्म यद्ब्रह्मविदो वदन्ति। परा चैवापरा च॥ तत्रापरा ॠग्वेदो यजुर्वदः सामवेदोऽथर्ववेदः शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दो ज्योतिषमिति। अथ परा यया तदक्षरमधिगम्यते॥</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
THE TRIANGLE OF LOVE We may represent love as a triangle, each of the angles of which corresponds to one of its inseparable characteristics. There can be no triangle without all its three angles; and there can be no true love without its three following characteristics. The first angle of our triangle of love is that love knows no bargaining. Wherever there is any seeking for something in return, there can, be no real love; it becomes a mere matter of shop-keeping.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
THE GOD OF LOVE IS HIS OWN PROOF What is the ideal of the lover who has quite passed beyond the idea of selfishness, of bartering and bargaining, and who knows no fear? Even to the great God such a man will say, &amp;ldquo;I will give You my all, and I do not want anything from You; indeed there is nothing that I can call my own.&amp;rdquo; When a man has acquired this conviction, his ideal becomes one of perfect love, one of perfect fearlessness of love.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
HUMAN REPRESENTATIONS OF THE DIVINE IDEAL OF LOVE It is impossible to express the nature of this supreme and absolute ideal of love in human language. Even the highest flight of human imagination is incapable of comprehending it in all its infinite perfection and beauty. Nevertheless, the followers of the religion of love, in its higher as well as its lower forms, in all countries, have all along had to use the inadequate human language to comprehend and to define their own ideal of love.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
CONCLUSION When this highest ideal of love is reached, philosophy is thrown away; who will then care for it? Freedom, Salvation, Nirvāna — all are thrown away; who cares to become free while in the enjoyment of divine love? &amp;ldquo;Lord, I do not want wealth, nor friends, nor beauty, nor learning, nor even freedom; let me be born again and again, and be Thou ever my Love. Be Thou ever and ever my Love.</description>

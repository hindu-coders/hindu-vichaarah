      <description>CHAPTER I
PRAYER स तन्मयो ह्यमृत ईशसंस्थो ज्ञः सर्वगो भुवनस्यास्य गोप्ता।
य ईशेऽस्य जगतो नित्यमेव नान्यो हेतुर्विद्यत ईशनाय॥
यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्व यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै।
तं ह देवं आत्मबुध्दिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये॥
&amp;ldquo;He is the Soul of the Universe; He is Immortal; His is the Rulership; He is the All-knowing, the All-pervading, the Protector of the Universe, the Eternal Ruler. None else is there efficient to govern the world eternally.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE PHILOSOPHY OF ISHVARA Who is Ishvara? Janmādyasya yatah — &amp;ldquo;From whom is the birth, continuation, and dissolution of the universe,&amp;rdquo; — He is Ishvara — &amp;ldquo;the Eternal, the Pure, the Ever-Free, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Merciful, the Teacher of all teachers&amp;rdquo;; and above all, Sa Ishvarah anirvachaniya-premasvarupah — &amp;ldquo;He the Lord is, of His own nature, inexpressible Love.&amp;rdquo; These certainly are the definitions of a Personal God.</description>

      <title>108 SPIRITUAL REALISATION, THE AIM OF BHAKTI-YOGA</title>

      <description>CHAPTER III
SPIRITUAL REALISATION, THE AIM OF BHAKTI-YOGA To the Bhakta these dry details are necessary only to strengthen his will; beyond that they are of no use to him. For he is treading on a path which is fitted very soon to lead him beyond the hazy and turbulent regions of reason, to lead him to the realm of realisation. He, soon, through the mercy of the Lord, reaches a plane where pedantic and powerless reason is left far behind, and the mere intellectual groping through the dark gives place to the daylight of direct perception.</description>

      <title>109 THE NEED OF GURU</title>
      <link>https://hindutva.github.io/main/books/vivekAnanda/volume_3/bhakti-yoga/109_the_need_of_guru/</link>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE NEED OF GURU Every soul is destined to be perfect, and every being, in the end, will attain the state of perfection. Whatever we are now is the result of our acts and thoughts in the past; and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we think end do now. But this, the shaping of our own destinies, does not preclude our receiving help from outside; nay, in the vast majority of cases such help is absolutely necessary.</description>

      <title>110 QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ASPIRANT AND THE TEACHER</title>

      <description>CHAPTER V
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ASPIRANT AND THE TEACHER How are we to know a teacher, then? The sun requires no torch to make him visible, we need not light a candle in order to see him. When the sun rises, we instinctively become aware of the fact, and when a teacher of men comes to help us, the soul will instinctively know that truth has already begun to shine upon it.</description>

      <title>111 INCARNATE TEACHERS AND INCARNATION</title>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
INCARNATE TEACHERS AND INCARNATION Wherever His name is spoken, that very place is holy. How much more so is the man who speaks His name, and with what veneration ought we to approach that man out of whom comes to us spiritual truth! Such great teachers of spiritual truth are indeed very few in number in this world, but the world is never altogether without them. They are always the fairest flowers of human life — अहेतुकदयासिन्धुः — &amp;ldquo;the ocean of mercy without any motive&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>112 THE MANTRA: OM: WORD AND WISDOM</title>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
THE MANTRA: OM: WORD AND WISDOM But we are now considering not these Mahā-purushas, the great Incarnations, but only the Siddha-Gurus (teachers who have attained the goal); they, as a rule, have to convey the germs of spiritual wisdom to the disciple by means of words (Mantras) to be meditated upon. What are these Mantras? The whole of this universe has, according to Indian philosophy, both name and form (Nāma-Rupa) as its conditions of manifestation.</description>

      <title>113 WORSHIP OF SUBSTITUTES AND IMAGES</title>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
WORSHIP OF SUBSTITUTES AND IMAGES The next points to be considered are the worship of Pratikas or of things more or less satisfactory as substitutes for God, and the worship of Pratimās or images. What is the worship of God through a Pratika? It is अब्रह्मणि ब्रह्मदृष्ट्याऽनुसन्धानम् — Joining the mind with devotion to that which is not Brahman, taking it to be Brahman&amp;rdquo; — says Bhagavān Rāmānuja. &amp;ldquo;Worship the mind as Brahman this is internal; and the Âkāsha as Brahman, this is with regard to the Devas&amp;rdquo;, says Shankara.</description>

      <title>114 THE CHOSEN IDEAL</title>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
THE CHOSEN IDEAL The next thing to be considered is what we know as Ishta-Nishthā. One who aspires to be a Bhakta must know that &amp;ldquo;so many opinions are so many ways&amp;rdquo;. He must know that all the various sects of the various religions are the various manifestations of the glory of the same Lord. &amp;ldquo;They call You by so many names; they divide You, as it were, by different names, yet in each one of these is to be found Your omnipotence&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
THE METHOD AND THE MEANS In regard to the method and the means of Bhakti-Yoga we read in the commentary of Bhagavan Ramanuja on the Vedanta-Sutras: &amp;ldquo;The attaining of That comes through discrimination, controlling the passions, practice, sacrificial work, purity, strength, and suppression of excessive joy.&amp;rdquo; Viveka or discrimination is, according to Ramanuja, discriminating, among other things, the pure food from the impure. According to him, food becomes impure from three causes: (1) by the nature of the food itself, as in the case of garlic etc.</description>

      <description>FIRST PUBLIC LECTURE IN THE EAST (Delivered in Colombo)
After his memorable work in the West, Swami Vivekananda landed at Colombo on the afternoon of January 15, 1897, and was given a right royal reception by the Hindu community there. The following address of welcome was then presented to him:
SRIMAT VIVEKANANDA SWAMI
REVERED SIR,
In pursuance of a resolution passed at a public meeting of the Hindus of the city of Colombo, we beg to offer you a hearty welcome to this Island.</description>

      <description>VEDANTISM The following address of welcome from the Hindus of Jaffna was presented to Swami Vivekananda:
SRIMAT VIVEKANANDA SWAMI
REVERED SIR,
We, the inhabitants of Jaffna professing the Hindu religion, desire to offer you a most hearty welcome to our land, the chief centre of Hinduism in Ceylon, and to express our thankfulness for your kind acceptance of our invitation to visit this part of Lanka.
Our ancestors settled here from Southern India, more than two thousand years ago, and brought with them their religion, which was patronised by the Tamil kings of Jaffna; but when their government was displaced by that of the Portuguese and the Dutch, the observance of religious rites was interfered with, public religious worship was prohibited, and the Sacred Temples, including two of the most far-famed Shrines, were razed to the ground by the cruel hand of persecution.</description>

      <description>ADDRESS AT THE RAMESWARAM TEMPLE ON REAL WORSHIP A visit was subsequently paid to the Rameswaram Temple, where the Swami was asked to address a few words to the people who had assembled there. This he did in the following terms:
It is in love that religion exists and not in ceremony, in the pure and sincere love in the heart. Unless a man is pure in body and mind, his coming into a temple and worshipping Shiva is useless.</description>

We, the inhabitants of this ancient and historic Samsthānam of Sethu Bandha Rameswaram, otherwise known as Rāmanāthapuram or Ramnad, beg, most cordially, to welcome you to this, our motherland.</description>

SREEMAT VIVEKANANDA SWAMI
We, the citizens of Paramakudi, respectfully beg to accord your Holiness a most hearty welcome to this place after your successful spiritual campaign of nearly four years in the Western world.
We share with our countrymen the feelings of joy and pride at the philanthropy which prompted you to attend the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago, and lay before the representatives of the religious world the sacred but hidden treasures of our ancient land.</description>

      <description>REPLY TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME AT MADURA (Spelt now as Madurai)
The Swami was presented with an address of welcome by the Hindus of Madura, which read as follows:
MOST REVERED SWAMI,
We, the Hindu Public of Madura, beg to offer you our most heartfelt and respectful welcome to our ancient and holy city. We realise in you a living example of the Hindu Sannyasin, who, renouncing all worldly ties and attachments calculated to lead to the gratification of the self, is worthily engaged in the noble duty of living for others and endeavouring to raise the spiritual condition of mankind.</description>

      <description>REPLY TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME AT MADRAS When the Swami Vivekananda arrived at Madras an address of welcome was presented to him by the Madras Reception Committee. It read as follows:
REVERED SWAMIN,
On behalf of your Hindu co-religionists in Madras, we offer you a most hearty welcome on the occasion of your return from your Religious Mission in the West. Our object in approaching you with this address is not the performance of any merely formal or ceremonial function; we come to offer you the love of our hearts and to give expression to our feeling of thankfulness for the services which you, by the grace of God, have been able to render to the great cause of Truth by proclaiming India&amp;rsquo;s lofty religious ideals.</description>

      <description>MY PLAN OF CAMPAIGN (Delivered at the Victoria Hall, Madras)
As the other day we could not proceed, owing to the crowd, I shall take this opportunity of thanking the people of Madras for the uniform kindness that I have received at their hands. I do not know how better to express my gratitude for the beautiful words that have been expressed in the addresses than by praying to the Lord to make me worthy of the kind and generous expressions and by working all my life for the cause of our religion and to serve our motherland; and may the Lord make me worthy of them.</description>

      <description>VEDANTA IN ITS APPLICATION TO INDIAN LIFE There is a word which has become very common as an appellation of our race and our religion. The word &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; requires a little explanation in connection with what I mean by Vedantism. This word &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; was the name that the ancient Persians used to apply to the river Sindhu. Whenever in Sanskrit there is an &amp;ldquo;s&amp;rdquo;, in ancient Persian it changes into &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo;, so that &amp;ldquo;Sindhu&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;; and you are all aware how the Greeks found it hard to pronounce &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo; and dropped it altogether, so that we became known as Indians.</description>

      <description>THE SAGES OF INDIA In speaking of the sages of India, my mind goes back to those periods of which history has no record, and tradition tries in vain to bring the secrets out of the gloom of the past. The sages of India have been almost innumerable, for what has the Hindu nation been doing for thousands of years except producing sages? I will take, therefore, the lives of a few of the most brilliant ones, the epoch-makers, and present them before you, that is to say, my study of them.</description>

      <description>THE WORK BEFORE US (Delivered at the Triplicane Literary Society, Madras)
The problem of life is becoming deeper and broader every day as the world moves on. The watchword and the essence have been preached in the days of yore when the Vedantic truth was first discovered, the solidarity of all life. One atom in this universe cannot move without dragging the whole world along with it. There cannot be any progress without the whole world following in the wake, and it is becoming every day dearer that the solution of any problem can never be attained on racial, or national, or narrow grounds.</description>

      <description>THE FUTURE OF INDIA This is the ancient land where wisdom made its home before it went into any other country, the same India whose influx of spirituality is represented, as it were, on the material plane, by rolling rivers like oceans, where the eternal Himalayas, rising tier above tier with their snowcaps, look as it were into the very mysteries of heaven. Here is the same India whose soil has been trodden by the feet of the greatest sages that ever lived.</description>

      <description>ON CHARITY During his stay in Madras the Swami presided at the annual meeting of the Chennapuri Annadāna Samājam, an institution of a charitable nature, and in the course of a brief address referred to a remark by a previous speaker deprecating special alms-giving to the Brahmin over and above the other castes. Swamiji pointed out that this had its good as well as its bad side. All the culture, practically which the nation possessed, was among the Brahmins, and they also had been the thinkers of the nation.</description>

      <description>ADDRESS OF WELCOME PRESENTED AT CALCUTTA AND REPLY On his arrival in Calcutta, the Swami Vivekananda was greeted with intense enthusiasm, and the whole of his progress through the decorated streets of the city was thronged with an immense crowd waiting to have a sight of him. The official reception was held a week later, at the residence of the late Raja Radha Kanta Deb Bahadur at Sobha Bazar, when Raja Benoy Krishna Deb Bahadur took the chair.</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASES (Delivered in Calcutta)
Away back, where no recorded history, nay, not even the dim light of tradition, can penetrate, has been steadily shining the light, sometimes dimmed by external circumstances, at others effulgent, but undying and steady, shedding its lustre not only over India, but permeating the whole thought-world with its power, silent, unperceived, gentle, yet omnipotent, like the dew that falls in the morning, unseen and unnoticed, yet bringing into bloom the fairest of roses: this has been the thought of the Upanishads, the philosophy of the Vedanta.</description>

      <description>ADDRESS OF WELCOME AT ALMORA AND REPLY On his arrival at Almora, Swamiji received an Address of Welcome in Hindi from the citizens of Almora, of which the following is a translation:
GREAT-SOULED ONE,
Since the time we heard that, after gaining spiritual conquest in the West, you had started from England for your motherland, India, we were naturally desirous of having the pleasure of seeing you. By the grace of the Almighty, that auspicious moment has at last come.</description>

      <description>VEDIC TEACHING IN THEORY AND PRACTICE When the Swami&amp;rsquo;s visit was drawing to a close, his friends in Almora invited him to give a lecture in Hindi. He consented to make the attempt for the first time. He began slowly, and soon warmed to his theme, and found himself building his phrases and almost his words as he went along. Those best acquainted with the difficulties and limitations of the Hindi language, still undeveloped as a medium for oratory, expressed their opinion that a personal triumph had been achieved by Swamiji and that he had proved by his masterly use of Hindi that the language had in it undreamt-of possibilities of development in the direction of oratory.</description>

In response to invitations from the Punjab and Kashmir, the Swami Vivekananda travelled through those parts. He stayed in Kashmir for over a month and his work there was very much appreciated by the Maharaja and his brothers. He then spent a few days in visiting Murree, Rawalpindi, and Jammu, and at each of these places he delivered lectures. Subsequently he visited Sialkote and lectured twice, once in English and once in Hindi.</description>

      <description>BHAKTI (Delivered at Lahore on the 9th November, 1897)
There is a sound which comes to us like a distant echo in the midst of the roaring torrents of the Upanishads, at times rising in proportion and volume, and yet, throughout the literature of the Vedanta, its voice, though clear, is not very strong. The main duty of the Upanishads seems to be to present before us the spirit and the aspect of the sublime, and yet behind this wonderful sublimity there come to us here and there glimpses of poetry as we read; न तत्र सुर्यो भाति न चंन्द्रतारकं नेमा विद्युतो भान्ति कुतोऽयमग्निः — &amp;ldquo;There the sun shines not, nor the moon, nor the stars, what to speak of this fire?</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA (Delivered at Lahore on 12th November, 1897)
Two worlds there are in which we live, one the external, the other internal. Human progress has been made, from days of yore, almost in parallel lines along both these worlds. The search began in the external, and man at first wanted to get answers for all the deep problems from outside nature. Man wanted to satisfy his thirst for the beautiful and the sublime from all that surrounded him; he wanted to express himself and all that was within him in the language of the concrete; and grand indeed were the answers he got, most marvellous ideas of God and worship, and most rapturous expressions of the beautiful.</description>

      <description>VEDANTISM At Khetri on 20th December 1897, Swami Vivekananda delivered a lecture on Vedantism in the hall of the Maharaja&amp;rsquo;s bungalow in which he lodged with his disciples. The Swami was introduced by the Raja, who was the president of the meeting; and he spoke for more than an hour and a half. The Swami was at his best, and it was a matter of regret that no shorthand writer was present to report this interesting lecture at length.</description>

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
When I was travelling through the Eastern parts of Asia, one thing especially struck me — that is the prevalence of Indian spiritual thought in Eastern Asiatic countries.</description>

      <description>SANNYASA: ITS IDEAL AND PRACTICE A parting Address was given to Swamiji by the junior Sannyāsins of the Math (Belur), on the eve of his leaving for the West for the second time. The following is the substance of Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s reply as entered in the Math Diary on 19th June 1899:
This is not the time for a long lecture. But I shall speak to you in brief about a few things which I should like you to carry into practice.</description>

      <description>WHAT HAVE I LEARNT? (Delivered at Dacca, 30th March, 1901)
At Dacca Swamiji delivered two lectures in English. The first was on &amp;ldquo;What have I learnt?&amp;rdquo; and the second one was &amp;ldquo;The Religion we are born in &amp;ldquo;. The following is translated from a report in Bengali by a disciple, and it contains the substance of the first lecture:
First of all, I must express my pleasure at the opportunity afforded me of coming to Eastern Bengal to acquire an intimate knowledge of this part of the country, which I hitherto lacked in spite of my wanderings through many civilised countries of the West, as well as my gratification at the sight of majestic rivers, wide fertile plains, and picturesque villages in this, my own country of Bengal, which I had not the good fortune of seeing for myself before.</description>

In the remote past, our country made gigantic advances in spiritual ideas. Let us, today, bring before our mind&amp;rsquo;s eye that ancient history.</description>

      <description>INDIA: HER RELIGION AND CUSTOMS (Salem Evening News, August 29, 1893)
In spite of the warm weather of yesterday afternoon, a goodly number of members of the Thought and Work club, with guests, gathered in Wesley chapel to meet Swami Vive Kanonda,1 a Hindoo monk, now travelling in this country, and to listen to an informal address from that gentleman, principally upon the religion of the Hindoos as taught by their Vedar (Vedas.</description>

      <description>HINDUS AT THE FAIR (Boston Evening Transcript, September 30, 1893)
Chicago, Sept. 23:
There is a room at the left of the entrance to the Art Palace marked &amp;ldquo;No. 1 — keep out.&amp;rdquo; To this the speakers at the Congress of Religions all repair sooner or later, either to talk with one another or with President Bonney, whose private office is in one corner of the apartment. The folding doors are jealously guarded from the general public, usually standing far enough apart to allow peeping in.</description>

      <description>AT THE PARLIAMENT OF RELIGIONS (The Dubuque, Iowa, Times, September 29, 1893)
WORLD&amp;rsquo;S FAIR, Sept. 28. — (Special.) — The Parliament of religions reached a point where sharp acerbities develop. The thin veil of courtesy was maintained, of course, but behind it was ill feeling. Rev. Joseph Cook criticised the Hindoos sharply and was more sharply criticised in turn. He said that to speak of a universe that was not created is almost unpardonable nonsense, and the Asiatics retorted that a universe which had a beginning is a self-evident absurdity.</description>

      <description>PERSONAL TRAITS (Critic, October 7, 1893)
. . . It was an outgrowth of the Parliament of Religions, which opened our eyes to the fact that the philosophy of the ancient creeds contains much beauty for the moderns. When we had once clearly perceived this, our interest in their exponents quickened, and with characteristic eagerness we set out in pursuit of knowledge. The most available means of obtaining it, after the close of the Parliament, was through the addresses and lectures of Swami Vivekananda, who is still in this city [Chicago].</description>

      <description>REINCARNATION (Evanston Index, October 7, 1893)
At the Congregational Church, during the past week, there have been given a course of lectures which in nature much resembled the Religious Parliament which has just been completed. The lecturers were Dr. Carl van Bergen of Sweden, and Suami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk. &amp;hellip; Suami Vivekananda is a representative from India to the Parliament of Religions. He has attracted a great deal of attention on account of his unique attire in Mandarin colors, by his magnetic presence and by his brilliant oratory and wonderful exposition of Hindu philosophy.</description>

      <description>HINDU CIVILISATION [Although the lecture at Streator on October 9 was well attended, the Streator Daily Free Press of October 9 ran the following somewhat dreary review:]
The lecture of this celebrated Hindoo at the Opera House, Saturday night, was very interesting. By comparative philology, he sought to establish the long admitted relationship between the Aryan races and their descendants in the new world. He mildly defended the caste system of India which keeps three-fourths of the people in utter and humiliating subjection, and boasted that the India of today was the same India that had watched for centuries the meteoric nations of the world flash across the horizon and sink into oblivion.</description>

      <description>AN INTERESTING LECTURE (Wisconsin State Journal, November 21, 1893)
The lecture at the Congregational Church [Madison] last night by the celebrated Hindoo monk, Vivekananda, was an extremely interesting one, and contained much of sound philosophy and good religion. Pagan though he be, Christianity may well follow many of his teachings. His creed is as wide as the universe, taking in all religions, and accepting truth wherever it may be found. Bigotry and superstition and idle ceremony, he declared, have no place in &amp;ldquo;the religions of India&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>THE HINDOO RELIGION (Minneapolis Star, November 25, 1893)
&amp;ldquo;Brahminism&amp;rdquo; in all its subtle attraction, because of its embodiment of ancient and truthful principles, was the subject which held an audience in closest attention last evening at the First Unitarian Church [Minneapolis], while Swami Vive Kananda expounded the Hindoo faith. It was an audience which included thoughtful women and men, for the lecturer had been invited by the &amp;ldquo;Peripatetics,&amp;rdquo; and among the friends who shared the privilege with them were ministers of varied denominations, as well as students and scholars.</description>

      <description>THE HINDOO MONK (Appeal-Avalanche, January 16, 1894)
Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindoo monk, who is to lecture at the Auditorium [Memphis] tonight, is one of the most eloquent men who has ever appeared on the religious or lecture platform in this country. His matchless oratory, deep penetration into things occult, his cleverness in debate, and great earnestness captured the closest attention of the world&amp;rsquo;s thinking men at the World&amp;rsquo;s Fair Parliament of Religion, and the admiration of thousands of people who have since heard him during his lecture tour through many of the states of the Union.</description>

      <description>PLEA FOR TOLERANCE (Memphis Commercial, January 17, 1894)
An audience of fair proportions gathered last night at the Auditorium to greet the celebrated Hindu monk. Swami Vive Kananda, in his lecture on Hinduism.
He was introduced in a brief but informing address by Judge R. J. Morgan, who gave a sketch of the development of the great Aryan race, from which development have come the Europeans and the Hindus alike, so tracing a racial kinship between the people of America and the speaker who was to address them.</description>

      <description>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS IN INDIA (Appeal-Avalanche, January 21, 1894)
Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture at La Salette Academy [Memphis] yesterday afternoon. Owing to the pouring rain, a very small audience was present.
The subject discussed was &amp;ldquo;Manners and Customs in India.&amp;rdquo; Vive Kananda is advancing theories of religious thought which find ready lodgment in the minds of some of the most advanced thinkers of this as well as other cities of America.</description>

      <description>HINDOO PHILOSOPHY (Detroit Free Press, February 16, 1894)
The second lecture of the Hindoo monk, Swami Vive Kananda, was given last evening at the Unitarian church to a large and very appreciative audience. The expectation of the audience that the speaker would enlighten them regarding &amp;ldquo;Hindoo Philosophy,&amp;rdquo; as the lecture was entitled, was gratified to only a limited extent. Allusions were made to the philosophy of Buddha, and the speaker was applauded when he said that Buddhism was the first missionary religion of the world, and that it had secured the largest number of converts without the shedding of a drop of blood; but he did not tell his audience anything about the religion or philosophy of Buddha.</description>

      <description>MIRACLES (Evening News, February 17, 1894)
I cannot comply with the request of The News to work a miracle in proof of my religion,&amp;rdquo; said Vive Kananda to a representative of this paper, after being shown The News editorial on the subject. &amp;ldquo;In the first place, I am no miracle worker, and in the second place the pure Hindoo religion I profess is not based on miracles. We do not recognize such a thing as miracles.</description>

      <description>THE DIVINITY OF MAN (Detroit Free Press, February 18, 1894)
Swami Vive Kananda, Hindoo philosopher and priest, concluded his series of lectures, or rather, sermons, at the Unitarian church last night, speaking on &amp;ldquo;The Divinity of God&amp;rdquo; [sic]. (Actually the subject was &amp;ldquo;The Divinity of Man&amp;rdquo;.) In spite of the bad weather, the church was crowded almost to the doors half an hour before the eastern brother — as he likes to be called — appeared.</description>

      <description>THE LOVE OF GOD (The Detroit Free Press report of this lecture is printed in Vol. VIII of the Complete Works.)
(Detroit Tribune, February 21, 1894)
The First Unitarian Church was crowded last night to hear Vive Kananda. The audience was composed of people who came from Jefferson Avenue and the upper part of Woodward Avenue. Most of it was ladies who seemed deeply interested in the address and applauded several remarks of the Brahman with much enthusiasm.</description>

      <description>THE WOMEN OF INDIA (Detroit Free Press, March 25, 1894)
Kananda lectured last night at the Unitarian church on &amp;ldquo;The Women of India.&amp;rdquo; The speaker reverted to the women of ancient India, showing in what high regard they are held in the holy books, where women were prophetesses. Their spirituality then was admirable. It is unfair to judge women in the east by the western standard. In the west woman is the wife; in the east she is the mother.</description>

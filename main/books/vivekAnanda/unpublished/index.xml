I MADRAS
the 15th February [1893]
YOUR HIGHNESS,
Two things I am telling your Highness. One — a very wonderful phenomenon I have seen in a village called Kumbakonam, and another about myself.
In the said village lives a man of the Chetty caste, generally passing for an astrologer. I, with two other young men, went to see him. He was said to tell about anything a man thinks of.</description>

Leaving Khetri there happened nothing particular to relate except that I had every comfort on the way, broke journey at Kharari and then [went] to Nariad [Nadiad]. Haridas Bhai was as usual very kind to me and we had many and many a talk about your Highness, so much so that he was really very anxious to see you and intends paying his respects to your Highness in his coming winter tour to the north.</description>

      <description>(New York Times September 10, 1893) The meetings of the Social Science Association have been a considerable factor in the week’s excitement, attracting a large and representative gathering of persons at every session. A most picturesque figure at these meetings has been the Hindu priest, (Swami Vive Kananda,) who has spoken at several of them upon the deplorable condition of the poor of India and some of the causes which bring it about.</description>

      <description>(Iowa State Register December 3, 1893) Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, spoke three times in Des Moines. During his stay in the city, which was happily prolonged by the cancellation of engagements farther west, Vivekananda met many of the best people in the city, who found their time well spent discussing religious and metaphysical questions with him. But it was woe to the man who undertook to combat the monk on his own ground, and that was where they all tried it who tried it at all.</description>

      <description>(Indian Nation April 9, 1894) He (the Swami) is beating his head against the rocks when he tries to prove that a religion which lays claim to organic unity and to spirituality may embrace theism and atheism, vedantism and low ideas of idolatry. ‘Religion,’ of course, may be so defined as to be applicable to atheism, agnosticism, &amp;amp;c. Carlyle gave such a definition. But no one religion can claim at once to affirm and to deny God, to ignore Him and worship Him, to believe in Him as a subtle essence inconceivably fine, and to have &amp;lsquo;low ideas of idolatry.</description>

He has now returned to india, after an eventful journey. From what he has seen of Tibet and of Tibetan monasteries, he has reason to believe that the discovery of the Tibetan record of Christ’s life by the Russian traveler Notovitch, regarded by many critics as a fake, is not without truth.</description>

      <description>(Indian Mirror January 21, 1897) Swami Vivekananda was accorded a most enthusiastic reception at Colombo, where he landed on the 15th instant. All classes of the Colombo community, whether Hindus or Buddhists, forgot their differences, and went to work together to render fitting honour, where honour was so eminently due. The appreciation of his splendid record of work in the West is by no means confined to his brethren in the faith, for the fact of the Buddhists having co-operated with the Hindus in acknowledging the debt of gratitude, under which he has laid all followers of the several Eastern creeds, is a proof positive of his services having been estimated at their true worth, outside the ranks of Hinduism.</description>

To the Editor of The New York Times:
I have read the slashing letter of your correspondent, John Lincoln Blauss, on “Dropping into Buddhism” in your issue of May 24, and wish to submit the following in reply.
Mr. Blauss seems to imagine so “many vain things” and “knows so many things that are not so,” particularly about the Brooklyn Ethical Association, its Oriental friends, &amp;amp;c.</description>

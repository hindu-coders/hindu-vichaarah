To Balaram Bose
Glory to Ramakrishna
GHAZIPUR
February 6, 1890
RESPECTED SIR,
I have talked with Pavhari Baba. He is a wonderful saint — the embodiment of humility, devotion, and Yoga. Although he is an orthodox Vaishnava, he is not prejudiced against others of different beliefs. He has tremendous love for Mahāprabhu Chaitanya, and he [Pavhari Baba] speaks of Shri Ramakrishna as &amp;ldquo;an incarnation of God&amp;rdquo;.</description>

GHAZIPUR
February 11, 1890
RESPECTED SIR
I have received your book. In Hrishikesh, Kali [Swami Abhedananda] has had a relapse and is again suffering from what seems to be malaria. Once it comes, the fever does not easily leave those who have never had it before. I too suffered the same way when I first had the attack of fever.</description>

To Balaram Bose
Salutation to Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna
GHAZIPUR
February 1890
RESPECTED SIR,
I have received an anonymous letter which I have been unable to trace back to the gigantic soul who wrote it. Indeed, one should pay homage to such a man. He who considers a great soul like Pavhari Baba to be no more than water in a hoof print, he who has nothing to learn in this world and who feels it a disgrace to be taught by any other man — truly, such a new incarnation must be visited.</description>

A basket of roses will be sent to you in a few days at Chitpur. Do you please send them up immediately to Shashi [Swami Ramakrishnananda, at the Baranagore Math]. They would not be sent to the care of Balaram Basu, for there would be such nice delays and that would be death to the flowers. I think if sent to Chitpur, to your depot, it would reach you there at the very place; if not, write sharp.</description>

VI To Swami Saradananda
Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna
CALCUTTA
32 ASHADHA [JULY 15, 1890]
MY DEAR SHARAT
I am sorry to learn that [Vaikunthanath] Sanyal&amp;rsquo;s habits are as yet not Pucca [firm]; and what about Brahmacharya? I don&amp;rsquo;t understand you. If so, the best thing for you both is to come down and live here. The widow of Mohindra Mukherjee is trying head and heart to erect a Math for you, and Surendranath Mitra has left another thousand so that you are very likely soon to get a beautiful place on the river.</description>

MINNEAPOLIS
21 November 1893
DEAR MOTHER,
I reached Madison safely, went to a hotel, and sent a message to Mr. Updike. He came to see me. He is a Congregational and so, of course, was not very friendly at first; but in the course of an hour or so became very kind to me, and took me over the whole place and the University.</description>

DEAR MOTHER
I am still in Minneapolis. I am to lecture this afternoon, and the day after tomorrow go to Des Moines.
The day I came here they had their first snow, and it snowed all through the day and night, and I had great use for the arctics.</description>

IX To Mrs. G. W. Hale
DETROIT,
14 February 1894.
DEAR MOTHER,
Arrived safely night before last at 1 o&amp;rsquo;clock a.m. The train was seven hours late, being blocked by snowdrifts on the way. However, I enjoyed the novelty of the sight: several men cutting and clearing the snow and two engines tugging and pulling was a new sight to me.</description>

business and am trying hard to break loose. I have lost at least $5,000 by joining this man. Hope you are all well. Mrs. Bagley and her daughters are very kind to me. I hope to do some private lecturing here and then go to Ada and then back to Chicago. It is snowing here this morning. They are very nice people here, and the different clubs took a good deal of interest in me.</description>

and $100 as a present from a lady.
This sum will be sent to you tomorrow in cheques by Mrs. Bagley. Today, the banks being closed, we could not do it.
I am going tomorrow to lecture at Ada, Ohio. I do not know whether I will go to Chicago from Ada or not. However, kindly let not Slayton know anything about the rest of the money, as I am going to separate myself from him.</description>

The two younger daughters were waiting for me with a carriage. So everything was all right. I hope the lecture will be a success, as one of the girls said the tickets are selling like hot cakes. Here I found a letter from Mr. Palmer awaiting me with a request that I should come over to his house and be his guest.</description>

DEAR MOTHER,
Since my last, there has been nothing of interest here. Except that Mr. Palmer is a very hearty, jolly, good old man and very rich. He has been uniformly kind to me. Tomorrow I go back to Mrs. Bagley&amp;rsquo;s because I am afraid she is rather uneasy at my long stay here.</description>

I am in New York. The gentleman [Dr. Guernsey] whose guest I am is a very nice and learned and well-to-do man. He had an only son whom he lost last July. Has only a daughter now. The old couple have received a great shock, but they are pure and God-loving people and bear it manfully.</description>

DEAR MOTHER
I think I have all your questions answered and you are in good humour again.
I am enjoying this place very much; going to Greenacre today or tomorrow and on our way back I intend to go to Annisquam, to Mrs. Bagley&amp;rsquo;s — I have written to her.</description>

DEAR MOTHER
I have received your letter and am very much ashamed at my bad memory. I unfortunately forgot all about the cheque. Perhaps you have come to know by this time of my being in Greenacre. I had a very nice time here and am enjoying it immensely.</description>

I am all right, enjoying nice health, and the people here are very kind and nice to me. Up to date I had no occasion to cash any cheque as everything is going on smoothly. I have not heard anything from the Babies. Hope they are doing well.</description>

shows that the phonograph has not reached yet, and it was dated 8th June. So I do not think it is time yet to get an answer. I am not astonished at my friends&amp;rsquo; asking Cook &amp;amp; Sons to hunt for me; I have not written for a long time.
I have a letter from Madras which says they will soon send money to Narasimha (Narasimhacharya.</description>

Narasimha has perhaps got his passage by this time. He will get it soon, whether his family gives him the money or not. I have written to my friends in Madras to look to it, and they write me they will.
I would be very glad if he becomes a Christian or Mohammedan or any religion that suits him; but I am afraid for some time to come none will suit our friend.</description>

I do not know what to do. I send you therefore back this notice, and if they deliver it to you, all right — else I hope you will ask them to send it over to New York and kindly give them my address.
Yours obediently,

Many, many thanks for sending the coat. Now I am well equipped for summer. I am so sorry the rugs could not come before I leave this country. They will come if Dewanji is alive.

Your kind note duly reached. The books have arrived safe and more are coming. The Sanskrit books pay no duty, being classics. I expect a big package from Khetri.

DEAR MOTHER —
You did not write to me a single line for a long time. Neither did Sister Mary write about the duty paid on the rugs [from the Dewan of Junagadh]. I am afraid the rugs are small.

They will be here by the middle of this month. And if you see a letter with the Morris American Express Co. name on the envelope, tear it open. You need not forward it to me, for that will be the notice of arrival to Chicago. I am sure Dewanji&amp;rsquo;s carpets were too small, but why do you not write to me about the duty if you had to pay it?</description>

Many thanks for your kindly sending me several copies of the Light of the East. I wish the paper all success.
As you have asked for my suggestion [that] I can make towards improving the paper — I must frankly state that in my life-long experience in the work, I have always found &amp;ldquo;Occultism&amp;rdquo; injurious and weakening to humanity.</description>

I will be only too glad to come to Boston for the Harvard lecture especially — but these are the difficulties in the way: First, the work here will fall to pieces; secondly, I have begun to write in right earnest. I want to finish some text books to be the basis of work when I am gone. I want to hurry through four little text books before I go.</description>

SIR,
Allow me to put a few words in your estimable journal as comments on an article in your paper dated July 4th. I must thank you without reserve for the kind and friendly spirit manifested throughout the article towards me and the philosophy I preach; but, as there is a fear of misconstruction in one part of it — especially by my Spiritualistic friends — I want to clear my position.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED,
Surrounded on all sides by eternal snow peaks, sitting on the grass in a beautiful wood, my thoughts go to those I love — so I write.
I am in Switzerland — constantly on the move — getting a much needed rest. It is a miniature Himalayas, and has the same effect of raising the mind up to the Self and driving away all earthly feelings and ties.</description>

5 December 1896
DEAR MISS NOBLE —
Many thanks for sending the kind present from Mr. Beatty. I have written to him acknowledging his beautiful gift.
As for you, my dear, noble, kind friend, I only would say this — we Indians lack in many things, but there is none on earth to beat us in gratefulness.</description>

GENTLEMEN,
I have received your address with great pleasure and sincerely thank you for the kind expressions contained therein.
I much regret, however, that time effectually prevents my paying even a short visit to Trichinopoly at present. In the autumn, however, I propose making a lecture tour throughout India, and you may rely upon it that I shall then not fail to include Trichinopoly in the programme.</description>

DARJEELING,
[RETURN ADDRESS: ALAMBAZAR MATH, CALCUTTA]
16th March 1897.
DEAR CHRISTINA,
Many, many thanks for the photograph and the poem. I never saw anything half as beautiful. The work I had to do to reach Calcutta from Ceylon was so immense that I could not earlier acknowledge your precious gift. The work has broken me down completely, and I have got &amp;ldquo;diabetes&amp;rdquo;, an incurable disease, which must carry me off — at least in a few years.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL —
The demonstrations and national jubilations over me are over — at least I had to cut them short, as my health broke completely down. The result of this steady work in the West and the tremendous work of a month in India upon the Bengalee constitution is &amp;ldquo;diabetes&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DEAR RAM RAM,
I received your first letter in Calcutta. I was busy there, and so it seems that I forgot to reply. You have deplored this in your letter, but that is not right. I do not forget anyone — especially those who have received grace from &amp;ldquo;Him&amp;rdquo;.
While I was in England, I received your Avadhuta-Gitā.</description>

DEAR LALAJEE,
Just received your kind invitation through telegram. Perhaps you have already heard that I have been attacked by &amp;ldquo;Diabetes&amp;rdquo;, a fell disease.

Yours with blessings,

I haven&amp;rsquo;t received any word of your arrival yet. I heard that Alasinga has gone there with his relations by way of Jaipur. We stayed at the Binsar Dak Bungalow [rest-house] for two or three days, and then I left for Shyamdhura. At this, Miss [Henrietta] Müller got infuriated and left for Almora. Terribly upset, Miss Müller accused Shivananda of telling her first that I shall live with a friend as his guest and of renting later such a big house for the season at 80 rupees without consulting her.</description>

I am afraid you are getting roasted down there in the heat of Calcutta. Here it is nice and cool and rather chill when it rains, which it does almost every day.

With infinite sorrow I learn the sad news of Mr. Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s departure from this life, the more so as it was terribly sudden and therefore prevented all possibilities of my being at his side at the time of death. The debt of gratitude I owe him can never be repaid, and those who think they have been helped by any thought of mine ought to know that almost every word of it was published through the untiring and most unselfish exertions of Mr.</description>

It was a very enjoyable trip and the Darshana2 was glorious.
I will be here about a month more, then I return to the plains. Kindly ask Jagmohan to write to the Dewan Saheb of Kishangarh to get for me the copies of Nimbārka Bhāshya which he promised.
With all love,
Yours,

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
How are you? I am very anxious about your health. I have long not had any letter from you.
My health again failed badly. I had, therefore, to leave Kashmir in haste and come to Calcutta. The doctors say I ought not go tramping again this winter.</description>

MY DEAR NIVEDITA,
The address of my cousin is 127 Manicktala Street. The husband&amp;rsquo;s name is Durga Prasanna Bose. The wife&amp;rsquo;s name is most probably not known to the people you will meet in the male department. Therefore it is the custom to ask for the wife of so-and-so.
Manicktala Street is that which runs east and west, south of the tank garden.</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
I received your letter just now. I am now in New York. Dr. [Egbert] Guernsey analysed my urine yesterday, and there was no sugar or albumen in it. So my kidneys are all right, at least at present. The heart is only nervous, requires calming!</description>

180 WEST 59TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
12th November 1899.
CHRISTINA —
Mrs. Bull has gone to Boston without seeing me. I am with the Guernseys. All today laid up with colds.
Oh, these nasty colds. The doctor here declares my case as entirely one of nervous exhaustion. Even the dyspepsia is entirely nervous.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL —
I am laid up with a bad cold. The clothes are not ready — they will be next week. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what my next step will be. Dr. Guernsey is very kind. Several Doctors have examined me and none could detect any organic disease.</description>

21 WEST 34TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
21st November 1899.
MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
Circumstances have so fallen that I have to start for California tomorrow. It is for my physical benefit too; as the doctor says, I had better be off where the severe winter of the North cannot reach.
Well, thus my plans are made and marred.</description>

They have been very kind. Madame [Emma] Calvé‚ came to see me day before yesterday. She is a great woman.

MY DEAR MARGOT,
Two nights are passed — today the third will come. If it proves as pleasant and somnolent as the last two, I [shall] rejoice.
The scenery today I am passing through is much like the neighborhood of Delhi, the beginning of a big desert, bleak hills, scanty, thorny shrubs, very little water.</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
After all, it is good for me, and good for those I love, that I should come here. Here at last in California! One of our poets says: &amp;ldquo;Where is Benares, where is Kashmir, where Khorasan, where Gujarat! O Tulsi! thus, man&amp;rsquo;s past Karma drags him on&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DEAR CHRISTINA,
So you are awake and can&amp;rsquo;t go to sleep any more. Good! Keep awake, wide awake. It was good I came here. For, in the first place, I am cured. What do you think of this — able to walk, and every day walk three miles after a heavy dinner!</description>

NEW YORK,
3rd July 1900.
MY DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH —
This is to introduce Swami Turiyananda. The lady who gave the piece of land for Vedanta work belongs to Los Angeles. She has taken Turiyananda with her. He is a great spiritual teacher — but has no experience in platform work.
The best thing would be to help him to start a centre for quiet and rest and meditation in the land near San Jose.</description>

Things are going quite all right. Mr. Johnson has returned to their house, and all the rooms are full except two. You write to Mrs. Crane whether you want to get them or not.

DEAR CHRISTINE,
I am expecting a long, long letter from you; and, like all expectations of mine, [it] will not be realized, I fear.
Well, I need not bother you with the usual string of questions: How are you? What are you doing all this summer?</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,
I have been looking at one of your old photos — the only one you sent four or five years ago; and then I remember how changed and reduced you looked last summer; and it came to me that you must be awfully thin now, as it seems very hard for you to get rid of anxieties.</description>

DEAR CHRISTINE,
I could not write you last mail, excusez [excuse]. But I have been expecting one from you for a long time. Hope one will come this mail.

However, nothing in the world like a plump, ripe fruit.
I had to give up my trip to Japan: firstly, because I am not in a working trim yet; secondly, [I] don&amp;rsquo;t much care to make such a long voyage (one month) alone; thirdly, what am I to talk to them, I wonder.</description>

CCXXVII To Sister Christine
THE MATH, BELUR, DIST. HOWRAH,
21st June 1902.
MY DEAR CHRISTINE,
You have not the least cause to be anxious. I am getting on anyhow and am quite strong. As to diet, I find I have to restrict myself and not follow the prescription of my doctor to eat anything I like. The pills continue, however.</description>

Nivedita&rsquo;s Book</a> /</p>
<h2 id="chapter-ii">CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>AT NAINI TAL AND ALMORA</p>
<p>PERSONS: The Swami Vivekananda, Gurubhāis, and a party of Europeans and
disciples, amongst whom were Dhira Mata, the &ldquo;Steady Mother&rdquo;; one whose
name was Jaya; and Nivedita.</p>
<p>PLACE: The Himalayas.</p>
<p>TIME: May 11 to May 25, 1898.</p>
<p>We were a large party, or, indeed, two parties, that left Howrah station
on Wednesday evening and on Friday morning came in sight of the
Himalayas. . . .</p>
<p>Naini Tal was made beautiful by three things — the Master&rsquo;s pleasure in
introducing to us his disciple the Raja of Khetri; the dancing girls who
met us and asked us where to find him, and were received by him in spite
of the remonstrances of others; and by the Mohammedan gentleman who
said, &ldquo;Swamiji, if in after-times any claim you as an Avatāra, an
especial incarnation of the Deity — remember that I, a Mohammedan, am
the first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was here too that we heard a long talk on Ram Mohan Roy in which he
pointed out three things as the dominant notes of this teacher&rsquo;s message
— his acceptance of the Vedanta, his preaching of patriotism, and the
love that embraced the Mussulman equally with the Hindu. In all these
things he claimed himself to have taken up the task that the breadth and
foresight of Ram Mohan Roy had mapped out.</p>
<p>The incident of the dancing girls occurred in consequence of our visit
to the two temples at the head of the tarn. . . . Here, offering
worship, we found two nautch-women. When they had finished, they came up
to us, and we, in broken language, entered into conversation with them.
We took them for respectable ladies of the town and were much astonished
later at the storm which had evidently passed over the Swami&rsquo;s audience
at his refusal to have them turned away. Am I mistaken in thinking that
it was in connection with these dancing-women of Naini Tal that he first
told us the story, many times repeated, of the nautch-girl of Khetri? He
had been angry at the invitation to see her, but being prevailed upon to
come, she sang:</p>
<p>O Lord, look not upon my evil qualities!<br>
Thy name, O Lord, is Same-Sightedness.<br>
Make us both the same Brahman!<br>
One piece of iron is the knife in the hand of the butcher,<br>
And another piece of iron is the image in the temple.<br>
But when they touch the philosopher&rsquo;s stone,<br>
Both alike turn to gold!<br>
One drop of water is in the sacred Jamuna,<br>
And one is foul in a ditch by the roadside.<br>
But when they fall into the Ganges,<br>
Both alike become holy!<br>
So, Lord, look not upon my evil qualities!<br>
Thy name, O Lord, is Same-Sightedness.<br>
Make us both the same Brahman!</p>
<p>And then, said the Master of himself, the scales fell from his eyes, and
seeing that all are indeed one, he condemned no more. . . .</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when we left Naini Tal for Almora, and
night overtook us while still travelling through the forest. . . . till
we reached a quaintly placed Dak bungalow, on the mountain side in the
midst of trees. There after some time Swamiji arrived with his party,
full of fun and keen in his appreciation of everything that concerned
the comfort of his guests. . . .</p>
<p>From the day that we arrived at Almora the Swami renewed his habit of
coming over to us at our early breakfast and spending some hours in
talk. Then and always he was an exceedingly light sleeper, and I imagine
that his visit to us, early as the hour might be, was often paid during
the course of his return with his monks from a still earlier walk.
Sometimes, but rarely, we saw him again in the evening, either meeting
him when out for a walk or going ourselves to Captain Sevier&rsquo;s, where he
and his party were staying, and seeing him there. And once he came at
that time to call on us.</p>
<p>Into these morning talks at Almora a strange new element, painful but
salutary to remember, had crept. There appeared to be on the one side a
curious bitterness and distrust, and on the other, irritation and
defiance. The youngest of the Swami&rsquo;s disciples at this time, it must be
remembered, was an English woman, and of how much this fact meant
intellectually — what a strong bias it implied, and always does imply,
in the reading of India, what an idealism of the English race and all
their deeds and history — the Swami himself had had no conception till
the day after her initiation at the monastery. Then he had asked her
some exultant question, as to which nation she now belonged, and had
been startled to find with what a passion of loyalty and worship she
regarded the English flag, giving to it much of the feeling that an
Indian woman would give to her Thakur. His surprise and disappointment
at the moment were scarcely perceptible. A startled look, no more. Nor
did his discovery of the superficial way in which this disciple had
joined herself with his people in any degree affect his confidence and
courtesy during the remaining weeks spent in the plains.</p>
<p>But with Almora it seemed as if a going-to-school had commenced. . . .
It was never more than this; never the dictating of opinion or creed;
never more than emancipation from partiality. Even at the end of the
terrible experience when this method, as regarded race and country, was
renounced, never to be taken up systematically again, the Swami did not
call for any confession of faith, any declaration of new opinion. He
dropped the whole question. His listener went free. But he had revealed
a different standpoint in thought and feeling, so completely and so
strongly as to make it impossible for her to rest, until later, by her
own labours, she had arrived at a view in which both these partial
presentments stood rationalized and accounted for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, patriotism like yours is sin!&rdquo; he exclaimed once, many weeks
later, when the process of obtaining an uncoloured judgement on some
incident had been more than commonly exasperating. &ldquo;All that I want you
to see is that most people&rsquo;s actions are the expression of
self-interest, and you constantly oppose to this the idea that a certain
race are all angels. Ignorance so determined is wickedness!&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>These morning talks at Almora, then, took the form of assaults upon
deep-rooted preconceptions — social, literary and artistic — or of long
comparisons of Indian and European history and sentiments, often
containing extended observations of very great value. One characteristic
of the Swami was the habit of attacking the abuses of a country or
society openly and vigorously when he was in its midst, whereas after he
had left it, it would often seem as if nothing but its virtues were
remembered by him. He was always testing his disciples, and the manner
of these particular discourses was probably adopted in order to put to
the proof the courage and sincerity of one who was both woman and
European.</p>

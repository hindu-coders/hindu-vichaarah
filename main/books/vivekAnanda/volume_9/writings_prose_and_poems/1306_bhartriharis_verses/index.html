<p><em>This is Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s free translation of verses from
Bhartrihari&rsquo;s Sanskrit poem</em> Vairāgya Shatakam.</p>
<p><em>The Swami&rsquo;s translation is from Sister Nivedita&rsquo;s</em> Unpublished Notes of
Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda — <em>selected verses recorded
almost verbatim, but not necessarily in Bhartrihari&rsquo;s order, by Sister
Nivedita as Swami Vivekananda translated them orally for some of his
Western disciples during a Himalayan pilgrimage in 1898.</em></p>
<p><em>For the researcher&rsquo;s benefit, verses 14-15, 18, 24-26, 31, and 33 have
been footnoted as corresponding verses taken from Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s
original handwritten translation, which was given to the Vedanta Society
of Southern California by Miss Josephine MacLeod, shortly before her
passing away in 1948. This footnoted handwritten version was first
published in the collection of poetry entitled</em> In Search of God and
Other Poems <em>(Mayavati: Advaita Ashrama, 1968).</em></p>
<p><em>Stylistic differences in Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s overall translation of
Bhartrihari&rsquo;s poem are due to those variations inherent in the two
aforementioned sources. Obvious typographical and punctuation errors
have been corrected.</em></p>
<p><em>The verse numbers, as available, correspond to Bhartrihari&rsquo;s
numbering.</em></p>

<p>BHARTRIHARI&rsquo;S VERSES ON RENUNCIATION</p>
<p><em>[A translation of verses from Bhartrihari&rsquo;s Sanskrit poem</em> Vairagya
Shatakam*]*</p>
<p>I have travelled in many countries, hard to travel in,<br>
And got no result;<br>
Giving up pride of birth and position,<br>
I have served all.<br>
Like a crow stealing into a kitchen,<br>
With fear I have eaten the bread of others in their homes,<br>
Yet thou, Desire, who leadest to evil deeds,<br>
Leavest me not!</p>
<p>(Verse 2)</p>
<p>I have crossed oceans to find wealth.<br>
I have blasted mountains to get jewels.<br>
I have spent whole nights in graveyards<br>
repeating Mantras<br>
And have obtained — not the broken cowrie<br>
of blessedness<br>
Ah, Desire, give me up now.</p>
<p>(Verse 3)</p>
<p>I have borne the wicked words of the wicked;<br>
To please fools, when my heart is weeping,<br>
my lips ever laughed.<br>
Stopping my judgment, I have with folded hands<br>
Stood before unworthy persons.<br>
Even now, my Desire, why do you make me dance<br>
like a fool?</p>
<p>(Verse 4)</p>
<p>For this life, which is like a drop of water<br>
on a lotus leaf,<br>
We have not enjoyed, but enjoyments have enjoyed us.<br>
We did not penance, but penances burnt us up.<br>
Time did not fly, yet we are gone.<br>
We become decrepit with age, but not so Desire.<br>
Infirmity assails us, the skin wrinkles,<br>
The hair whitens, the body becomes crooked,<br>
Old age comes on.<br>
Desire alone grows younger every day.</p>
<p>(Verses 5-8)</p>
<p>Hope is the name of this river, whose water is Desire,<br>
And Thirst the waves thereof.<br>
Passion is the crocodile living in that water,<br>
Vain resolves are the birds that reside<br>
In the tree of virtue on the shores and kill it.<br>
But there are the whirlpools of Delusion<br>
And Despondence, the high banks.<br>
The great Yogis are blissful because they,<br>
With their pure minds, never crossed this river.</p>
<p>(Verse 10)</p>
<p>Blessed are they that, living even in the<br>
caves of mountains,<br>
Meditate on the supreme Light.<br>
Even the birds will fearlessly drink of the<br>
tears of pleasure<br>
That flow from their eyes.<br>
Alas, (Here Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s handwritten translation begins.) our
minds grow familiar, even in imagination,<br>
With palaces and pleasure — gardens,<br>
And thus our lives fleet by.</p>
<p>(Verse 14)</p>
<p>Even when the only food is gained by begging,<br>
and that is tasteless;<br>
One&rsquo;s bed, the dry earth;<br>
One&rsquo;s whole family, his own body;<br>
His only clothing, a ragged bit of cloth —<br>
Alas, alas, the desire for enjoyment does not leave a man.</p>
<p>(Verse 15)</p>
<p>Not knowing the power of flame, the insect falls into it.<br>
The fish swallows the bait, not knowing the hook inside.<br>
That, well aware of the vanity and dangers of the world,<br>
We cannot give it up —<br>
Such is the power of Delusion.</p>
<p>(Verse 18)</p>
<p>Have such places in the Himalayas become extinct<br>
That a man should go begging at others&rsquo; doors?<br>
Have the roots in the mountain forests all disappeared?<br>
Are the springs all dry?<br>
Are the trees all withered that bear sweet fruits<br>
And bark for garments<br>
That a man should look with fear on the face of a fool,<br>
Whose head is turned by a little wealth?<br>
(Lit., &ldquo;Whose eyebrows are dancing with the wind of the<br>
pride of a little wealth&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Verses 24-25)</p>
<p>Arise! Let us go into the forest<br>
Where pure roots and fruits will be our food,<br>
Pure water our only drink,<br>
Pure leaves our bed,<br>
And where the little-minded, the thoughtless,<br>
And those whose hearts are cramped with wealth<br>
Do not exist.</p>
<p>(Verse 26)</p>
<p>In enjoyment is the fear of disease;<br>
In high birth, the fear of losing caste;<br>
In wealth, the fear of tyrants;<br>
In honour, the fear of losing her;<br>
In strength, the fear of enemies;<br>
In beauty, the fear of the other sex;<a href="#fn2">2</a><br>
In knowledge, the fear of defeat;<br>
In virtue, the fear of scandal;<br>
In the body, the fear of death.<br>
In this life, all is fraught with fear.<br>
Renunciation alone is fearless.</p>
<p>(Verse 31)</p>
<p>The root of health has always round about it<br>
A thousand worms in the form of dangers and disease.<br>
Where fortune falls, open a hundred gates of danger.<br>
Whosoever is born, him death will surely swallow.<br>
Say, where is that Providence who ever created<br>
Anything that died not?</p>
<p>(Verse 33)<a href="#fn3">3</a></p>
<p>Life is like a wave upon the waters,<br>
Youth only remains a few days.<br>
Wealth is like a fancy of the mind,<br>
It immediately vanishes.<br>
Enjoyment is like a flash of lightning<br>
amongst dark clouds.<br>
Our most beloved one is only for a moment.<br>
Knowing this, O man, give your heart unto Brahman<br>
To cross this ocean of life.</p>
<p>(Verse 36)</p>
<p>. . . Living in whom gods like Indra, Brahmā<br>
and others appear like a blade of grass,<br>
Whose anger can destroy the worlds in a moment.<br>
O sage, know Him, that One Supreme<br>
Who dies not,<br>
And give not your mind to false enjoyment.</p>
<p>(Verse 40)</p>
<p>Ah, where is happiness in this life?</p>
<p>(At best it lasts but a hundred years, of which half is spent in sleep;
of the other half, half in decrepitude; of what remains — one half goes
in childhood and, of the rest, still half in serving others!)</p>
<p>O man, in this futile, wave-like life<br>
Where is happiness?</p>
<p>(Verse 49)</p>
<p>Now you appear as child<br>
And now as a youth, whose whole occupation is love.<br>
This moment poor, another wealthy,<br>
Now a babe, and again a decrepit old man.<br>
O actor man, at last you vanish from the stage<br>
When death beckons you behind the scenes!</p>
<p>(Verse 50)</p>
<p>You are a king, but we have served Gurus,<br>
Who are great in knowledge.<br>
You are known by your wealth as a king,<br>
We for our knowledge.<br>
There is infinite difference between us and you,<br>
Therefore we are not the persons to wait upon you,<br>
O Kings!</p>
<p>(Verse 51)</p>
<p>Oh, when will that day come,<br>
When in a forest, saying &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo;,<br>
My days shall pass?<br>
A serpent and a garland the same,<br>
The strong foe and the friend the same,<br>
The flower-bed and the stone-bed the same,<br>
A beautiful woman and a blade of grass the same!</p>
<p>(Verses 85, 90)</p>
<p>O Shiva, when shall I be able to cut<br>
To the very roots of my Karma,<br>
By becoming solitary, desireless, quiet —<br>
My hands my only plate, and the cardinal points<br>
my clothing?</p>
<p>(Verse 99)</p>
<p>The fruits are sufficient food,<br>
The waters of the mountain sufficient dinner,<br>
The earth a sufficient bed,<br>
And bark a sufficient garment —<br>
These are all welcome.<br>
Only I cannot bear the proud words of fools,<br>
Whose organs are all disordered by the drink<br>
Of the wine of new wealth!</p>
<p>(Verse 54)</p>
<p>What if you have got the wealth that fulfils every desire?<br>
If your foot is on the heads of your foes,<br>
What of that?<br>
If you have made all your love wealthy,<br>
If your body remains a Kalpa (A periodic cycle of creation and
dissolution.) — what of that?<br>
The only thing to be desired is Renunciation<br>
Which gives all love to Shiva.</p>
<p>(Verse 67)</p>
<p>Fear only life, that brings Birth and Death,<br>
Have no love of friends, no lust, no attachment.<br>
Alone, living alone in a forest,<br>
What is more to be longed for than this Renunciation.</p>
<p>(Verse 68)</p>
<p>Going searching in the lower regions,<br>
Going into the skies,<br>
Travelling through all the worlds,<br>
This is but the fickleness of the mind.<br>
Ah, friend, you never remember the Lord<br>
Who resides within you!<br>
How can you get happiness?</p>
<p>(Verse 70)</p>
<p>What is there in the reading of Vedas,<br>
The Shrutis, the Purānas and doing sacrifices?<br>
Freedom alone takes off the weight<br>
of this dreadful world,<br>
And manifests Self-blessedness.<br>
Here is the truth: the rest is all shop-keeping.</p>
<p>(Verse 71)</p>
<p>When the body is still healthy and diseaseless,<br>
When old age has not yet attacked it,<br>
When the organs have not yet lost their power,<br>
And life is still full and undiminished,<br>
Now, now, struggle on, rendering great help to yourself!<br>
My friend, it is useless to try to dig a well<br>
In a house that is already on fire!</p>
<p>(Verse 75)</p>
<p>In Shiva, who is the Lord of this Universe,<br>
Or Vishnu, its soul, I see no difference,<br>
But still, my love is for Him<br>
Who has the young moon on His forehead.</p>
<p>(Verse 84)</p>
<p>Oh when will that time come,<br>
When in a beautiful full-moon night,<br>
Sitting on the banks of some river,<br>
And in a calm, yet high notes repeating<br>
&ldquo;Shiva! Shiva! Shiva!&rdquo;<br>
All my feelings will come out through the eyes<br>
In the form of tears?</p>
<p>(Verse 85)</p>
<p>When, wearing only the Kaupina, (Loincloth.)<br>
Lying on the sands of the holy Ganges in Benares,<br>
When shall I weep aloud, &ldquo;O Lord of ghouls&rdquo;,<br>
Saying this, and whole days shall pass like moments?</p>
<p>(Verse 87)</p>
<p>When, bathing in the pure Ganges water,<br>
Worshipping Thee, Omnipresent, with holy fruits<br>
and flowers,<br>
Stretching myself on stones in a stony cave,<br>
My whole soul shall go into meditation,<br>
And according to the voice of my Guru,<br>
I shall avoid all misery, and purify<br>
The mind defiled with serving the rich.</p>
<p>(Verse 88)</p>
<p>This whole wide earth my bed,<br>
My beautiful pillows my own two arms,<br>
My wonderful canopy the blue sky,<br>
And the cool evening air to fan me,<br>
The moon and the stars my lamps,<br>
And my beautiful wife, Renunciation, by my side,<br>
What king is there who can sleep like me in pleasure?</p>
<p>(Verse 94)</p>
<p>This Universe is only a little circle.<br>
What is there to desire in it?<br>
Will the ocean go into waves<br>
By the jumping of a little [fish?]?</p>
<p>(Verse 92)</p>
<p>There was a time when I could see nothing but Women<br>
in this world:<br>
And now that my eyes are opened,<br>
I can see nothing but Brahman.<br>
Beautiful are the rays of the moon,<br>
Beautiful are the lawns in the forest,<br>
Beautiful is the meeting of the good,<br>
Beautiful is poetry, and<br>
Beautiful is the face of the beloved.<br>
But to me none of these are beautiful,<br>
Knowing that they are evanescent.</p>
<p>(Verse 79)</p>
<p>Oh mother earth, father wind,<br>
Friend light, sweetheart water,<br>
Brother sky,<br>
Here take my last salutation<br>
With folded hands!<br>
For today I am melting away into Brahman,<br>
Because my heart became pure,<br>
And all delusion vanished<br>
Thro&rsquo; the power of your good company.</p>
<p>(Verse 100)</p>
<p>Old age watches us, roaring like a tigress.<br>
Disease, like enemies, is striking us often.<br>
Life is flowing out like water from a broken jar.<br>
Curious still how men do evil deeds in this world!</p>
<p>(Verse 38)</p>
<p>Those beautiful cities.<br>
Those mighty monarchs.<br>
Those powerful nobles.<br>
Those learned assemblies.<br>
Those moon-faced women.<br>
Those proud princes.<br>
And those that sang their praises —<br>
They have all been swept away from the memory<br>
of man.<br>
My salutation, therefore, is to Time who works<br>
all these!</p>
<p>(Verse 41)</p>
<p>The sun by his coming and going every hour<br>
is lessening the life of man.<br>
Time flies without our knowledge,<br>
Crushed as we are by the load of many works.<br>
Seeing the evils of Birth, Old Age, Danger, and Death<br>
We are not afraid.<br>
Ah me, drinking the wine of delusion,<br>
The world has become mad.</p>
<p>(Verse 43)</p>
<p>I have not learnt that knowledge which defeats all<br>
opponents!<br>
Nor have been able, at the point of the sword,<br>
Which can cut thro&rsquo; an elephant&rsquo;s back,<br>
To send our glory even unto the skies;<br>
Nor, under the light of the full moon,<br>
Drunk the nectar of the budding lips of the Beloved.<br>
My youth is gone fruitless<br>
Like a lamp in an empty house.</p>
<p>(Verse 46)</p>

with the Swami Vivekananda (Calcutta: Bangiya Sahitya
Parishad, 1983) pp. 13-20, 41-42.</li>
<li><a href="#fn2_1">^</a>The literal Sanskrit translation is: &ldquo;In beauty there is
the fear of age&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="#fn3_1">^</a>Here ends Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s handwritten translation.
The edited version published in In Search of God and Other Poems
follows in this note:<br>
Alas our minds [dally but] in imagination with palaces and
pleasure gardens, and thus our lives are spent. [One&rsquo;s] only food
is by begging — and that too is tasteless; one&rsquo;s bed, the dry earth;
all of one&rsquo;s family, one&rsquo;s own body; and the only clothing a
tattered piece of cloth around the waist — alas, still the desire
for enjoyment does not leave a man.<br>
(Verses 14-15)<br>
Not knowing the power of flame,<br>
The insect falls into it.<br>
The fish swallows the bait,<br>
Not knowing the hook inside.<br>
And knowing full well the vanities and dangers of the world. We
cannot give it up —<br>
Such is the power of delusion.<br>
[With rocks cooled by] the spray of the Ganga&rsquo;s waters,<br>
Where the Vidyādharas love to sport —<br>
Have such places in the Himalayas become extinct<br>
That a man should beg (in disgrace) at other&rsquo;s doors?<br>
(Verse 18, 24)<br>
Have the roots in the mountain forests all disappeared?<br>
Are the springs all dry? Are the trees all withered<br>
That bear sweet fruits and bark for garments<br>
That a man should look with fear on the face<br>
Of the fool, whose eyebrows are dancing<br>
[In] the wind of the pride of a little wealth?<br>
(Verse 25)<br>
Arise, let us go into the forest, where pure roots and fruits will
be our food, pure water our only drink, and pure leaves our bed —
And where the little-minded, the thoughtless, and those whose hearts
are cankered with wealth do not exist.<br>
(Verse 26)<br>
In enjoyment is the fear of disease,<br>
In high birth, the fear of losing caste,<br>
In wealth, the fear of tyrants,<br>
In honour the fear of losing [it],<br>
In strength, the fear of enemies,<br>
In beauty, the fear of [old age],<br>
In knowledge, the fear of defeat,<br>
In virtue, the fear of scandal,<br>
In the body, the fear of death,<br>
In this life all is fraught with fear:<br>
Renunciation alone is fearless.<br>
(Verse 31)<br>
[A person&rsquo;s] health [is uprooted by] thousands of [worries]
and disease. Where fortune falls upon a hundred gates of danger.
Whosoever is born, him death will surely swallow. Say, [has]
Providence ever created anything that died not?<br>
(Verse 33)</li>

This article first appeared anonymously in the February 1895 issue of the New York Medical Times, a prestigious monthly medical journal founded and edited by Dr. Egbert Guernsey.
Classification or grouping of phenomena by their similarities is the first step in scientific knowledge — perhaps it is all. An organized grouping, revealing to us a similarity running through the whole group, and a conviction that under similar circumstances the group will arrange itself in the same form — stretched over all time, past, present and future — is what we call law.</description>

[An undated and untitled, one-page manuscript in Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s own handwriting]
My nerves act on my brain — the brain sends back a reaction which, on the mental side, is this world.
Something — x — acts on the brain through the nerves, the reaction is this world.
Why not the x be also in the body — why outside?</description>

Probably at the turn of the century, Miss Ellen Waldo gave these undated notes in Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s handwriting to her friend Sister Devamata, a member of the Boston Vedanta Centre, where they were later made available for publication.
Man will need a religion so long as he is constituted as at present.

After his experience of the macrocosm within the microcosm while absorbed in meditation under the peepul tree at Kakrighat, in 1890, Swami Vivekananda jotted down in Bengali fragments of his realization in his notebook.
In the beginning was the Word etc.
The microcosm and the macrocosm are built on the same plan. Just as the individual soul is encased in the living body, so is the universal Soul in the Living Prakriti [Nature] — the objective universe.</description>

In 1889, Swami Vivekananda translated into Bengali selections from Book I, chapters 1-6 of Thomas à Kempis&amp;rsquo;s The Imitation of Christ. They were published along with a preface in a now-defunct Bengali monthly magazine, Sāhitya Kalpadruma. The Swami&amp;rsquo;s preface and Bengali translation, entitled &amp;ldquo;Ishānusharana&amp;rdquo;,1 were later published in the Bengali Complete Works (first edition), VI, pp. 16-28. However, only the preface to The Imitation of Christ was published in the English edition of the Complete Works, VIII.</description>

Om Salutations to Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna
Brothers of Calcutta!
1. We feel happy when you are happy, and we suffer when you suffer. Therefore, during these days of extreme adversity, we are striving and ceaselessly praying for your welfare and an easy way to save you from disease and the fear of an epidemic.
2. If that grave disease — fearing which both the high and the low, the rich and the poor are all fleeing the city — ever really comes in our midst, then even if we perish while serving and nursing you, we will consider ourselves fortunate because you are all embodiments of God.</description>

[A fragmentary poem composed at Ridgely Manor, in 1899]
One circle more the spiral path of life ascends
And time&amp;rsquo;s restless shuttle — running back and fro
Through maze of warp and woof
of shining
threads of life — spins out a stronger piece. (Cf. a slightly different version of the first three lines of this poem which appeared in Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s own handwriting on the left-hand side of the folded letter paper containing the original draft (Vide the facsimile ):</description>

He who was praised by the Brāhmanas, those knowers of the Vedas who made the sky reverberate with the sacred sounds of the sacrifice and caused the darkness of delusion to vanish through well-performed rituals and the knowledge known as Vedanta — he whose greatness was sung in the sweet chants of the Sāma-Veda etc.</description>

From life to life I am waiting here at the gates — they
open not.
My tongue is parched with ceaseless prayers and dim
my eyes have grown
With constant straining through the gloom to catch
one ray long sought;
My heart is seized with dark despair, all hope well-
nigh has flown.

This is Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s free translation of verses from Bhartrihari&amp;rsquo;s Sanskrit poem Vairāgya Shatakam.
The Swami&amp;rsquo;s translation is from Sister Nivedita&amp;rsquo;s Unpublished Notes of Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda — selected verses recorded almost verbatim, but not necessarily in Bhartrihari&amp;rsquo;s order, by Sister Nivedita as Swami Vivekananda translated them orally for some of his Western disciples during a Himalayan pilgrimage in 1898.</description>

eds. <em>Vivekananda in Indian Newspapers:</em> 1893-1902. Calcutta:
Dineshchandra Basu, Basu Bhattacharya and Co., 1969.</p>
<p><em>1.         From Mrs. Prince Woods&rsquo;s description of Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s
departure from the Woods&rsquo;s residence in Salem, Massachusetts, in August
1893. Swami Vivekananda gave his staff, his most precious possession, to
Dr. Woods, who was at that time a young medical student, and his trunk
and his blanket to Mrs. Kate T. Woods, saying:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my most precious possessions should I give to my friends who have
made me at home in this great country.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 1: 42)</p>
<p><em>2.         On the back of Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s transcription from Louis
Rousselet&rsquo;s book</em> India and Its Native Princes — Travels in Central
India and in the Presidencies of Bombay and Bengal, <em>dated February 11,
1894:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I say there is but one remedy for one too anxious for the future — to
go down on his knees.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 1: 225)</p>
<p><em>3.         An extract from a prayer Swami Vivekananda delivered at the
Chicago World&rsquo;s Parliament of Religions:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art He that beareth the burdens of the universe; help me to bear
the little burden of this life.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 2: 32)</p>
<p><em>4.         An extract from another prayer offered by Swami Vivekananda
at the Chicago World&rsquo;s Parliament of Religions:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;At the head of all these laws, in and through every particle of matter
and force, stands One through whose command the wind blows, the fire
burns, the clouds rain, and death stalks upon the earth. And what is His
nature? He is everywhere the pure and formless One, the Almighty and the
All Merciful. Thou art our Father. Thou art our beloved Friend.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em>
2: 33)</p>
<p><em>5.         From Mary T. Wright&rsquo;s journal entry dated Saturday, May 12,
1894:</em></p>
<p>The widows of high caste in India do not marry, he said; only the widows
of low caste may marry, may eat, drink, dance, have as many husbands as
they choose, divorce them all, in short enjoy all the benefits of the
highest society in this country. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When <em>we</em> are fanatical&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;we torture ourselves, we throw
ourselves under huge cars, we cut our throats, we lie on spiked beds;
but when <em>you</em> are fanatical you cut other people&rsquo;s throats, you torture
them by fire and put <em>them</em> on spiked beds! You take very good care of
your own skins!&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 2: 58-59)</p>
<p><em>6.         An 1894 extract from the Greenacre Voice, quoting one of the
Swami&rsquo;s teachings delivered at Greenacre, Maine:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I and everything in the universe are that Absolute, not parts,
but the whole. You are the whole of that Absolute.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 2: 150)</p>
<p><em>7.         In a March 5, 1899 letter from Sister Nivedita to Miss
Josephine MacLeod:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at heart a mystic, Margot, all this reasoning is only apparent — I
am really always on the lookout for signs and things — and so I never
bother about the fate of my initiations. If they want to be Sannyāsins
badly enough I feel that the rest is not my business. Of course it has
its bad side. I have to pay dearly for my blunder sometimes — but it has
one advantage. It has kept me still a Sannyasin through all this — and
that is my ambition, to die a real Sannyasin as Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
actually was — free from lust — and desire of wealth, and thirst for
fame. That thirst for fame is the worst of all filth.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 3: 128-29)</p>
<p><em>8.         From John Henry Wright&rsquo;s March 27, 1896 letter to Mary
Tappan Wright, in which Swami Vivekananda stated that England is just
like India with its castes:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to have separate classes for the two castes. For the high caste
people — Lady This and Lady That, Honourable This and Honourable That —
I had classes in the morning; for the low caste people, who came
pell-mell, I had classes in the evening.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 4: 73)</p>
<p><em>9.         While Swami Vivekananda was offering flowers at the feet of
the Virgin Mary in a small chapel in Switzerland in the summer of 1896,
he said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;For she also is the Mother.&rdquo; (<em>ND</em> 4: 276)</p>
<p><em>10.       From Mr. J. J. Goodwin&rsquo;s October 23, 1896 letter to Mrs. Ole
Bull, quoting Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s conversation at Greycoat Gardens in
London</em></p>

called union. And union is greater than love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not <em>love</em> religion. I have become identified with it. It is my
life. So no man loves that thing in which his life has been spent, in
which he really has accomplished something. That which we love is not
yet ourself. Your husband did not love music for which he had always
stood. He loved engineering in which as yet he knew comparatively
little. This is the difference between Bhakti and Jnana; and this is why
Jnana is greater than Bhakti.&rdquo; (<em>LSN</em> I: 216)</p>

been wrong so often and he has always been right, and now I trust his

is to help, but is spending hours every day in trying to solve the
methods. That what he had known hitherto is for men living in a cave —
alone, undisturbed — but now he will give &ldquo;humanity something that will

by a thorny branch which he had held aside for himself to pass. When the
Swami expostulated, the Rajput laughed the matter aside. &ldquo;Are we not
always the defenders of the faith, Swamiji?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&rdquo;, said the Swami, telling the story, &ldquo;I was just going to tell
him that they ought not to show such honour to the Sannyasin, when
suddenly I thought that perhaps they were right after all. Who knows?
Maybe I too am caught in the glare of this flashlight of your modern
civilization, which is only for a moment&rdquo;.</p>

to his mind the wandering Sādhu of earlier years, who had scattered his
knowledge and changed his name as he went, had been greater than the
abbot of Belur, burdened with much work and many cares. &ldquo;I have become
entangled.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 43)</p>

my whole life ever so filled me with the sense of work to be done. It
was as if I were <em>thrown out</em> from that life in caves to wander to and
fro in the plains below&rdquo;. And again he said to someone, &ldquo;It is not the
form of his life that makes a Sadhu. For it is possible to sit in a cave

<p>&ldquo;Go thou and follow Him, who was born and gave His life for others <em>five
hundred times</em> before He attained the vision of the Buddha!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1:
114)</p>
<p><em>72.       Upon returning from a pilgrimage in Kashmir:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;These gods are not merely symbols! They are the forms that the Bhaktas
have seen!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 120)</p>
<p><em>73.       Sister Nivedita&rsquo;s reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s words
heard long before:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Impersonal God seen through the mists of sense is personal.&rdquo;
(<em>CWSN</em> 1: 120)</p>
<p><em>74.       Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s comment when he was reminded of the
rareness of criminality in India:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Would God it were otherwise in my land, for this is verily the
virtuousness of death!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 123)</p>
<p><em>75.       Swami Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of life is only a swan song! Never forget those lines:</p>
<p>The lion, when stricken to the heart,<br>
gives out his mightiest roar.<br>
When smitten on the head, the cobra lifts its hood.<br>
And the majesty of the soul comes forth,<br>
only when a man is wounded to his depths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<em>CWSN</em> 1: 124)</p>
<p><em>76.       After hearing of the death of Shri Durga Charan Nag (Nag
Mahashay):</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;[He] was one of the greatest of the works of Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 129)</p>
<p><em>77.       About Shri Ramakrishna&rsquo;s transformative power, Swami
Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a joke that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa should touch a life? Of
course he made new men and new women of those who came to him, even in
these fleeting contacts!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 130)</p>
<p><em>78.       While speaking on the true spirit of a Sannyasin, Swami
Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw many great men in Hrishikesh. One case that I remember was that
of a man who seemed to be mad. He was coming nude down the street, with
boys pursuing and throwing stones at him. The whole man was bubbling
over with laughter while blood was streaming down his face and neck. I
took him and bathed the wound, putting ashes on it to stop the bleeding.
And all the time with peals of laughter he told me of the fun the boys
and he had been having, throwing the stones. &lsquo;So the Father plays&rsquo;, he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of these men hide, in order to guard themselves against intrusion.
People are a trouble to them. One had human bones strewn about his cave
and gave it out that he lived on corpses. Another threw stones. And so
on. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the thing comes upon them in a flash. There was a boy, for
instance, who used to come to read the Upanishads with Abhedananda. One
day he turned and said, &lsquo;Sir, is all this really true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo; said Abhedananda, &lsquo;It may be difficult to realize, but it is
certainly true&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next day, that boy was a silent Sannyasin, nude, on his way to
Kedarnath!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to him? you ask. He became silent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Sannyasin needs no longer to worship or to go on pilgrimage or
perform austerities. What then is the motive of all this going from
pilgrimage to pilgrimage, shrine to shrine, and austerity to austerity?
He is acquiring merit and giving it to the world!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 133)</p>
<p><em>79.       Referring to the story of Shibi Rana:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes! These are the stories that are deep in our nation&rsquo;s heart!
Never forget that the Sannyasin takes two vows: one to realize the truth
and one to help the world — and that the most stringent of stringent
requirements is that he should renounce any thought of heaven!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em>
1: 134)</p>
<p><em>80.       To Sister Nivedita:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gitā says that there are three kinds of charity: the Tāmasic, the
Rājasic and the Sāttvic. Tamasic charity is performed on an impulse. It
is always making mistakes. The doer thinks of nothing but his own
impulse to be kind. Rajasic charity is what a man does for his own
glory. And Sattvic charity is that which is given to the right person,
in the right way, and at the proper time. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to the Sattvic, I think more and more of a certain great
Western woman in whom I have seen that quiet giving, always to the right
person in the right way, at the right time, and never making a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my own part, I have been learning that even charity can go too far.
. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I grow older I find that I look more and more for greatness in
<em>little</em> things. I want to know what a great man eats and wears, and how
he speaks to his servants. I want to find a Sir Philip Sidney (Sir
Philip Sidney (1554-1586): English poet, soldier and politician.)
greatness! Few men would remember the thirst of others, even in the
moment of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But anyone will be great in a great position! Even the coward will grow
brave in the glare of the footlights. The world looks on. Whose heart
will not throb? Whose pulse will not quicken till he can do his best?</p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more the true greatness seems to me that of the worm doing its
duty silently, steadily, from moment to moment and from hour to hour.&rdquo;
(<em>CWSN</em> 1: 137)</p>
<p><em>81.       Referring to the great individual — the divine incarnation,
the Guru, and the Rishi:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not yet understand India! We Indians are man — worshippers,
after all! Our God is man!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 144)</p>
<p><em>82.       On another occasion, Swami Vivekananda used the word
&ldquo;man-worshippers&rdquo; in an entirely different sense:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;This idea of man—worship exists in nucleus in India, but it has never
been expanded. You must develop it. Make poetry, make art, of it.
Establish the worship of the feet of beggars as you had it in Mediaeval
Europe. Make man-worshippers.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 144-45)</p>
<p><em>83.       To Sister Nivedita:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a peculiar sect of Mohammedans who are reported to be so
fanatical that they take each newborn babe and expose it, saying, &lsquo;If
God made thee, perish! If Ali made thee, live!&rsquo; Now this, which they say
to the child, I say, but in the opposite sense, to you tonight: &lsquo;Go
forth into the world and there, if I made you, be destroyed! If Mother
made you, live&rsquo;!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 151)</p>
<p><em>84.       Long after Southern magnates in America had apologized to
Vivekananda when they learned that he had been mistaken for a Negro and
was thus refused admission into hotels, the Swami remarked to himself:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What! rise at the expense of another! I didn&rsquo;t come to earth for that!
. . . If I am grateful to my white-skinned Aryan ancestor, I am far more
so to my yellow-skinned Mongolian ancestor and, most so of all, to the
black-skinned Negritoid!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 153)</p>
<p><em>85.       Commenting on the dungeon-cages of mediaeval prisoners on
Mont-Saint-Michel:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful place for meditation!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 154)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know I have wandered over the whole earth, but in India I have
looked for nothing save the cave in which to meditate!&rdquo; (Ibid.)</p>
<p><em>86.       Though he considered offspring of the Roman Empire to be
brutal and the Japanese notion of marriage a horror, Swami Vivekananda
nevertheless summed up the constructive ideals, never the defects, of a
community:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;For patriotism, the Japanese! For purity, the Hindu! And for manliness,
the European! There is no other in the world who understands, as does
the Englishman, what should be the glory of a man!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 160)</p>
<p><em>87.       Swami Vivekananda said of himself before he left for America
in 1893:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I go forth to preach a religion of which Buddhism is nothing but a
rebel child and Christianity, with all her pretensions, only a distant
echo!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 161)</p>
<p><em>88.       Describing the night Buddha left his wife to renounce the
world, Swami Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the problem that vexed him? Why! It was she whom he was about
to sacrifice for the world! That was the struggle! He cared nothing for
himself!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 172)</p>
<p><em>89.       After describing Buddha&rsquo;s touching farewell to his wife, the
Swami said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never thought of the hearts of the heroes? How they were
great, great, great — and soft as butter?&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 172)</p>
<p><em>90.       Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s description of Buddha&rsquo;s death and its
similarity with that of Shri Ramakrishna&rsquo;s:</em></p>
<p>He told how the blanket had been spread for him beneath the tree and how
the Blessed One had lain down, &ldquo;resting on his right side like a lion&rdquo;
to die, when suddenly there came to him one who ran for instruction. The
disciples would have treated the man as an intruder, maintaining peace
at any cost about their Master&rsquo;s death-bed, but the Blessed One
overheard, and saying, &ldquo;No, no! He who was sent (Lit., “the Tathāgata”.
“A word”, explained Swami Vivekananda, “which is very like your
‘Messiah’”.) is ever ready&rdquo;, he raised himself on his elbow and taught.
This happened four times and then, and then only, Buddha held himself
free to die. &ldquo;But first he spoke to reprove Ananda for weeping. The
Buddha was not a person but a realization, and to that any one of them
might attain. And with his last breath he forbade them to worship any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal story went on to its end. But to one who listened, the most
significant moment had been that in which the teller paused — at his own
words &ldquo;raised himself on his elbow and taught&rdquo; — and said, in brief
parenthesis, &ldquo;<em>I</em> saw this, you know, in the case of Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa&rdquo;. And there rose before the mind the story of one, destined
to learn from that teacher, who had travelled a hundred miles, and
arrived at Cossipore only when he lay dying. Here also the disciples
would have refused admission, but Shri Ramakrishna intervened, insisting
on receiving the new-comer, and teaching him. (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 175-176)</p>
<p><em>91.       Commenting on the historic and philosophic significance of
Buddhistic doctrine:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Form, feeling, sensation, motion and knowledge are the five categories
in perpetual flux and fusion. And in these lies Maya. Of any one wave
nothing can be predicated, for it is not. It but was and is gone. <em>Know,
O Man, thou art the sea!</em> Ah, this was Kapila&rsquo;s philosophy, but his
great disciple [Buddha] brought the heart to make it live!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1:
176)</p>
<p><em>92.       Concerning the Buddhist First Council and the dispute as to
its President:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you <em>imagine</em> what their strength was? One said it should be
Ananda, because he had loved Him most. But someone else stepped forward
and said no! for Ananda had been guilty of weeping at the death-bed. And
so he was passed over!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 177)</p>
<p><em>93.       Considering reincarnation a &ldquo;scientific speculation&rdquo; rather
than an article of faith:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, one life in the body is like a million years of confinement, and
they want to wake up the memory of many lives! Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof! . . . Yes! Buddhism must be right! Reincarnation is
only a mirage! But this vision is to be reached by the path of Advaita
alone!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 180-81)</p>
<p><em>94.</em>       &ldquo;Had I lived in Palestine, in the days of Jesus of Nazareth,
I would have washed his feet, not with my tears, but with my heart&rsquo;s
blood!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 189)</p>
<ol start="95">
<li>
<pre><code>  &quot;For the Advaitin, therefore, the *only* motive is love. . . .
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the Saviour who should go on his way rejoicing, not the saved!&rdquo;
(<em>CWSN</em> 1: 197-98)</p>
<p><em>96.       On the necessity of restraint in a disciple&rsquo;s life:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Struggle to realize yourself without a trace of emotion! . . . Watch
the fall of the leaves, but gather the sentiment of the sight from
within at some later time!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 207)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind! No loaves and fishes! No glamour of the world! All this must be
cut short. It must be rooted out. It is sentimentality—the overflow of
the senses. It comes to you in colour, sight, sound, and associations.
Cut it off. Learn to hate it. It is utter poison!&rdquo; (Ibid., 207-208)</p>
<p><em>97.       On the value of types:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Two diffferent races mix and fuse, and out of them rises one strong
distinct type. A strong and distinct type is always the physical basis
of the horizon. It is all very well to talk of universalism, but the
world will not be ready for that for millions of years!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember! if you want to know what a ship is like, the ship has to be
specified as it is — its length, breadth, shape, and material. And to
understand a nation, we must do the same. India <em>is</em> idolatrous. You
must help her <em>as she is</em>. Those who have left her can do nothing for
her!&rdquo; (CWSN 1: 209)</p>
<p><em>98.       Describing the Indian ideal of Brahmacharya in the student&rsquo;s
life, Swami Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Brahmacharya should be like a burning fire within the veins!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em>
1: 216)</p>
<p><em>99.       Concerning marriage by arrangement instead of choice, Swami
Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such pain in this country! Such pain! Some, of course, there
must always have been. But now the sight of Europeans with their
different customs has increased it. Society knows that there is another
way!</p>
<p>[To a European] &ldquo;We have exalted motherhood and you, wifehood; and I
think both might gain by some interchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In India the wife must not dream of loving even a son as she loves her
husband. She must be Sati. But the husband ought not to love his wife as
he does his mother. Hence a reciprocated affection is not thought so
high as one unreturned. It is &lsquo;shopkeeping&rsquo;. The joy of the contact of
husband and wife is not admitted in India. This we have to borrow from
the West. Our ideal needs to be refreshed by yours. And you, in turn,
need something of our devotion to motherhood.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 221-22)</p>
<p><em>100.     Speaking to a disciple with great compassion:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not mind if these shadows of home and marriage cross your mind
sometimes. Even to me, they come now and again!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 222)</p>
<p><em>101.     On hearing of the intense loneliness of a friend:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Every worker feels like that at times!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 222)</p>
<p><em>102.     Concerning the Hindu and Buddhist monastic and non-monastic
ideals:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The glory of Hinduism lies in the fact that while it has defined
ideals, it has never dared to say that any one of these alone was the
one true way. In this it differs from Buddhism, which exalts monasticism
above all others as the path that must be taken by all souls to reach
perfection. The story given in the Mahābhārata of the young saint who
was made to seek enlightenment, first from a married woman and then from
a butcher, is sufficient to show this. &lsquo;By doing my duty&rsquo;, said each one
of these when asked, &lsquo;by doing my duty in my own station, have I
attained this knowledge&rsquo;. There is no career then which might not be the
path to God. The question of attainment depends only, in the last
resort, on the thirst of the soul.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 223)</p>
<p><em>103.     With reference to the idea that the lover always sees the
ideal in the beloved, Swami Vivekananda responded to a girl&rsquo;s newly
avowed love:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cling to this vision! As long as you can both see the ideal in one
another, your worship and happiness will grow more instead of less.&rdquo;
(<em>CWSN</em> 1: 224)</p>
<p><em>104.</em>     &ldquo;The highest truth is always the simplest.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 226)</p>
<p><em>105.     Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s remarks on American séances:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Always the greatest fraud by the simplest means.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 233)</p>
<p><em>106.     On Western and Eastern views of a person as a body or a soul:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Western languages declare that man is a body and has a soul; Eastern
languages declare that he is a soul and has a body.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 236-37)</p>
<p><em>107.     Concerning Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s reverence for his Guru:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can criticize even an Avatāra [divine incarnation] without the
slightest diminution of my love for him! But I know quite well that most
people are not so; and for them it is safest to protect their own
Bhakti!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 252)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is the devotion of the dog! I don&rsquo;t want to know why! I am
contented simply to follow!&rdquo; (Ibid., 252-53)</p>
<p><em>108.</em>     &ldquo;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to begin every day by walking
about in his room for a couple of hours, saying &lsquo;Satchidānanda!&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Shivoham!&rsquo; or some other holy word.&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em> 1: 255)</p>
<p><em>109.     A few months before his passing away, Swami Vivekananda said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;How often does a man ruin his disciples by remaining always with them!
When men are once trained, it is essential that their leader leaves
them; for without his absence they cannot develop themselves!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em>
1: 260)</p>
<p><em>110.     A few days before his passing away, the Swami said:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am making ready for death. A great Tapasyā and meditation has come
upon me, and I am making ready for death.&rdquo; (CWSN 1: 261-62)</p>
<p><em>111.     In Kashmir after an illness, Swami Vivekananda said as he
lifted a couple of pebbles:</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever death approaches me, all weakness vanishes. I have neither
fear, nor doubt, nor thought of the external. I simply busy myself
making ready to die. I am as hard as <em>that</em> [the pebbles struck one
another in his hand] — for I <em>have</em> touched the feet of God!&rdquo; (<em>CWSN</em>
1: 262)</p>

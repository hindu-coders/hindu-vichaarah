  <h2 id="we-shifted-to-other-places">WE SHIFTED TO OTHER PLACES</h2>
<p>We then began to consider how to act next. Having thought over the matter, we made up our
mind to select an open space within the city and to train our boys there. We, therefore, hired the
open piece&rsquo; of ground belonging to Londhe for Rs. 2 per month, and having placed the image of
Maruti therein prepared a wrestling ground in front of the image. Here we used to teach the
following exercises : Wrestling, dandpatta, kathi, lance exercise, high and wide jumping and boxing.</p>
<p>4 to 6 in the evening was the appointed time. We also used to teach drill. This went on for nearly a
month and a half, but differences having afterwards arisen between the owner of the ground and
ourselves, we were obliged to leave it. We then began to search for some other place, when we
came to know that there was a (suitable) place in the wada of Khasgiwale who lives in the
Jogeshwari&rsquo;s Bol and that he was willing to give it to us. On receiving this information we made
inquiries about the ground, and found that it was extensive and secluded as we desired. The most
convenient thing about this ground was that no rent was to be charged for it.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-taught">WHAT WE TAUGHT</h2>
<p>The place being out of repairs, we took much pains to put it in order. We whitewashed it and
having placed (an image of) Maruti in a niche in the middle, hung portraits of warriors on all sides.
We had made it a rule to hang (in our gymnasium) the portraits of warriors alone, portraits of women
being prohibited. We (also) collected historical works containing accounts of warriors and
established a library at the place, and it was by putting forward the name of this institution that we
became known there. Here we admitted only such boys as were considered by us to be of
undoubted rectitude. About fifteen boys joined (this institution). They were asked to attend in the
morning for exercise, while we used to teach dandpatta, kathi, etc., during noon. In the evening at 5
o&rsquo;clock, one of us
two brothers used to give historical readings. Selecting some episode in ancient history, we used to
dilate upon it in a way suited to impress upon the minds of the boys a sense of self-respect and love
for one&rsquo;s religion, and to show how easy a matter it was to lay down one&rsquo;s life for these. Whenever,
in the course of these readings, we came across descriptions of battles containing such terms and
expressions as Morchebandi, khandak, ganimi-kava, and chhapa, as well as the names of arms, we
explained them with sufficient clearness to make them understood.</p>
<p>We also used to enter on
religious disquisitions at intervals, in order to prevent the social views of the boys from undergoing
any deviation from the precepts of the Shastras as well as from the prevalent custom. With a view to
confirm the boys in their hostility towards the reformers, we used to comment severely upon the
latter in the course of these disquisitions. At the conclusion of these readings arti was performed
before the Maruti and all of us closed our eyes and concentrated our minds on the valour-inspiring
image of Hanuman. Such was our programme until sunset.</p>
<p>At night we two brothers disguised
ourselves and went round the different streets to suit our actions to our disguise. At the conclusion
of our gymnastic exercises, we used to give to our boys moistened grampulse with pieces of dried
coconut-kernel to eat. All the boys had instructions to bring in pulse, pieces of dried cocoanut-
kernel, historical books, old weapons, old manuscripts, old or new clothes, (in short) everything that
they could find and that could be of use to the club. Whether good or bad, this course was adopted
by us and enforced as a rule in order to make a collection of good and useful articles. This enabled
us to stock our library with many such things. Then, in order to keep all those things in good order,
we (gave them in charge of some boys) assigned to each of them his duty and made him
responsible for his work.</p>
<p>The place had a large gate, but we kept it closed and used the dindi alone
for our purpose. A bell was hung inside and its string was left hanging outside. Each of the boys had
been given a number. Whenever a boy came to the gate, he rang the bell by pulling the string ; then
those inside asked him his number, and if satisfied (of his identity) they opened the gate. We named
this club &quot; Rashtra Hitechhu Mandali.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had a loathing for the game of cricket. We intensely hated
the boys who, laying aside our one thousand games, had shown a predilection for that game, as
well as those teachers who had encouraged them to do so. With a view to accustom our boys to
fighting without needlessly troubling any one, we used to send a batch of five or six of our boys to
the place where cricket was being played. These boys were to make away with the cricket things of
the players in a skilful manner. Sometimes the boys had to fight for the kit, and sometimes they
made away with it without having to fight.</p>
<h2 id="tirade-against-reformist-marriage">TIRADE AGAINST REFORMIST MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>It then began to be talked abroad that one Chapekar was the cause of all these troubles. I,
therefore, began to call myself Ramchandra Hari Marathe and told (the boys) to address me by that
name. About this time an England-returned reformer by name Kashinathpant Gadgil who had
contrary to the (Hindu) religion, allowed his daughter to remain unmarried till she reached the age of
sixteen years, gave her in marriage to the son of another reformer named Chintaman Narayan Bhat
and the marriage was celebrated with great pomp. We did not at all approve of this match. Both
Bhat and Gadgil are related to us, but as they are reformers and as they contravene the precepts of
the Dharma Sastras, they have incurred our bitter hostility. We had taken a vow to treat even our
father as our enemy if he infringed the Shastras.+++(5)+++ We were invited to dine and to a pan-supari (on the
occasion) by both the above persons, but I alone out of the
male members of our family attended the pan-supari. I did so, thinking that if I went there I would
have an opportunity of personally witnessing their irreligious conduct and thus of satisfying myself
about the matter. I did not attend their dinner party, as I looked down upon them as Dheds.</p>
<p>The day
of the varat procession at last arrived, when, thinking that it would be a disgrace if that procession
connected . with an irreligious marriage paraded through the city with eclan and without any hitch, in
the face of religious enthusiasts (like ourselves) we determined to obstruct it anyhow and sent word
round to all our companions that it was to be attacked that night. We conjectured that the procession
being a large one would pass through the main street, and therefore we inspected the road passing
by the market, and having stationed boys in the cross lanes supplied them with stones, with
instructions to fiercely attack the procession the moment it came within their respective bounds.
Having made these preparations we waited (for the procession), but were informed that instead of
passing the high road with great pomp it had taken a by-way. Thus our plan proved futile. Still, we
hastened to attack the procession, but the onset did not prove as effective as we had wished. We
desired to see at least one of the newly married couple (wounded and) taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>On
learning this, many will be struck with our hard-heartedness, but after a little consideration all
sensible persons will be obliged to admit that what we did was right. It is a rule laid down by the
Shastras that the following are the four methods of overcoming any person :—Conciliation,
presents, fomenting dissensions, and punishment. It is in accordance with that rule that my other
castemen have been fighting the reformers. The antagonistic parties are known as the Krishna and
the Shukla parties. As, however, the Shukla party, being powerless to punish their opponents, is
defied by them, we thought over the matter, and with a desire to take the power of chastisement into
our own hands, made this initial effort (in that direction). But this our first experiment did not prove
as successful as we had wished.</p>
<p>Only a few ladies were hit. I, however, record that incident here,
because these ladies must have a recollection of it. After this, we went to Bombay for Chaturmas.
When leaving for that place, we appointed one (of us) to be the chief of our club, and having
arranged that the members of the club should act under his lead and that he should treat them in
accordance with the rules laid down by us, we departed.</p>
<h2 id="we-severed-connection-with-the-club">WE SEVERED CONNECTION WITH THE CLUB</h2>
<p>While we were away they collected several arms, viz., three old muskets, six swords and
some sword-sticks, and showed them to us when we visited Poona for the Ganpati (festival). On
inquiry we came to know that these arms had been stolen by a boy named Ranade from his own
house and that Bhide had aided him in doing so. We commended him for this. Then we heard what
each member (of the club) had to say individually, and thus came to know the details of what had
taken place during (the preceding) two months. Many of them told me that Bhide was in the habit of
speaking ill of me behind my back in their presence. This thought then came into my mind : &quot; If one
acts in opposition to us even at this stage, there is no knowing what he might do when the club
becomes invested with special importance. It will not therefore be advantageous to continue further
such a culb as this. What shall we do next ? &quot;</p>
<p>We then called a meeting of the members of the club
and addressed them as follows:— &ldquo;All of you are aware that this man, Bhide, had maliciously
spoken ill of us in your presence for no fault of ours. We have, however, come to this conclusion
from this occurrence, that we are not fitted to do any good to our country and have, therefore given
up everything from to-day. Any other person who may &ldquo;desire to take up this business is welcome to
do so. We do not wish to have any of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying we severed our connection with the club. After this, many of the boys came to my house
and implored me with tears in their eyes not to break up the club. Bhide wept most of all. That
deceitful individual shed a profusion of tears, and having protested that he had not spoken, (ill of
me) implored me not to dissolve our club. We, however, refused to listen to him and left for Bombay.</p>
<p>After some days I learnt that most of the things (belonging to the club) were taken away by a boy
named Devdhar. He also took away the arms, but when he came to know that the Police having
received information about the matter were about to search his house, he threw them into my house
which he knew was close by, through a latticed opening, keeping with himself only a dagger and
some spears. In the meantime, the Police came to search his house. He was arrested and
prosecuted. This news was immediately conveyed to us by our friend, Dattatraya Bhuskute, in a
letter. I accordingly at once came to Poona by the night mail (train), and having disposed of the
arms with the help of Bhuskute immediately returned to Bombay.</p>
<p>Devdhar did not mention the name
of any member of the club. He was asked by many wiseacres to mention the name of Chapekar, but
he did not pay any heed to their advice. He was afterwards discharged by the Court because of his
tender age. So ended our club. We at first felt very sorry that it had come to an end but after
consideration we came to the conclusion that Gosavya Maruti had done all this for our good. For
had the club continued to exist, it would certainly have been difficult to ensure the secrecy of our
doings. Afterwards, we two brothers came to Poona with our father, and having thought over the
matter, made up our minds not to have any club, but to enlist the co-operation of Bhuskute alone in
what we wished to do, so that there may be no risk of the matter being divulged. Having come to
this conclusion, we took action accordingly. All the boys, with the exception of Bhuskute, we
stopped from visiting our house, and he too as a rule came at night.</p>

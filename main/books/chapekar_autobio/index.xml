      <description>MY OBJECT IN WRITING (MY) AUTOBIOGRAPHY My countrymen, for a long time I have been actuated by a desire to commit to writing, in the form of a treatise, my experiences, good and bad, of life, from the time of my birth. But whenever that thought occurred to me, it was accompanied by a consciousness that any incidents, to be embodied in a treatise, must be of a singularly marvellous or unprecedented character.</description>

      <description>ALL DUE TO POVERTY I have already said that the adoption by my father of the profession of Haridas commended itself to the approval only of my father and grandfather, but not of any other (member of our family). Hence of course it cannot be said that a man will satisfactorily do anything in which he feels no interest. Even during my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s lifetime, some of my uncles behaved in a self-willed manner.</description>

      <description>WE TOOK TO KIRTAN AS A PROFESSION Thus our company being composed only of the members of our family, who were zealous in promoting the common interest, was now much admired by the public. It is now about twelve years since we adopted the performance of kathas as our permanent profession. Each one of us has now become perfectly proficient in the art. Everywhere praises are showered on our musical performance and on the excellence of our father&amp;rsquo;s kirtan.</description>

      <description>AN ACCOUNT OF US, TWO BROTHERS &amp;quot; A Yogabhrashsta individual takes birth in the house of a holy and wealthy men. There he regains the discipline which his mind had undergone in a former existence.&amp;quot; In our youth, we two brothers travelled a great deal with our father with the object of performing kirtan. In the course of our travels, while we were proceeding by train to Rajpur, a town beyond Nagpur, we saw the mountainous region thickly covered with trees through which we had to pass.</description>

      <description>INCIDENT WITH A MISSIONARY It happened one day that while our men had assembled at the foot of the Parvati before our arrival there, they saw a native missionary accompanied by a friend passing by. One of them had a double-barrelled gun in his hand. Taking the men to be pervert, our boys began to jeer at him. But they, through fright, took no notice of the jeers and went their way.</description>

      <description>WE SHIFTED TO OTHER PLACES We then began to consider how to act next. Having thought over the matter, we made up our mind to select an open space within the city and to train our boys there. We, therefore, hired the open piece&#39; of ground belonging to Londhe for Rs. 2 per month, and having placed the image of Maruti therein prepared a wrestling ground in front of the image.</description>

      <description>CONGRESS AND SOCIAL REFORM CONTROVERSY Meanwhile (the time for holding) the National Congress arrived. As it was to be held at Poona that year, we were desirous of seeing personally what sort of a revolutionary movement it was. Before this, a fierce dispute was going on in the city between the orthodox and the reform parties with regard to the Social Conference. We do not approve of the National Congress, much less of the Social Conference.</description>

      <description>I MEET A MARATHA SUBEDAR I was well acquainted with Kashinath Baneh, the Subhedar Major of the 4th (Infantry) Regiment. At my first visit to him he asked me what I had come for. I said to him, &amp;ldquo;I am very fond of a military carrer. Can I be enrolled (in your regiment)&amp;rdquo;. Thereupon that man knit his brows, and giving an emphatic nasal twang to his voice said to me in the Konkani dialect, &amp;quot; Bhatji Bova, what you say is true, but how will you be able to observe the customs of your caste in the regiment ?</description>

      <description>THE SHIVAJI CELEBRATION Just at this time, the first occasion on which the anniversary of Shivaji&amp;rsquo;s birth was to be celebrated with festivities approached. My brother and myself do not at all like this festival. Such undertakings as involved a great deal of talk highly exasperated us. Besides, some features of the festival held in honour of Shivaji are so extravagant that he himself would not have liked them. In the first place, he would not at all have approved of the custom of celebrating the anniversary of his birth as it was tentamount to placing him on en equal footing with God.</description>

      <description>OUR HATRED OF THE ENGLISH In the meanwhile we again tried to get ourselves enlisted in a regiment, but failed. This was the last disappointment suffered by us and we strongly reviled the English as follows : &amp;quot; A system of administration so cruel as that of the English cannot, if search be made, be found, in any region of this globe. Far better were the tyrannical Yavan kings, who, with sword in hand, actually cut the throats of men as if they were so many goats.</description>

      <description>WE WRITE ANOTHER LETTER As they (the English) suspected that the Brahmins alone were responsible for this affair, we hit upon a device to transfer their suspicion to the Muhammadans by sending a letter (to the newspapers ?) purporting to be signed by a Ghazi. We thought it would be a good thing if the letter were written in Hindustani, but as there was no one amongst us who knew the language, we decided to send it in English, and just as we had made the editor of the Suryodaya to publish a letter in connection with a previous incident, viz.</description>

  <p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>We began by noting that the sword of Islam was blunted in India.  Islam
had spread in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Africa and even
parts of Europe with a bang.  Within a hundred years of the death of the
Prophet this spectacular success had been achieved through the
instrument of <em>Jihad</em>.  It appeared as if there was no stopping the
Islamic avalanche on the Globe, both to the east and the west of the
land of its birth - Arabia.  But contrary to all hopes and expectations,
Islam received a check in a most unexpected quarter - Hindustan, a
country believed to be divided by caste, tom by dissensions and
indifferent to conventionality in religious faith.  Persistent efforts
were made to Islamize India but to no avail.</p>
<p>At various points of time it was fervently hoped by Muslims that all the
Hindus would be converted to Islam.  The Arab invasion of Sind saw lot
of proselytization, but such conversions proved to be temporary.  “The
tide of Islam, having overflowed Sind and the lower Punjab, ebbed,
leaving (only) some jetsam on the strand.”^(<a href="#1">1</a>)  Three hundred
years later Mahmud of Ghazni’s exertions raised fresh hopes.  He
promised the Khalifa that he would convert the country through his
yearly expeditions.  He did his worst.  In the words of Alberuni,
“Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, by which the
Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions, and like a
tale of old in the mouth of the people.”^(<a href="#2">2</a>)  But no, the Hindus
did not become a tale of old.  They remained entrenched in their
country, so that when Timur invaded India at the end of the fourteenth
century, the inhabitants of India were found by him to be chiefly
“polytheists and infidels”.  “My principal object in the invasion of
Hindustan,” said he, “is to lead an expedition against the infidels
that, according to the law of Muhammad (upon whom and his family be the
blessings and peace of God), we may convert to the true faith the people
of that country, and purify the land itself from the filth of infidelity
and polytheism; and that we may overthrow their temples and idols and
become <em>ghaziz</em> and <em>mujahids</em> before God.”^(<a href="#3">3</a>)  He did his worst,
and again the Hindus regained their position in the course of time.
After one and a quarter century of this, when Babur invaded Hindustan,
he found that “Most of the inhabitants of Hindustan are pagans.  They
call a pagan a Hindu… All artisans, wage-earners and officials are
Hindu.”^(<a href="#4">4</a>)  As late as the end of the seventeenth century,
Francois Bernier also found Hindustan tea country containing hundreds of
Gentiles to one Mogol, or even to one <em>Mahometan</em>.”^(<a href="#5">5</a>)  Even when
Aurangzeb from within and Nadir Shah and Abdali from without, determined
to strike a final blow for Islamization of Indian population, they could
not decimate the Hindus.  In such a desperate situation Indian Muslims
could only wistfully remember the days of Subuktigin and Mahmud of
Ghazni.  Muhammad Aslam in his <em>Farhat-un-Nazirin</em> says that during the
Third Battle of Panipat (1761), “about ninety thousand persons, male and
female, were taken prisoners, and obtained the eternal happiness by
embracing the Muhammadan faith.  Indeed, never was such splendid victory
achieved from the time of Amir Mahmud Subuktigin”^(<a href="#6">6</a>) As discussed
earlier, the assertion is not correct,^(<a href="#7">7</a>) but as a Muslim
Muhammad Aslam did so will, so desire.</p>
<p>So, all through the medieval period, Foreign and Indian Muslims strove
hard to make India a Muslim country by converting and eliminating the
Hindus.  They killed and converted, and converted and killed by turns.
In the earlier centuries of their presence here, the picture was sombre
indeed.  Turkish rule was established in northern India at the beginning
of the thirteenth century.  Within fifteen years of Muhammad Ghori’s
occupation of Delhi, the Turks rapidly conquered most of the major
cities of northern India.  Their lightening success, as described by
contemporary chroniclers, entailed great loss of life.  Qutbuddin
Aibak’s conquests during the life-time of his master and later on in the
capacity of king (c.1200-1210) included Gwalior, parts of Bundelkhand,
Ajmer, Ranthambhor, Anhilwara, as well a parts of U.P. and Malwa.  In
Nahrwala alone 50,000 persons were killed during Aibak’s
campaign.^(<a href="#8">8</a>)  No wonder, he earned the nickname of killer of
lacs.^(<a href="#9">9</a>)   Bakhtiyar Khalji marched through Bihar into Bengal and
massacred people in both the regions.  During his expedition to Gwalior
Iltutmish (1210-36) massacred 700 persons besides those killed in the
battle on both sides.  His attacks on Malwa (Vidisha and Ujjain) were
met with stiff resistance and were accompanied by great loss of
life.  He is also credited with killing 12,000 Khokhars (Gakkhars)
during Aibak’s reign.^(<a href="#10">10</a>) The successors of Iltutmish (Raziyah,
Bahram, etc.) too fought and killed zealously.  During the reigns of
Nasiruddin and Balban (1246-86) warfare for consolidation and expansion
of Turkish dominions went on apace.  Trailokyavarman, who ruled over
Southern U.P., Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand, and is called “Dalaki va
Malaki” by Persian chroniclers, was defeated after great slaughter
(1248).  In 1251, Gwalior, Chanderi, Narwar and Malwa were attacked.
The Raja of Malwa alone had 5,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry and would
have been defeated only after great loss of life.  The inhabitants of
Kaithal were given such severe punishment (1254) that they ‘might not
forget (the lesson) for the rest of their lives.’ In 1256 Ulugh Khan
Balban carried on devastating warfare in Sirmur, and ‘so many of the
rebellious Hindus were killed that numbers cannot be computed or
described.’ Ranthambhor was attacked in 1259 and ‘many of its valiant
fighting men were sent to hell.’ In the punitive expedition to Mewat
(1260) ‘numberless Hindus perished under the merciless swords of the
soldiers of Islam.’ In the same year 12,000 men, women and children were
put to the sword in Hariyana.</p>
<p>As a minister Balban was not softhearted.  When he became the Sultan, he
followed the policy of blood and iron, which means that his killings
became even more sanguinary.  His sphere of operations was, however,
confined to the Ganga-Jamuna doab and Avadh, Katehar and Mewat.  In
Katehar large sections of the male population were massacred and,
according to Barani, in villages and jungles heaps of human corpses were
left rotting.  During his expedition to Bengal, ‘on either side of the
principal bazar (of Lakhnauti) in a street two miles in length, a row of
stakes was set up and the adherents of Tughril were impaled upon them.’</p>
<p>Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughlaq (c. 1296-1350) were great
warriors and killers.  Alauddin’s conquest of Gujarat (1 299) and the
massacres by his generals in Anhilwara, Cambay, Asavani, Vanmanthali
etc., earned him, according to the <em>Rasmala</em>, the nickname of
Khuni.  His contemporary chronicler proclaims that Alauddin shed more
blood than the Pharaohs did.^(<a href="#11">11</a>) He captured Ranthambhor after
very heavy casualties.^(<a href="#12">12</a>)  Chittor’s capture was followed by a
massacre of 30,000 people, after Jauhar had been performed and the
Rajputs had died fighting in large numbers.  When Malwa was attacked
(1305), its Raja is said to have possessed 40,000 horse and 100,000
foot.^(<a href="#13">13</a>)  After the battle, ‘so far as human eye could see, the
ground was muddy with blood.’ Many cities of Malwa like Mandu, Ujjain,
Dharanagari and Chanderi were captured after great resistance.  The
capitulation of Sevana and Jalor (1308-1311) were accompanied by
massacres after years of prolonged warfare.  In Alauddin’s wars in the
south, similar killings took place, especially in Dwarasamudra and
Malabar.  In the latter campaign Malik Kafur went from place to place,
and to some places many times over, and in his rage at not finding the
fleeing prince Vira Pandya, he killed the people
mercilessely.^(<a href="#14">14</a>) His successor Mubarak Khalji once again sacked
Gujarat and Devagiri.</p>
<p>Under Muhammad Tughlaq, wars and rebellions knew no end.  Even an
enhancement of land-tax ended in massacres in the Doab.  Many more
perished on the way when the capital was shifted to Daulatabad.  His
Qarachal expedition cost him a whole army.  His expeditions to Bengal,
Sind and the Deccan, as well as ruthless suppression of twenty-two
rebellions, meant only depopulation.^(<a href="#15">15</a>) From all accounts it is
certain that in the thirteenth and first half of the fourteenth century
the loss of population was immense.  For one thing, in spite of constant
efforts no addition of territory could be made by Turkish rulers from
1210 to 1296, for another while the weapons of the Turkish period were
not as sophisticated as those of the Mughal, the Turkish rulers were
more ruthless in war and less merciful towards rebels, with the result
their killings were heavy.  Hence the extirpating campaigns of Balban,
and the repeated attacks on regions already devastated but not
completely subjugated.  Bengal was attacked by Bakhtiyar, by Balban, by
Alauddin, and by all the three Tughlaqs - Ghayas, Muhammad and Firoz.
Malwa and Gujarat were repeatedly attacked and sacked.  Almost every
Muslim ruler invaded Ranthambhor until it was subjugated by Alauddin
Khalji (1301, again temporarily).  Gwalior, Katehar and Avadh regions
were also repeatedly attacked.  Rajputana, Sind and Punjab (also because
of the Mongol invasions), knew no peace.  In the first decade of the
fourteenth century Turkish invaders penetrated into the South, carrying
death and destruction.  When the sultans of Delhi lost their hold on the
South, Bahmani and Vijayanagar kingdoms came to grips with each other.
The wars between these two kingdoms generally ended in massacres.  Only
one instance should suffice to give an idea of this.  Mulla Daud of
Bidar vividly describes the fighting between Muhammad Shah Bahmani and
the Vijayanagar king in 1366 in which “Ferishtah computes the victims on
the Hindu side alone as numbering no less than half a
million.”^(<a href="#16">16</a>)  According to Ferishtah, Muhammad “So wasted the
districts of Carnatic that for several decades they did not recover
their natural population.”^(<a href="#17">17</a>)</p>
<p>Despite such killings, the Hindus could not be eliminated or reduced to
a minority.  Despite forcible conversions, India could not be
Islamised.  How did it happen?  Alberuni has solved this riddle.  “They
(the Hindus),” says he, “differ from us in religion… There is very
little disputing about theological topics among themselves; at the most
they fight with words, but they will never stake their soul or body or
their property on religious controversy.” On the contrary “in all
manners and usages they differ from us to such a degree as to frighten
their children with us… and as to declare us to be devil’s breed and our
doings as the very opposite of all that is good and proper,” so that
“they call all foreigners as <em>mleccha</em>, i.e. impure, and forbid having
any connection with them, be it by intermarriage or any other kind of
relationship, or by sitting, eating, and drinking with them, because
thereby they think, they would be polluted… They are not allowed to
receive anybody who does not belong to them, even if he wished it, or
was inclined to their religion.”^(<a href="#18">18</a>)  In brief, the Hindus
believed in peaceful discussions about religious matters.  They believed
in freedom of religious thought and higher spirituality.  They hated
those who killed in the name of religion and they shunned those who
believed in conversions.</p>
<p>That is how Hindu non-violence succeeded over forcible conversions; that
is how culturally the Hindu won against strong and aggressive
adversaries.  The proof of this lies in Mughal emperor Babur’s
testimony.  “Compared with our countries,” writes he when he had settled
in India, “(Hindustan) is a different world… once the water of Sind is
crossed, everything is ‘m the Hindustan way (<em>tariq</em>) - land, water,
tree, rock, people and horde, opinion and custom.”^(<a href="#19">19</a>) And to
repeat his words, “Most of the inhabitants of Hindustan are pagans; they
call a pagan a Hindu.”^(<a href="#20">20</a>) And this after centuries of Muslim
effort at changing the <em>dar-ul-harb</em> into <em>dar-ul-Islam</em>.!</p>
<p>The scenario has never changed to the extreme disappointment of the
Indian Muslims.  So that, more than anything else the endeavour of the
Indian Muslims is to increase their numbers.  The decadal census figures
from 1881 to 1941 show a constant rise in Muslim numbers.  This is a
feature common with medieval times, and the pattern of modern Muslim
demography can be seen in the following Table.</p>

<p>A study in some depth shows that the growth rate among the Hindus is the
lowest and among Muslims the highest^(<a href="#24">24</a>) as seen in the above
Table.</p>
<p>Thus even in modern times at no census have the Muslim numbers failed to
improve, or the Hindu failed to lose.  This phenomenon has been
attributed besides vigorous proselytization, to polygamy, remarriage of
widows, and higher fecundity among the Muslims.^(<a href="#25">25</a>)  Kingslay
Davis thinks it due to the Hindus having taken to western education and
secularism with alacrity as against the general backwardness of the
Muslims.^(<a href="#26">26</a>) The insistence of the Muslims on their Personal
law, their reluctance to Family Planning, their pacts of privileges with
political parties at the time of elections in particular and their
receiving millions of Petro-Dollars to help in proselytizing endeavours
all point to their desire and determination to grow in numbers and
Islamize Hindustan.  Their greatest chagrin is that in spite of their
best efforts for more than a thousand years, they have ever remained a
minority in India.  Therefore, just as they have reconciled themselves
to the peculiar circumstances of their conversion, if: they could also
learn to live as a minority with India’s tolerant Hindu majority, there
will be peace for them and for all.</p>

      <description>Indian Muslims
Prologue
There are books on Indian Muslims like M. Mujeeb’s The Indian Muslims (George Allen &amp;amp; Unwin, London, 1967) and Ram Gopal’s Indian Muslims (Asia Publishing House, Bombay, 1959). There are journals, Articles, and “Letters to the Editor” on Indian Muslims or Muslim Indians. But who are these Indian Muslims?
M. Mujeeb answers: “whoever they may be, and wherever they may be in India, the Indian Muslims take themselves for granted” (p.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1
Early Muslims
No integrated contemporary account exists to say how Islam spread in India. Medieval chroniclers very graphically describe the achievements of Muslim invaders, conquerors, monarchs, governors, rulers of independent Muslims kingdoms, and even officials, in effecting conversions. Muslim hagiological works, some reliable others not so reliable, too report on addition to Muslim population through conversions. But the actual numbers who embraced Islam year after year and decade after decade are not known.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2
Rise of Muslims under the Sultanate
Muslim population in India grew with the expansion of Turkish rule in Hindustan. Its rise was due mainly to the immigration of Muslims from abroad and conversion of Hindus to Islam. There were Muslim losses also, in wars, famines, and through reconversions, and there was the growth of Muslim numbers through natural procreation in years and decades. We study all these processes, to begin with between C.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
Proselytization in Provincial
Muslim Kingdoms
A year before the dawn of the fifteenth century, Timur had claimed to have invaded Hindustan to destroy its infidels and idolators.¹ In the year 1400 India was predominantly Hindu; Muslims comprised less than 2 per cent of the population. The country south of the Krishna River right up to Cape Camorin formed the Vijayanagar empire and it was Hindu. On the west coast, the strip between Goa in the south to Chaul and (future) Bombay in the north was in the hands of independent Hindu rulers.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4
Growth under the Mughals
By the time Akbar the Great (1556-1605) embarked upon the policy of reuniting these kingdom under his imperial banner, Muslim population was rising all over the country. Still, despite all the exertion of the Muslims at proselytization, Hindu resistance to it was also admirably effective. Sind and Punjab no doubt had a sizeable Muslim population. But at the beginning of the sixteenth century, northern Sind (north of the River Indus) had, according to Portuguese accounts, a local Hindu as its ruler or governor.</description>

      <description>Chapter 5
Factors Contributing to the Growth of Muslim Population
A study of the preceding pages clearly shows that the rise in Muslim population was due mainly to conversions of Hindus to Islam. It also needs no reiteration that “it was part of the state policy to establish Islam as the religion of the whole land”.^(1) It would again be a truism to say that “Islam is essentially a missionary religion” and every Muslim is a propagandist of his faith; and as they settled in India, they must have entered upon proselytizing efforts.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6
Factors which Checked Islamization of India
Now, if the components of growth of Muslim population were many, Muslim losses comparatively few, and fecundity among them high, the problem that needs investigation is why Muslims have remained a minority in this country and why India, unlike many other countries in the medieval period, could not be completely converted to Islam.
Vastness of the Country
The vastness of the country and its natural and political division into regions and kingdoms made the task of its complete subjugation and conversion extremely difficult.</description>

      <description>Epilogue
We began by noting that the sword of Islam was blunted in India. Islam had spread in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Africa and even parts of Europe with a bang. Within a hundred years of the death of the Prophet this spectacular success had been achieved through the instrument of Jihad. It appeared as if there was no stopping the Islamic avalanche on the Globe, both to the east and the west of the land of its birth - Arabia.</description>

      <description>*Selections from the Munir Report (1954)*
1) An Islamic State
a.) It has been repeatedly said before us that implicit in the demand for Pakistan was the demand for an Islamic State. Some speeches of important leaders who were striving for Pakistan undoubtedly lend themselves to this construction. These leaders while referring to an Islamic State or to a State governed by Islamic laws perhaps had in their minds the pattern of a legal structure based on or mixed up with Islamic dogma, personal law, ethics, and institutions.</description>

2) Foundations of an Islamic State
a.) What is then the Islamic State of which everybody talks but nobody thinks? Before we seek to discover an answer to this question, we must have a clear conception of the scope and function of the State.
b.) The ulama were divided in their opinions when they were asked to cite some precedent of an Islamic State in Muslim history.</description>

3) Essentials of an Islamic State
a.) Since the basis of Islamic law is the principle of inerrancy of revelation and of the Holy Prophet, the law to be found in the Qur&amp;rsquo;an and the sunna is above all man-made laws, and in case of confliot between the two, the latter, irrespective of its nature, must yield to the former. Thus, provided there be a.</description>

6) Legislature and Legislation
a.) Legislature in its present sense is unknown to the Islamic system. The religio-political system which is called din-i-Islam is a complete system which contains in itself the mechanism for discovering and applying law to any situation that may arise. During the Islamic Republic there was no legislature in its modern sense; and for every situation or emergency that arose, law could be discovered and applied by the ulama.</description>

7) The position of non-Muslims
a.) The ground on which the removal of Chaudhri Zafrullah Khan and other Ahmadis occupying key positions in the State is demanded is that the Ahmadis are non-Muslims; and that therefore, like zimmies in an Islamic State, they are not eligible for appointment to higher offices in the State. This aspect of the demand has directly raised a question about the position of non-Muslims in Pakistan if we are to have an Islamic Constitution.</description>

8) Apostasy
a.) Apostasy in an Islamic State is punishable with death. On this the ulama are practically unanimous (vide the evidence of Maulana Abul Hasanat Sayyad Muhammad Ahmad Qadri, President, Jami&amp;rsquo;at-ul-Ulama-i-Pakistan, Punjab; Maulana Ahmad Ali, Sadr Jami&amp;rsquo;at-ul-Ulama-i-lslam, West Pakistan; Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi, founder and ex-Amir-i-Jama&amp;rsquo;at-i-Islami, Pakistan; Mufti Muhammad Idris, Jami&amp;rsquo;Ashrafia, Lahore, and Member, Jami&amp;rsquo;at-ul. Ulama-i-Pakistan; Maulana Daud Ghaznavi, President, Jami&amp;rsquo;at-i-Ahl-i-Hadith, Maghribi Pakistan; Maulana Abdul Haleem Qasimi, Jami&amp;rsquo;at-ul-Ulama-i-Islam, Punjab; and Mr.</description>

10) Jihad
a.) Earlier we have pointed out that one of the doctrines on which the Musalmans and Ahmadis are at variance is that of jihad. This doctrine at once raises a host of other allied matters such as the meanings of ghazi, shahid, jihad.bis-sail, jihad fi sabili&amp;rsquo;llah, dar-ul-Islam, dar-ul-harb, hijrat, ghanima, khums, and slavery, and the conflict or reconciliation of these conceptions with modern international problems such as aggression, genocide, international criminal jurisdiction, international conventions, and rules of public international law.</description>

      <title>108 Reaction on Muslims of non-Muslim states</title>

11) Reaction on Muslims of non-Muslim states
a.) The ideology on which an Islamic State is desired to be founded in Pakistan must have certain consequences for the Musalmans who are living in countries under non-Muslim sovereigns. We asked Amir-i-Shari&amp;rsquo;at Sayyad Ataullah Shah Bukhari whether a Muslim could be a faithful subject of a non-Muslim State, and reproduce his answer: &amp;ndash;
 &amp;ldquo;Q.&amp;ndash; In your opinion is a Musalman bound to obey orders of a kafir Government?</description>

12) Other incidents
a.) Other incidents of an Islamic State are that all sculpture, playing of cards, portrait painting, photographing human beings, music, dancing, mixed acting, cinemas, and theatres will have to be closed. Thus says Maulana Abdul Haleem Qasimi, representative of Jami&amp;rsquo;at-ul-Ulama-i-Pakistan: &amp;ndash;
 &amp;ldquo;Q:&amp;ndash; What are your views on tashbih and tamseel?
A.&amp;ndash; You should ask me a concrete question.
Q.&amp;ndash;What are your views on lahw-o-la&amp;rsquo;b?</description>

13) Khwaja Nazim-ud-din&amp;rsquo;s reaction to the demands
a.) We have stated in earlier parts of the Report how the three demands in respect of the Ahmadis came to be formulated and presented to Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din under the threat of direct action. In view of the long and frequent discussions Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din had with the ulama, the correctness and justification of the demands on theological grounds must have been discussed.</description>

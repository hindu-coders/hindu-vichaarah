<p>2) Foundations of an Islamic State</p>
<p>a.) What is then the Islamic State of which everybody talks but
nobody thinks? Before we seek to discover an answer to this question, we
must have a clear conception of the scope and function of the State.</p>
<p>b.) The <em>ulama</em> were divided in their opinions when they were
asked to cite some precedent of an Islamic State in Muslim history.
Thus, though Hafiz Kifayat Husain, the Shia divine, held out as his
ideal the form of Government during the Holy Prophet&rsquo;s time, Maulana
Daud Ghaznavi aho included in his precedent the days of the Islamic
Republic, of Umar bin Abdul Aziz, Salah ud-Din Ayyubi of Damascus,
Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad Tughlaq and Aurangzeb, and the present
regime in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Most of them, however, relied on the form of Government during the
Islamic Republic from 632 to 661 A.D., a period of less than thirty
years, though some of them also added the very short period of Umar bin
Abdul Aziz. Maulana Abdul Haamid Badayuni stated that the details of the
ideal State would be worked out by the <em>ulama</em>, while Master Taj-ud-Din
Ansari&rsquo;s confused notion of an Islamic State may be gathered from the
following portion of his interrogation: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Were you also in the Khilafat movement?<br>
A.&ndash;Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; When did the Khilafat movement stop in India?<br>
A.&ndash; In 1923. This was after the Turks had declared their country to
be a secular State.<br>
Q.&ndash; If you are told that the Khilafat movement continued long after
the Turks had abolished Khilafat, will that be correct?<br>
A.&ndash; As far as I remember, the Khilafat movement finished with the
abolition of the Khilafat by the Turks.<br>
Q.&ndash; You are reported to have been a member of the Khilafat movement
right up to 1928 and having made speeches. Is it correct?<br>
A.&ndash; It could not be correct.<br>
Q.&ndash; Was the Congress interested in Khilafat?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; Was Khilafat with you a matter of religious conviction, or just a
political movement?<br>
A.&ndash; It was purely a religious movement.<br>
Q.&ndash; Did the Khilafat movement have the support of Mr. Gandhi!<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; What was the object of the Khilafat movement?<br>
A.&ndash; The Britisher was injuring the Khilafat institution in Turkey,
and the Musalman was aggrieved by this attitude of the Britisher.<br>
Q.&ndash; Was not the object of the movement to resuscitate the Khilafat
among the Musalmans?<br>
A.&ndash; No.<br>
Q.&ndash; Is Khilafat with you a necessary part of a Muslim form of
Government?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; Are you, therefore, in favour of having a Khilafat in Pakistan?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; Can there be more than one Khalifa of the Muslims?<br>
A.&ndash; No.<br>
Q.&ndash; Will the Khalifa of Pakistan be the Khalifa of all the Muslims of
the world?<br>
A.&ndash; He should be but cannot be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>c.) Throughout the three thousand years over which political
thought extends, and such thought in its early stages cannot be
separated from religion, two questions have invariably presented
themselves for consideration:­-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) what are the precise functions of the State? and<br>
(2) who shall control the State?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the true scope of the activities of the State is the welfare,
temporal or spiritual or both, of the individual, then the first
question directly gives rise to the bigger question: What is the object
of human life and the ultimate destiny of man? On this, widely divergent
views have prevailed, not at different times but at one and tbe same
time.</p>
<p>The pygmies of equatorial West Africa still believe that their God Komba
has sent them into the forest to hunt and dance and sing. The Epicureans
meant very much the same when they said that the object of human life is
to drink and eat and be merry, for death denies such pleasures. The
utilitarians base their institutions on the assumption that the object
of human life is to experience pleasant sensations of mind and body,
irrespective of what is to come hereafter. The Stoics believed in
curbing and reducing all physical desires, and Diogenes found a tub good
enough to live in. German philosophers think that the individual lives
for the State, and that therefore the object of life is service of the
State in all that it might decide to undertake and achieve. Ancient
Hindu philosophers believed in the logic of the fist, with its natural
consequence, the law of natural selection and the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>The Semitic theory of State, whether Jewish, Christian or Islamic, has
always held that the object of human life is to prepare ourselves for
the next life and that, therefore, prayer and good works are the only
object of life. Greek philosophers, beginning with Socrates, thought
that the object of human life was to engage in philosophical meditation
with a view to discovering the great truths that lie in nature, and that
the business of the others is to feed the philosophers engaged in that
undertaking.</p>
<p>Islam emphasises the doctrine that life in this world is not the only
life given to man but that eternal life begins after the present
existence comes to an end, and that the status of a human being in the
next world will depend upon his beliefs and actions in this world. As
the present life is not an end in itself but merely a means to an end,
not only the individual but also the State &ndash; as opposed to the secular
theory which bases all political and economic institutions on a
disregard of their consequences on the next life &ndash; should strive for
human conduct which ensures for a person better status in the next
world.</p>
<p>According to this theory Islam is the religion which seeks to attain
that object. Therefore the question immediately arises: What is Islam,
and who is a <em>momin</em> or a Muslim? We put this question to the <em>ulama</em>,
and we shall presently refer to their answers to this question. But we
cannot refrain from saying here that it was a matter of infinite regret
to us that the <em>ulama</em>, whose first duty should be to have settled views
on this subject, were hopelessly disagreed among themselves.</p>
<p>Apart from how these learned divines have expressed themselves, we
conceive of Islam as a system that covers, as every systematic religion
must, the following five topics:&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the dogma; namely, the essentials of belief;<br>
(2) the cult; namely, religious rites and observances which a person
must perform;<br>
(3) ethics; i.e., rules of moral conduct;<br>
(4) institutions, social, economic, and political; and<br>
(5) law proper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essential basis of the rules on all these subjects is revelation and
not reason, though both may coincide. This coincidence, however, is
accidental, because human reasoning may be faulty and ultimate reason is
known only to God, Who sends His message to humanity through His chosen
messengers for the direction and guidance of the people. One must,
therefore, accept the dogma, observe the cult, follow the ethics, obey
the law, and establish institutions which God has revealed, though their
reason may not be apparent &ndash; nay, even if they be opposed to human
reason.</p>
<p>Since an error by God is an impossibility, anything that God has
revealed, whether its subject be something occult or preternatural,
history, finance, law, worship, or something which according to human
thought admits of scientific treatment &ndash; as for instance, [the] birth
of man, evolution, cosmology, or astronomy &ndash; has got to be accepted as
absolute truth. The test of reason is not the acid test, and a denial of
this amounts to a denial of the supreme wisdom and designs of Allah &ndash;
it is <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p>d.) Now God has revealed Himself from time to time to His
favoured people, of whom our Holy Prophet was the last. That revelation
is contained in the Qur&rsquo;an, and covers the five topics mentioned above.
The true business of a person who believes in Islam is therefore to
understand, believe in, and act upon that revelation.</p>
<p>e.) The people whom God chooses as medium for the transmission
of His messages are <em>rasuls</em> (messengers) or <em>nabis</em> (prophets). Since
every action or saying of a prophet is, [as] in the case of our own
Holy Prophet it certainly was, prompted by Allah, it has the same degree
of inerrancy as the formal revelation itself, because prophets are
<em>ma&rsquo;sum</em>, incapable of doing or saying something which is opposed to
Divine wishes. These sayings and actions are <em>sunna</em> having the same
infallibility as the Qur&rsquo;an. The record of this <em>sunna</em> is <em>hadith</em>,
which is to be found in several books which were compiled by Muslim
scholars after long, laborious, and careful research extending over
several generations.</p>
<p>f.) The word <em>hadith</em> means a record of actions or sayings of
the Prophet and his companions. At first the <em>sahaba</em>, i.e. people who
had lived in the society of the Prophet, were the best authority for a
knowledge of the <em>sunna</em>. Later people had to be content with the
communications of the <em>tabi&rsquo;un</em>, i.e. successors, people of the first
generation after the Holy Prophet who had received their information
from the <em>sahaba</em>, and then in the following generations with the
accounts of the so-called successors of the successors
(<em>tabi&rsquo;ul-tabi&rsquo;un</em>), i.e. people of the second generation after the Holy
Prophet, who had consorted with the successors.</p>
<p><em>Marfu&rsquo;</em> is a tradition which contains a statement about the Prophet;
<em>mawquf</em>, a tradition that refers only to the sayings or doings of the
<em>sahaba</em>; and <em>maqtu&rsquo;</em>, a tradition which does not at most go further
back than the first generation after the Holy Prophet and deals only
with sayings or doings of <em>tabi&rsquo;un</em>. In some of the <em>ahadith</em> the actual
word of God is to be found. Any such tradition is designated
<em>Hadith-i-Qudsi</em> or <em>Ilahi</em> as distinguished from an ordinary
<em>Hadith-i-Nabvi</em>.</p>
<p>g.) A very large portion of sayings ascribed to the Prophet deal
with the <em>ahkam</em> (legal professions), religious obligations, <em>halal</em> and
<em>haram</em> (what is allowed and forbidden), with ritual purity, laws
regarding food, and criminal and civil law. Further they deal with
dogma, retribution at the Last Judgment, hell and paradise, angels,
creation, revelations, the earlier prophets. Many traditions also
contain edifying sayings and moral teachings by the Holy Prophet.</p>
<p>h.) The importance of <em>ahadith</em> was realised from the very
beginning, and they were not only committed to memory but in some cases
were reduced to writing. The work of compilation of <em>hadith</em> began in
the third century after the Hijra, and the Sihah Sitta were all compiled
in that century. These are the <em>musannifs</em> of &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Al-Bukhari, died 256/870,<br>
(2) Muslim, died 261/875,<br>
(3) Abu Dawud, died 275/888,<br>
(4) Al-Tirmizi, died 279/892,<br>
(5) Al-Nasa&rsquo;i, died 303/915, and<br>
(6) Ibn-i-Maja, died 273/886.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i.) According to modern laws of evidence, including our own, the
<em>ahadith</em> are inadmissible evidence of <em>sunna</em> because each of them
contains several links of hearsay, but as authority on law they are
admissible <em>pro prio vigore</em>. The merit of these collections lies not so
much in the fact that (as is often wrongly stated) their authors decided
for the first time which of the numerous traditions in circulation were
genuine and which false, but rather in the fact that they brought
together everything that was recognised as genuine in orthodox circles
in those days.</p>
<p>j.) The Shias judge <em>hadith</em> from their own standpoint, and only
consider such traditions reliable as are based on the authority of Ali
and his adherents. They have, therefore, their own works on the subject
,and hold the following five works in particularly high esteem &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Al-Kafi of Muhammad b. Yaqub AI-Kulini, died 328/939,<br>
(2) Man La Yastahdiruhu&rsquo;l-Fakih of Muhammad b. Ali b. Babuya Al-Kummi,
died 381/991,<br>
(3) Tahdib Al-Ahkam,<br>
(4) Al-Istibsar Fi-Ma&rsquo;khtalafa Fihi&rsquo;l-Akhbar (extract from the
preceding) of Muhammad Altusi, died 459/1067, and<br>
(5) Nahj Al-Balagha (alleged sayings of Ali) of Ali b. Tahir Al-Sharif
Al-Murtaza, died 436/1044 (or of his brother Radi Al­Din Al-Baghdadi).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>k.) After the ritual, the dogma, and the most important
political and social institutions had taken definite shape in the second
and third centuries, there arose a certain <em>communis opinio</em> regarding
the reliability of most transmitters of tradition and the value of their
statement. The main principles of doctrine had already been estahlished
in the writmgs of Malik b. Anas, Al-Shafi&rsquo;i, and other scholars regarded
as authoritative in different circles, and mainly on the authority of
traditional sayings of the Holy Prophet. In the long run no one dared to
doubt the truth of these traditions, and this almost conclusive
presumption of truth has since continued to be attached to the <em>ahadith</em>
compiled in the Sihah Sitta.</p>
<p>l.) We have so far arrived at this result: that any rule on any
subject that may be derived from the Qur&rsquo;an or the <em>sunna</em> of the Holy
Prophet. is binding on every Musalman. But since the only evidence of
<em>sunna</em> is the <em>hadith</em>, the words <em>sunna</em> and <em>hadith</em> have become
mixed up with, and indistinguishable from, each other; with the result
that the expression &ldquo;Qur&rsquo;an and <em>hadith</em>&rdquo; is not infrequently employed
where the intention is to refer Qur&rsquo;an and <em>sunna</em>.</p>
<p>m.) At this stage another principle, equally basic, comes into
operation, and that is that Islam is the final religion revealed by God,
complete and exhaustive in all respects, and that God will not abrogate,
detract from, or add to this religion (<em>din</em>) any more than He will send
a fresh messenger. The <em>din</em> having been perfected (<em>Akmalto lakum
dinokum</em>, Sura V, verse 3), there remains no need for any new code
repealing, modifying, or amplifying the original code; nor for any fresh
messenger or message. In this sense, therefore, prophethood ceased with
the Holy Prophet, and revelation stopped forever. This is the doctrine
of the cessation of <em>wahi-i-nubuwwat</em>.</p>
<p>n.) If the proposition that Muslim dogma, ethics, and
institutions, etc., are all based on the doctrine of inerrancy, whether
such inerrancy lies in the Qur&rsquo;an, the <em>sunna</em>, <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> or
<em>ijtihad-i-mutlaq</em>, is fully comprehended, the various deductions that
follow from it will be easily understandable. As the ultimate test of
truth, whether the matter be one of a ritual or political or social or
economic nature, is revelation; and revelation has to be gathered from
the Qur&rsquo;an,<br>
and the <em>sunna</em> carries almost the same degree of inerrancy as
revelation, and the only evidence of <em>sunna</em> is <em>hadith</em>, the first duty
of those who desire to establish an Islamic State will be to discover
the precise rule applicable to the existing circumstances, whether that
rule is to be found in the Qur&rsquo;an or <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously the persons most suited for the purpose would be those who
have. made the Qur&rsquo;an and <em>hadith</em> their life-long study, namely, among
the Sunnies, the <em>ulama</em>, and among the Shias, the <em>mujtahids</em> who are
the spokesmen of the hidden Imam, the ruler <em>de jure divino</em>. The
function of these divines would be to engage themselves in discovering
rules applicable to particular situations, and they will be engaged in a
task similar to that in which Greek philosophers were engaged, with only
this difference: that whereas the latter thought that all truth lay in
nature, which had merely to be discovered by individual effort, the
<em>ulama</em> and the <em>mujtahids</em> will have to get at the truth that lies in
the holy Book and the books of <em>hadith</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>ulama</em> Board which was recommenrleli by the Basic Principles
Committee was a logical recognition of this principle, and the true
objection against that Board should indeed have been that the Board was
too inadequate a mechanism to implement the principle which had brought
that body into existence. .</p>
<p>o.)<em>Ijma&rsquo;</em> means concurrence of the <em>mujtahids</em> of the people,
i.e., of those who have a right, in virtue of knowledge, to form a
judgment of their own, after the death of the Holy Prophet. The
authority of <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> rests on the principle of a divine protection
against error, and is founded on a basal tradition of the Holy Prophet,
&ldquo;My people will never agree in error,&rdquo; reported by Ibn Maja. By this
procedure points which had been in dispute were fixed; and when fixed,
they became an essential part of the faith, and disbelief in them an act
of unbelief (<em>kufr</em>). The essential point to remember abont <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> is
that it represents the agreement of the <em>mujtahids</em>, and that the
agreement of the masses is espedally excluded. Thus <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> has not only
fixed unsettled points, but has changed [illegible word] doctrines of
the greatest importance.</p>
<p>p.) The distinction between <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> and <em>ijtihad</em> is that
whereas the former is collective, the latter is individual. <em>Ijtihad</em>
means the exerting of one&rsquo;s self to the utmost degree to form an opinion
in a case, or as to a rule of law. This is done by applying analogy to
the Qur&rsquo;an and the <em>sunna</em>. <em>Ijtihad</em> did not originally involve
inerrancy, its result being always <em>zann</em> or fallible opinion. Only
combined <em>ijtihad</em> led to <em>ijma&rsquo;</em>, and was inerrant.</p>
<p>But this broad <em>ijtihad</em> soon passed into special <em>ijtihad</em> of those who
had a peculiar right to form judgments. When later doctors looked back
to the founding of the four legal schools, they assigned to their
founders an <em>ijtihad</em> of the first rank (<em>ijtihad-i­mutlaq</em>). But from
time to time individuals appeared who returned to the earliest meaning
of <em>ijtihad</em> and claimed for themselves the right to form their own
opinion from first principles.</p>
<p>One of these was the Hanbalite Ibn Taimiya (died 728). Another was
Suyuti (died 911), in whom the claim to <em>ijtihad</em> unites with one to be
the <em>mujaddid</em> or renewer of religion in his century. At every time
there must exist at least one <em>rnujtahid</em>, was his contention, just as
in every century there must come a <em>mujaddid</em>. In Shia Islam there are
still absolute <em>mujtahids</em>, because they are regarded as the spokesmen
of the hidden Imam. Thus collective <em>ijtihad</em> leads to <em>ijma&rsquo;</em>, and the
basis of <em>ijma&rsquo;</em> is divine protection against error &ndash; inerrancy.</p>

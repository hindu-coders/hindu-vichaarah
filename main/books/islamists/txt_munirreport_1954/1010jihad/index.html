<p>10) Jihad</p>
<p>a.) Earlier we have pointed out that one of the doctrines on
which the Musalmans and Ahmadis are at variance is that of <em>jihad</em>. This
doctrine at once raises a host of other allied matters such as the
meanings of <em>ghazi</em>, <em>shahid</em>, <em>jihad.bis-sail</em>, <em>jihad fi sabili&rsquo;llah</em>,
<em>dar-ul-Islam</em>, <em>dar-ul-harb</em>, <em>hijrat</em>, <em>ghanima</em>, <em>khums</em>, and
slavery, and the conflict or reconciliation of these conceptions with
modern international problems such as aggression, genocide,
international criminal jurisdiction, international conventions, and
rules of public international law.</p>
<p>b.) An Islamic State is <em>dar-ul-Islam</em>, namely, a country where
the ordinances of Islam are established and which is under the rule of a
Muslim sovereign. Its inhabitants are Muslims and also non-Muslims who
have submitted to Muslim control and who, under certain restrictions and
without the possibility of full citizenship, are guaranteed their lives
and property by the Muslim State. They must, however, be people of
Scriptures and may not be idolaters. An Islamic State is in theory
perpetually at war with the neighbouring non-Muslim country, which at
any time may become <em>dar-ul-harb</em>, in which case it is the duty of the
Muslims of that country to leave it and to come over to the country of
their brethren in faith.</p>
<p>We put this aspect to Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi, and reproduce his
views: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Is a country on the border of <em>dar-ul-Islam</em> always <em>qua</em> an
Islamic State in the position of <em>dar-ul-harb</em>?<br>
A.&ndash; No. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the Islamic
State will be potentially at war with the non-Muslim neighbouring
country. The non-Muslim oountry acquires the status of <em>dar-ul-harb</em>
only after the Islamic State declares a formal war against it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Ghias-ul-Lughat, <em>dar-ul-harb</em> is a country belonging to
infidels which has not been subdued by Islam, and the consequences of a
country becoming <em>dar-ul-harb</em> are thus stated in the Shorter
Encyclopedia of Islam: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When a country does become a <em>dar-ul-harb</em>, it iz the duty of all
Muslims to withdraw from it, and a wife who refuses to accompany her
husband in this, is ipso facto divorced.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus in case of a war between India and Pakistan, if the latter is an
Islamic State, we must be prepared to receive forty million Muslims from
across the border into Pakistan. In fact, Maulana Abdul Haamid Badayuni,
President, Jami&rsquo;at-ul-Ulama-i-Pakistan, thinks that a case for <em>hijrat</em>
already exists for the Musalmans of India. The following is his view on
this subject: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Do you call your migration to Pakistan as <em>hijrat</em> in the
religious sense?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>c.) We shall presently point out why :Mirza Ghulam Ahmad&rsquo;s
version of the doctrine of <em>jihad</em> is relied on as a ground for his and
his community&rsquo;s <em>kufr</em>, but before we do that it is necessary first to
state how <em>jihad</em> has been or is understood by the Musalmans. There are
various theories about <em>jihad</em>, which vary from the crude notion of a
megalomaniac moved by religious frenzy going out armed with a sword and
indiscriminately slaughtering non-Muslims in the belief that if he dies
in the combat he becomes a <em>shahid</em> and if he succeeds in killing
attains the status of a <em>ghazi</em>, to the conception that a Musalman
throughout his life is pitted against <em>kufr</em>, <em>kufr</em> here being used in
the sense of evil and wrong, and that his principal activity in life is
to strive by argument and where necessary by force to spread Islam until
it becomes a world religion. In the latter case he fights not for any
personal end, but because he considers such strife as a duty and an
obligation which he owes to Allah, and the only recompense for which is
the pleasure of Allah.</p>
<p>The Shorter Encyclopredia of Islam contains the following brief article
on <em>djihad</em>: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;DJIHAD (A), holy war. The spread of Islam by arms is a religious duty
upon Muslims in general. It narrowly escaped being a sixth <em>rukn</em>, or
fundamental duty, and is indeed still so regarded by the descendants
of the Kharidjis. This position was reached gradually but quickly. In
the Meccan Suras of the Quran, patience under attack is taught; no
other attitude was possible. But at Medina the right to repel attack
appears, and gradually it became a prescribed duty to fight against
and subdue the hostile Meccans.</p>
<p>Whether Muhammad himself recognised that his position implied steady
and unprovoked war against the unbelieving world until it was subdued
to Islam may be in doubt. Traditions are explicit on the point; but
the Qur&rsquo;anic passages speak always of the unbelievers who are to be
subdued as dangerous or faithless. Still, the story of his writing to
the powers around him shows that such a universal position was
implicit in his mind, and it certainly developed immediately after his
death, when the Muslim armies advanced out of Arabia. It is now a
<em>fard ala&rsquo;l-kifaya</em>, a duty in general on all male, free, adult
Muslims, sane in mind and body and having means enough to reach the
Muslim army, yet not a duty necessarily incumbent on every individual,
but sufficiently performed when done by a certain number.</p>
<p>So it must continue to be done until the whole world is under the rule
of Islam. It must be controlled or headed by a Muslim sovereign or
<em>imam</em>. As the <em>imam</em> of the Shias is now invisible, they cannot have
a <em>djihad</em> until he reappears. Further, the requirement will be met if
such a sovereign makes an expedition once a year, or, even, in the
later view, if he makes annual preparation for one. The people against
whom the <em>djihad</em> is directed must first be invited to embrace Islam.
On refusal they have another choice. They may submit to Muslim rule,
become <em>dhimmis</em> (q. v.) and pay <em>djizya</em> and <em>kharadj</em> (q. v.), or
fight. In the first case, their lives, families and property are
assured to them, but they have a definitely inferior status, with no
technical citizenship, and a standing only as protected wards. If they
fight, they and their families may be enslaved, and all their property
seized as booty, four­fifths of which goes to the conquering army.</p>
<p>If they embrace Islam, and it is open to them to do so even when the
armies are face to face, they become part of the Muslim community with
all its rights and duties. Apostates must be put to death. But if a
Muslim country is invaded by unbelievers, the <em>imam</em> may issue a
general summons calling all Muslims there to arms, and as the danger
grows so may be the width of the summons, until the whole Muslim world
is involved. A Muslim who dies fighting in the path of Allah (<em>fi sabi
Allah</em>) is a martyr (<em>shahid</em>) and is assured of Paradise and of
peculiar privileges there.</p>
<p>Such a death was, in the early generations, regarded as the peculiar
crown of a pious life. It is still, on occasions, a strong incitement,
but when Islam ceased to conquer it lost its supreme value. Even yet,
however, any war between Muslims and non­Muslims must be a <em>djihad</em>
with its incitements and rewards. Of course, such modern movements as
the so-called Mu&rsquo;tazili in India and the Young Turk in Turkey reject
this, and endeavour to explain away its basis; but the Muslim masses
still follow the unanimous voice of the canon lawyers.. Islam must be
completely made over before the doctrine of <em>djihad</em> can be
eliminated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>d.) The generally accepted view is that the fifth verse to
Sura-i-Tauba (Sura IX) abrogated the earlier verses revealed in Mecca
which permitted the killing of <em>kuffar</em> only in self-defence. As against
this, the Ahmadis believe that no verse in the Qur an was abrogated by
another verse, and that both sets of verses, namely, the Meccan verses
and the relative verses in Sura-i-Tauba, have different scopes and can
stand together. This introduces the difficult controversy of <em>nasikh</em>
and <em>mansukh</em>, with all its implications.</p>
<p>It is argued on behalf of the Ahmadis that the doctrine of <em>nasikh</em> and
<em>mansukh</em> is opposed to the belief in the existence of an original
Scripture in Heaven, and that implicit in this doctrine is the admission
that unless the verse alleged to be repealed was meant for a specific
occasion and by the coming of that occasion fulfilled its purpose and
thus spent itself, God did not know of the subsequent circumstances
which would make the earlier verse inapplicable or lead to an undesired
result.</p>
<p>The third result of this doctrine, it is pointed out, cuts at the very
root of the claim that laws of Islam are immutable and inflexible,
because if changed circumstances made a new revelation necessary, any
change in the circumstances subsequent to the completion of the
revelation would make most of the revelation otiose or obsolete.</p>
<p>We are wholly incompetent to pronounce on the merits of this
controversy, but what has to be pointed out is the result to which the
doctrine of <em>jihad</em> will lead if, as appears from the article in the
Shorter Encyclopredia of Islam and other writings produced before us,
including one by Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi and another by Maulana
Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, it involves the spread of Islam by arms and
conquest. &lsquo;Aggression&rsquo; and &lsquo;genocide&rsquo; are now offences against humanity
for which, under sentences pronounced by different International
tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokio, the war lords of Germany and Japan had
to forfeit their lives; and there is hardly any difference between the
offences of aggression and genocide on the one hand, and the doctrine of
spread of Islam by arms and conquest on the other.</p>
<p>An International Convention on genocide is about to be concluded[ but
if the view of <em>jihad</em> presented to us is correct, Pakistan cannot be a
party to it. And while the following verses in the Mecca Suras: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sura II, verses 190 and 193:</p>
<p>190. &ldquo;Fight in the Cause of God<br>
Those who fight you,<br>
But do not transgress limits;<br>
For God loveth not transgressors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>193. &ldquo;And fight them on<br>
Until there is no more<br>
Tumult or oppression,<br>
And there prevail<br>
Justice and faith in God;<br>
But if they cease,<br>
Let there be no hostility<br>
Except to those<br>
Who practise oppression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sura XXII, verses 39 and 40:</p>
<p>39. &ldquo;To those against whom<br>
War is made, permission<br>
Is given (to fight) because<br>
They are wronged;&ndash; and verily,<br>
God is most Powerful<br>
For their aid;-&rdquo;</p>
<p>40. &ldquo;(They are) those who have<br>
Been expelled from their homes<br>
In defiance of right,­-<br>
(For no cause) except<br>
That they say, &lsquo;Our Lord<br>
Is God.&rsquo; Did not God<br>
Check one set of people<br>
By means of another,<br>
There would surely have been<br>
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br>
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br>
The name of God is commemorated<br>
In abundant measure. God will<br>
Certainly aid those who<br>
Aid His (cause);&ndash;for verily<br>
God is Full of Strength,<br>
Exalted in Might,<br>
(Able to enforce His Will),&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>contain in them the sublime principle which international jurists have
only faintly begun to discover, we must go on preaching that aggression
is the ehief characterestic of Islam.</p>
<p>e.) The law relating to prisoners of war is another branch of
Islamic law which is bound to come in conflict with International Law.
As for instance, in matters relating to the treatment of prisoners of
war, we shall have to be governed by Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi&rsquo;s view,
assuming that view is based on the Qur&rsquo;an and the <em>sunna</em>, which is as
follows: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Is there a law of war in Islam?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; Does it differ fundamentally from the modern International Law of
war?<br>
A.&ndash; These two systems are based on a fundamental difference.<br>
Q.&ndash; What rights have non-Muslims who are taken prisoners of war in a
<em>jihad</em>? &quot;<br>
A .&ndash; The Islamic law on the point is that if the country of which
these prisoners are nationals pays ransom, they will be released. An
exchange of prisoners is also permitted. If neither of these
alternatives is possible, the prisoners will be converted into slaves
forever. If any such person makes an ofler to pay his ransom out of
his own earnings, he will be permitted to collect the money necessary
for the <em>fidya</em> (ransom).<br>
Q.&ndash; Are you of the view that unless a Government assumes the form of
an Islamic Government, any war declared by it is not a <em>jihad</em>?<br>
A.&ndash; No. A war may be declared to be a <em>jihad</em> if it is declared by a
national Government of Muslims in the legitimate interests of the
State. I never expressed the opinion attributed to me in Exhibit D. E.
12: &ndash; [the Urdu text given in transliteration is omitted here]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The question remains whether, even if the Government of Pakistan,
in its present form and structure, terminates her treaties with the
Indian Union and declares war against her, this war would fall under
the definition of <em>jihad</em>. The opinion expressed by him in this
behalf is quite correct. Until such time as the Government becomes
Islamic by adopting the Islamic form of Government, to call any of
its wars a <em>jihad</em> would be tantamount to describing the enlistment
and fighting of a non-Muslim on the side of the Azad Kashmir forces
<em>jihad</em>, and his death martyrdom. What the Maulana means is that in
the presence of treaties, it is against Shari&rsquo;at if the Government
or its people participate in such a war. If the Government
terminates the treaties and declares war, even then the war started
by Government would not be termed <em>jihad</em> unless the Government
becomes Islamic&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>About the view expressed in this letter being that of Maulana Abul Ala
Maudoodi, there is the evidence of Mian Tufail Muhammad, the writer of
the letter, who states: &ldquo;Exhibit D. E. 12 is a photostat copy of a
letter which I wrote to someone whose name I do not now remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maulana Abul Hasanat Muhammad Ahmad Qadri&rsquo;s view on this point is as
follows:­</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Is there a law of war in Islam?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; Does it differ in fundamentals from the present International
Law?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; What are the rights of a person taken prisoner in war?<br>
A.&ndash; He can embrace Islam or ask for <em>aman</em>, in which case he will be
treated as a <em>musta&rsquo;min</em>. If he does not ask for <em>aman</em>, he would be
made a slave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>f.) Similar is the opinion expressed by Mian Tufail Muhammad
of&rsquo;Jama&rsquo;at-i-Islami who says: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Q.&ndash; Is there any law of war in Islamic laws?<br>
A.&ndash; Yes.<br>
Q.&ndash; If that comes into conflict with Intemational Law, which will you
follow?<br>
A.&ndash; Islamic law.<br>
Q.&ndash; Then please state what will be the status of prisoners of war
captured by your forces.<br>
A .&ndash;I cannot reply to this off hand. I will have to study the point.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course <em>ghanima</em> (plunder) and <em>klums</em> (one-fifth) if treated as a
necessary incident of <em>jihad</em>, will be treated by international society
as a mere act of brigandage.</p>

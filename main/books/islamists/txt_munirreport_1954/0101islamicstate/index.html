<p>1) An Islamic State</p>
<p>a.) It has been repeatedly said before us that implicit in the
demand for Pakistan was the demand for an Islamic State. Some speeches
of important leaders who were striving for Pakistan undoubtedly lend
themselves to this construction. These leaders while referring to an
Islamic State or to a State governed by Islamic laws perhaps had in
their minds the pattern of a legal structure based on or mixed up with
Islamic dogma, personal law, ethics, and institutions. No one who has
given serious thought to the introduction of a religious State in
Pakistan has failed to notice the tremendous difficulties with which any
such scheme must be confronted.</p>
<p>Even Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, who must be considered to be the first thinker
who conceived of the possibility of a consolidated North Western Indian
Muslim State, in the course of his presidential address to the Muslim
League in 1930 said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nor should the Hindus fear that the creation of autonomous Muslim
States will mean the introduction of a kind of religious rule in such
States. The principle that each group is entitled to free development
on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow
communalism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we come to deal with the question of responsibility we shall have
the occasion to point out that the most important of the parties who are
now clamouring for the enforcement of the three [anti-Ahmadi] demands
on religious grounds were all against the idea of an Islamic State. Even
Maulana Abul Ala. Maudoodi of Jama&rsquo;at-i-Islami was of the view that the
form of Government in the new Muslim State, if it ever came into
existence, could only be secular.</p>
<p>b.) Before the Partition, the first public picture of Pakistan
that the Quaid-i-Azam gave to the world was in the course of an
interview in New Delhi with Mr. Doon Campbell, Reuter&rsquo;s Correspondent.
The Quaid-i-Azam said that the new State would be a modern democratic
State, with sovereignty resting in the people, and the members of the
new nation having equal rights of citizenship regardless of their
religion, caste or creed. When Pakistan formally appeared on the map,
the Quaid-i-Azam in his memorable speech of 11th August 1947 to the
Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, while stating the principle on which
the new State was to be founded, said: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, in this division it was impossible to avoid the
question of minorities being in one Dominion or the other. Now that
was unavoidable. There is no other solution. Now what shall we do?
Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and
prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being
of the people, and especially of the masses and the poor. If you will
work in co-operation, forgetting the past, burying the hatchet, you
are bound to succeed. If you change your past and work together in a
spirit that every one of you, no matter to what community he belongs,
no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what
is his colour, caste, or creed, is first, second, and last a citizen
of this State with equal rights, privileges, and obligations, there
will be no end to the progress you will make.</p>
<p>I cannot emphasize it too much. We should begin to work in that
spirit, and in course of time all these angularities of the majority
and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim community
&ndash; because even as regards Muslims you have Pathans, Punjabis, Shias,
Sunnis and so on, and among the Hindus you have Brahmins, Vashnavas,
Khatris, also Bengalees, Madrasis and so on &ndash; will vanish. Indeed if
you ask me, this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of India to
attain the freedom and independence, and but for this we would have
been free people long long ago. No power can hold another nation, and
specially a nation of 400 million souls, in subjection; nobody could
have conquered you, and even if it had happened, nobody could have
continued its hold on you for any length of time, but for this.
Therefore, we must learn a lesson from this. You are free; you are
free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to
any other place or worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong
to any religion or caste or creed &ndash; that has nothing to do with the
business of the State. (<em>Hear, hear!</em>) As you know, history shows that
in England conditions, some time ago, were much worse than those
prevailing in India today. The Roman Catholics and the Protestants
persecuted each other. Even now there are some States in existence
where there are discriminations made and bars imposed against a
particular class. Thank God, we are not starting in those days. We are
starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction
between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste
or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle:
that we are all citizens, and equal citizens, of one State. (<em>Loud
applause.</em>) The people of England in [the] course of time had to
face the realities of the situation, and had to discharge the
responsibilities and burdens placed upon them by the government of
their country; and they went through that fire step by step. Today,
you might say with justice that Roman Catholics and Protestants do not
exist; what exists now is that every man is a citizen, an equal
citizen of Great Britain, and they are all members of the Nation.</p>
<p>Now I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal, and you
will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus, and
Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because
that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political
sense as citizens of the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Quaid-i-Azam was the founder of Pakistan. and the occasion on which
he thus spoke was the first landmark in the history of Pakistan. The
speech was intended both for his own people. including non-Muslims. and
the world&rsquo; and its object was to define as clearly as possible the ideal
to the attainment of which the new State was to devote all its
energies. There are repeated references in this speech to the bitterness
of the past, and an appeal to forget and [to] change the past and to
bury the hatchet. The future subject of the State is to be a citizen
with equal rights, privileges, and obligations, irrespective of colour,
caste, creed, or community. The word &lsquo;nation&rsquo; is used more than once,
and religion is stated to have nothing to do with the business of the
State and to be merely a matter of personal faith for the individual.</p>
<p>c.) We asked the <em>ulama</em> whether this conception of a State was
acceptable to them, and every one of them replied in an unhesitating
negative, including the Ahrar, and erstwhile Congressites with whom
before the Partition this conception was almost a part of their faith.
If Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi&rsquo;s evidence correctly represents the view of
Jama&rsquo;at-i-Islami, a State based on this idea is the creature of the
devil, and he is confirmed in this by several writings of his chief,
Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi, the founder of the Jama&rsquo;at. None of the
<em>ulama</em> can tolerate a State which is based on nationalism and all that
it implies; with them <em>millat</em> and all that it connotes can alone be the
determining factor in State activity.</p>
<p>d.) The Quaid-i-Azam&rsquo;s conception of a modern national State, it
is alleged,became obsolete with the passing of the Objectives Resolution
on 12th March 1949; but it has been freely admitted that this
Resolution, though grandiloquent in words, phrases, and clauses, is
nothing but a hoax, and that not only does it not contain even a
semblance of the embryo of an Islamic State but its provisions,
particularly those relating to fundamental rights, are directly opposed
to the principles of an Islamic State.</p>

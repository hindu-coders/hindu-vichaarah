<p>13) Khwaja Nazim-ud-din&rsquo;s reaction to the demands</p>
<p>a.) We have stated in earlier parts of the Report how the three
demands in respect of the Ahmadis came to be formulated and presented to
Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din under the threat of direct action. In view of the
long and frequent discussions Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din had with the <em>ulama</em>,
the correctness and justification of the demands on theological grounds
must have been discussed. Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din is a devoutly religious
man, and since he did not straight away reject the demands, he must have
been impressed by their plausibility.</p>
<p>At the same time, he must have realised that the demands were merely a
thin end of the wedge, and that if the principle that such religious
matters were to be discussed and determined by the State were conceded,
he might be confronted with some more awkward demands. He must also have
thought of the possible repercussions of the acceptance of demands not
only on the Islamic world, but also on the international world. The
essential assumption underlying the demands was that in an Islamic State
there is a fundamental difference between the rights of the Muslims and
non­Muslims, and that in such a State it is one of the ordinary duties
of the State to decide whether a community or an individual is or is not
Muslim.</p>
<p>The demand relating to the removal of Chaudhri Zafrullah Khan and the
other Ahmadis who occupied public posts of importance in the State,
presented a still more complicated problem. Chaudhri Zafrullah Khan was
widely known and respected in the international world. His removal was
bound to be widely publicised and to lead to international comment, and
an explanation which would have satisfied the international conscience,
would have been difficult to discover.</p>
<p>Under the Constitution Act, neither Chaudhri Zafrullah Khan nor any of
the Ahmadis occupying a public position could be removed from his office
on the ground of his religious belief ;and the Constituent Assembly of
Pakistan had, as early as 6th October, 1950, adopted an interim report
on fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan, by which every duly
qualified citizen was declared to be eligible to appointment in the
service of the State, irrespective of religion, race, caste, sex,
descent, or place of birth; and every citizen&rsquo;s right to freedom of
conscience and to profess, practise, and propagate religion was
guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Draft International Covenant on Human Rights, prepared by a
Commission on Human Rights appointed by the General Assembly of the
United Nations Organisation, of which Pakistan is a member, had provided
by Article 13 that every person shall have the right to freedom of
thought, conscience, and religion. including the freedom to change one&rsquo;s
religon or belief, and to manifest such religion or belief in teaching,
practice, worship, and observance.</p>
<p>The acceptance of the demands would, therefore, have created a flutter
in international dovecots, and the attention of the international world
would have been drawn in one way or another to what was happening in
Pakistan, because the acceptance of the demands would have amounted to a
public commitment that Pakistan was basing its citizenship on grounds
basically different from those observed by other nations, and that
non-Muslims were debarred from holding public offices in Pakistan merely
for their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>India never misses an opportunity to revile and .ridicule Pakistan, and
she would not have let this opportunity go unavailed. She also has a
communal problem, and would certainly have charged Pakistan of [=with]
going back on the agreement which was concluded between the Government
of India and the Government of Pakistan on 8th April, 1950, according to
which members of the minorities were guaranteed by both States equal
opportunity with members of the majority community to participate in the
public life of their country, to hold political or other offices, and to
serve in their countries&rsquo; civil and armed forces &ndash; rights which that
agreement recognised to be fundamental.</p>
<p>While concluding that agreement, the Prime Minister of Pakistan had
pointed to the Objectives Resolution adopted by the Constituent Assembly
of Pakistan as guaranteeing to the minorities the right to hold public
posts and offices in civil and armed forces, but now this very
Objectives Resolution was being used by the <em>ulama</em> as an irrefutable
argument in support of their claim that the distinction between the
Muslim and non-Muslim subjects of an Islamic State was, according to the
injunctions of the Qur&rsquo;an and <em>sunna</em>, fundamental; and that neither
according to the Qur&rsquo;an nor according to the <em>sunna</em> the Ahmadis, who
were alleged to be non-Muslims, could be permitted to hold any important
post.</p>
<p>India was not interested in the Ahmadi religion or the Ahmadis; nor with
[=in] such religious squabbles, of which she had steered clear. But
she must have immediately realised the implications of the acceptance of
the demands, and rightly contended that if Ahmadis could not be
permitted to hold public offices in the State, <em>a fortiori</em> the Hindu
community, in which India was interested, could not.</p>
<p>These implications must obviously have been present to the mind of
Khwaja Nazim ud-Din, and he must have felt a troublesome conflict
between his own religious convictions, and the implications resulting
from the acceptance of the demands. He, therefore, protracted his
negotiations with the <em>ulama</em>, hoping against hope that they would
abandon the demands, or that some unexpected event would solve the
issue, or human ingenuity discover some solution of the problem. He
hardly expected that the <em>ulama</em>, who had had long conversations with
him and his colleagues on this theological topic, would revolt against
his Government and start what was nothing short of a rebellion.</p>
<p>b.) Eventually Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din rejected the demands, and
gave reasons for the rejection. Simultaneously he ordered the <em>ulama</em> to
be arrested. The arrests led to the demonstrations, processions, public
meetings, and disorders<br>
which we have described in full in Part III of the Report. Sayyad
Firdaus Shah, D.S.P., was murdered on the evening of 4th March in or
just outside the Wazir Khan Mosque, where Maulana Abdus Sattar Khan
Niazi had virtually made himself the sole director of the agitation. On
5th March incidents of loot, arson, and murders began to be reported and
the police had to do a lot of shooting.</p>
<p>The military could do nothing, the arrangement with it being that it was
there in aid of the civil power, and was merely to accompany the police
and not to do anything independently unless a particular situation was
handed over to it. Despite repeated firing, the situation not only
showed no signs of improvement, but it went on deteriorating. In the
meeting of citizens at the Government House on the afternoon of 5th
March no leader, politician, or citizen was willing to incur the risk of
becoming unpopular or marked by signing an appeal to the good sense of
the citizen. The Kotwali was beleaguered by riotous mobs, and the
decisions taken in a meeting of Ministers and officers on the evening of
5th March were taken by the police as a direction to stop all firing.</p>
<p>The Kotwali therefore remained beseiged by riotous mobs, and the
machinery of Government showed signs of a total collapse on the morning
of 6th March, when the Government publicly announced its surrender to
anarchy. The Chief Minister&rsquo;s statement of that morning was intended to
be a piece of mere Machiavellianism, but the trick had hardly been tried
when the situation went completely out of control and the citizen
realised the imminence of the danger to his life and property. The
military could wait no longer, and took over.</p>
<p>To sum up. The circumstances that led to the proclamation of Martial Law
were: &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) The complete breakdown of administrative machinery and total
collapse of civil power, resulting in the Punjab Government&rsquo;s
statement of 6th March that it accepted the demands.</p>
<p>(2) The magnitude and intensity of the disorder, which led to this
breakdown.</p>
<p>(3) The magnitude and intensity of the disorder was directly
attributable to the circumstance that Government had lost all respect,
and that a religious complexion had been given to the demands, and
widespread belief sedulously inculcated in the masses that Ahmadis
were detracting from the status of the Holy Prophet and impairing a
basic doctrine in Islam.</p>
<p>(4) That nobody realised the implications of the demands, and if
anyone did so, he was not, out of fear of unpopularity or loss of
political support, willing to explain these implications to the
public.</p>
<p>(5) That the demands were presented in such a plausible form that in
view of the emphasis that had come to be laid on anything that could
even be remotely related to Islam or an Islamic State, nobody dared
oppose them, not even the Central Government which, for the several
months during which the agitation had, with all its implications, been
manifesting itself, did not make even a single public pronouncement on
the subject.</p>

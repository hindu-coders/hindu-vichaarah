Golden Age Hallucinations
Indian civilisation derives from no utopian ideal; it was founded on, and as, a crossroads

EXCERPTS: Preaching love and tolerance
By Ali S. Asani
Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, who lies buried in Ajmer, was one of the most revered sufis of India. Ali S. Asani
writes about him and his admirers.
Who was Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti and why has his dargah attained such pre-eminence? Although Muinuddin Chishti looms large in the history of Islam and Sufism in South Asia, we have, unfortunately, very little accurate information about him, because of an absence of reliable contemporary sources.</description>

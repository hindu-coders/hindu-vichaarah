title: Polycentrism
---

Polycentrism is one way the harmony among the deva-s manifests itself.

## Definition
- Polycentrism: "Many worshipers may worship a single God and regard the other Gods in the field as somehow dependent upon or aspects of their chosen deity." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
  - At a population level, that there is a "multiplicity of positive existential commitments" regarding the supreme deity is an empirical fact beyond dispute.
- In its strongest ideal never-realized form, _any_ deity (not just a limited set) can be considered as "center".

- Polycentrism can even exist \*within\* a deity due to it residing in multiple shrines - one may find the universe in one's clan deity (an individuation of the more abstract deva residing in a particular shrine) \[[KV](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/polycentrism-the-clan-deity-case/)\] .
    - "It's really a very important observation, because it shows that polycentricity is a primary feature of polytheism, from the ground up, so to speak, and not the result of the development of some kind of sophisticated, elite theology. Hence the paradigm case of polycentricity is the universal adequacy of a localized deity, not the universality of a nationwide cult." \[[EB](https://twitter.com/EPButler/status/942142795699105792)\]

- Examples:
    - Egyptian Isis cult - [SP17](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/620209859540062208/photo/1)

### Polycentrism with full mutual metaphysical acceptance
Different people may be centered on different such Gods (oft from a limited set), with mutual acceptance of such centerings showing the following traits:
- It is of the "my mother is the best mother in the world" kind.
- From a metaphysical perspective, there is no doubt that other centers than one's own can fully play the role of adoration "center".

Examples:
  - "iShTa-devatA" (as a stepping stone towards attributeless, formless, unfathomable brahman) concept among advaita-smArta hindu-s

### Polycentrism without full mutual metaphysical acceptance
- Example: the vaiShNava-s, shaiva-s etc.. can easily accord polycentrism (in the overall hindu population) hermeneutical significance (ie - one can reasonable imagine x,y or z is supreme based on texts). But full metaphyiscal agreement (where it concerns the nature of supreme God) would imply watering down their own philosophies.

## Polycentric social field
Definition: Mutual acknowledgement of certain multiple Gods (whatever the center) and intimate entanglement between their lores and cults defines a polycentric social field.

- Examples:
    - Acknowledgement of multiple deities who can each be treated as the center is clear in the vedic lore. \[[MT](http://indiafacts.org/polycentrism-many-one-problem-roots-yoga/#.VF0zlBFGjUZ)\]
    - "Of a dramatist-philosopher-logician from 10th century, jayanta bhaTTa whose work serves as a prototype for the religion/counter-religion distinction and also alludes to the 'tacit recognition' we speak of..."
    - "nAvalar, a devout and orthodox shaiva teacher from shrI lanka who had to contend with western missionaries attacking shaivam. In a certain polemical treatise, he raises a question often asked by the Padres  "Why do you attack only us when there are others within your own religion who believe in gods other than shiva (viSNu, etc) as supreme?" nAvalar proceeds to answer along the lines that these deities are recognized by his own deity & therefore worshiping them is no fault while the "god" of the padres is not recognized; again, alluding to the 'tacit recognition' idea."

## Squaring with conflicting claims to supremeness.
- If subrahmaNya is subordinate to shiva or indra or if durgA is created by other deities, it is because he/ she consents to it. So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.
- Further, the basic essence of other Gods is present in every God - there is just a difference in emphasis.
- Ideas such as moha-shAstra etc..

## Distinction from monotheism
- "These are not "pocket monotheisms" because they tacitly or explicitly presuppose that other Gods, who exist for them in a dependent status, can be and are experienced by others as at the center." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- " the degree of intimate entanglement that we see between diverse sects in a common polytheistic field, even where they display strong "single-pointedness", goes far beyond that of a congery of "wannabe monotheisms"." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]

## Acknowledgement by monotheist researchers:
- "In the Veda, however, the gods worshipped as supreme by each sect stand still side by side. No one is first always, no one is last always. Even gods of a decidedly inferior and limited character assume occasionally in the eyes of a devoted poet a supreme place above all other gods. It was necessary, therefore, for the purpose of accurate reasoning to have a name, different from polytheism, to signify this worship of single gods, each occupying for a time a supreme position, and I proposed for it the name of Kaihenotheism, that is a worship of one god after another, or of Henotheism, the worship of single gods." \[[MM](https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQIAAAAQAAJ&dq=kulluka%20bhatta%20garga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=henotheism&f=false)\]
- "Grimm showed that Thorr is sometimes the supreme god, while at other times he is the son of Odinn. This, as Professor Zimmer truly remarks, need not be regarded as the result of a revolution, or even of gradual decay, as in the case of Dyaus and Tyr, but simply as inherent in the character of a nascent polytheism. ... ' Among not yet civilised races prayers are addressed to a god with a special object, and to that god who is supposed to be most powerful in a special domain. He becomes for the moment the highest god to whom all others must give place. He may be invoked as the highest and the only god, without any slight being intended for the other gods.' " \[[MM](https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQIAAAAQAAJ&dq=kulluka%20bhatta%20garga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=henotheism&f=false)\]

### Risk in terms of understanding and classification
- "A key reason that polytheisms will never be regarded by some as "proper" religions is because the full potential of a polytheistic field need not be present for any given individual worshiper (who may have a specific supreme deity as his focus)." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- "The monotheists and closeted monotheists will then argue that there is no such recognition (of polycentrism) and what one calls polytheism is simply an assemblage of "wannabe monotheisms"."  \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- "this is the erasure of polytheisms as religions, that they are conceived as mere material assemblages that necessarily disintegrate under analysis. This means that only credal faiths can count as "religions"." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]

## Importance of the polycentric discourse:
- "Where the polycentric polytheistic field is explicitly articulated as such, we have the perfection of a philosophical discourse about religion, but this perfection is not a condition for the existence of polytheism as such, or for its essential polycentricity." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- "It is just that our thinkers & leaders are yet to fully grapple with this depth of discourse. Many of them would not be able to formulate a decent explanation of why this tacit recognition is more pronounced than one would give credit for & is indeed adequate." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]

## Polytheism vs Monotheism: Definitions
### Broader definition: Reducibility to unity
- Polytheism is: "Any theological account in which the divine is not reducible to unity, but rather intrinsically plural."

#### Examination
- "Would the concept of the Trinity be an example of Divinity being intrinsically and irreducibly plural? Christians claim it is not (three persons, one substance)." 

#### Position of henotheism
- Per this definition, monotheism can be thought to encompass henotheism where one reveres a single god as the only one in a given hymn and the others are at that time ignored.
- "Polytheism can be understood in terms of all Gods being inherent in *each* God, rather than all Gods being inherent in *one* God. Some authors use the term "polycentric polytheism" to refer to this understanding." - Edward Butler

### Stronger definition: aloneness in the God class
- Here exactly one God can claim "God" status. There may be other divinities -but they may not be called "God".
- "Nowadays, very many Hindus will tell you that in essence, Hinduism is a monotheism. These Hindus are not even aware of the proper meaning of this word. Monotheism does not mean that you worship one God (already requiring a serious reinterpretation of the many Gods effectively worshipped by most Hindus, from the Vedic rishis on down), the way some Hindus choose one God to worship from among many, a phenomenon that scholars of religion call henotheism. Nor is it the inclusive oneness of a divine essence underlying all the gods, or monism, as enunciated in the profoundest Vedic verses. It means an exclusive worship of a jealous God banishing all others. Mono- does not mean “one”, as Hindus seem to think; it means “alone”, hence “not tolerating another”. It does not say: “Allah and Shiva are one”, it says: “Only Allah is true, burn Shiva.” So far, there is no such jealous God in Dharma." \[Koenraad Elst [here](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2015/02/down-with-decolonization.html)\].

## Is Hinduism a polytheism?
- This question is meaningful once one accepts Hinduism as a religion (see [religion page](../../../../hinduism/religion/)).
- "The term "polytheism" does no conceptual violence to Hinduism, as monotheism clearly does. ... I was just struck by the emptiness of the claim, particularly given the tight etymological kinship between देव and θεός (- poly-devism -> poly-theism)." - EB

## Is vaiShNavism monotheist?
Vaishnavism is clearly not monotheist in the strong sense. Clear significant points of deviation are:

- \* viShNu can appear in avatAra-s a multitude of whom are adored.
- \* viShNu has a consort, a vehicle and innumerable servants and devotees who are also adored as being in the "God" class (though not as being in the "supreme God" class).
- \* Even shiva, shakti, skanda etc.. are considered limited aspects of viShNu, and as such their adoration is not considered evil - merely inferior from one's own perspective. They are not characterized as "false gods" (in the sense of the semitic cancers). This is non-exclusivism.  

## Is siddhAnta-shaivism monotheist?
Obviously not monotheist in the "strong sense". Not monotheist in the weak sense either! There are lots of beings who become "Shivas" equal in potency to the "primary active Shiva". More in the "[hierarchy/shaiva-siddhAnta-view](../hierarchy/shaiva-siddhAnta-view/)" page.

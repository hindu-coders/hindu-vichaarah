      <description>Foreword
The Reawakening of Dharmic and Native Traditions
There are two major groups of religions in the world today. First are the conversion-based religions of Christianity and Islam. Each holds that it is the only true faith for humanity and solely represents God&amp;rsquo;s plan and God&amp;rsquo;s will. Both reflect an exclusivist ethos of One God, a single holy book, a final prophet or single savior, an historical revelation, salvation from sin, and heaven or hell as the ultimate resting-place for the soul.</description>

      <description>PREFACE
Secularism per se is a doctrine which arose in the modem West as a revolt against the dosed creed of Christianity. Its battle-cry was that the State should be freed from the stranglehold of the Church, and the citizen should be left to his own individual choice in matters of belief. And it met with great success in every Western democracy.
Had India borrowed this doctrine from the modem West, it would have meant a rejection of the dosed creeds of Islam and Christianity, and a promotion of the Sanatana Dharma family of faiths which have been naturally secularist in the modern Western sense.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 1 - Something Seriously Wrong Somewhere It was the summer of 1959. I was working as secretary of an organisation of which the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan was the president. One day an RSS leader walked into my office. I had known him for a number of years. After some small talk, he suggested that I should request J.P. to visit an RSS camp which was being held in New Delhi at that time.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
PRESUPPOSITIONS OF JIZYAH
The Muslim psyche is of a peculiar making, vis-a-vis its attitude towards non-Muslims. According to the Prophet, every child is born in Islam, but its parents make it a non-Muslim.1 The Qur&amp;rsquo;ân declares the Muslims to be the best community and raised up to guide and govern humanity2 as viceregents of God on earth,3 and Islam to be the chosen religion4 destined to triumph over all other religions.</description>

      <description>FOREWORD BY PHILIP SPRATT
Why is there so much puzzlement about the politics of Jawaharlal Nehru? As Goel reminds us, and every newspaper reader can recall, he himself frequently says that he agrees in principle with the Communists. Why is he not taken at his word?
We do not take him at his word, because he says and does many other things, and so we do not realise how closely the relevant parts of his policy accord with this particular avowal.</description>

      <description>FROM ARYA SAMAJ TO MAHATMA GANDHI (I promised this intellectual autobiography to Hashmat, some twenty years ago. Hashmat wrote frequently in the Organiser under the general heading &amp;ldquo;Pakistan X-Rayed&amp;rdquo;. It is years since I lost track of him. But I never forgot my promise. I wonder what I would have written twenty years ago. I wonder also how this story will shape if I wait for another twenty years. And I do not know what its worth is today.</description>

      <description>FROM THE COVER OF &amp;ldquo;NEGATIONISM IN INDIA - CONCEALING THE RECORD OF ISLAM&amp;rdquo; Negationism usually means the denial of the Nazi genocide of the Jews and Gypsies in World War 2. Less well-known is that India has its own brand of negationism. A section of the Indian intelligentsia is still trying to erase from the Hindus&#39; memory the history of their persecution by the swordsmen of Islam. The number of victims of this persecution surpasses that of the Nazi crimes.</description>

      <description>Editors&#39; Note
 This book presents Sri Aurobindo&amp;rsquo;s vision of India as it grew from his return from England in 1893 to his political days in the first decade of the century and finally to his forty-year-long withdrawal from public view during which he plunged into his “real work” of evolutionary action.
This brief chronological selection from all that Sri Aurobindo said or wrote on India, her soul and her destiny, is by no means integral, but we trust it offers a sufficiently wide view of the lines of development Sri Aurobindo wished India to follow if she was to overcome the deep-rooted obstacles standing in the way of her rebirth.</description>

      <description>Introduction  Many people inside or close to the BJP, and inside or close to  the broader Sangh Parivar, have become dissatisfied with what they perceive as the increasing distance between the BJP&amp;rsquo;s actual policies and the Hindu expectations among the public on which the party capitalizes. To some extent, the problem lies with the BJP itself, distinguishing it from other Hindutva organizations, who then tend to blame the increasing non-Sangh element inside the BJP for this &amp;ldquo;degeneration&amp;rdquo;, especially the opportunists who jumped onto the promising BJP bandwagon after the 1989 and 1991 electoral breakthroughs.</description>

      <description>Preface
My first article, &amp;ldquo;The Spirit of Muslim Government in India&amp;rdquo;, was published in the Annual Bulletin of the Nagpur University Historical Society, No. 2, October 1947. It was revised and published under the title Muslim State in India by Vichar Prakashan, Allahabad, in 1950 in the form of a small book. Chapters on Muslim administration and government are also included in my History of the Khaljis (1950), Twilight of the Sultanate (1963), Studies in Medieval Indian History (1966), Early Muslims in India (1984), and The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India (1992).</description>

      <description>Preface
It was early in 1987 that Hinduism Today1 sent to me reprints of four articles that had been published in its issue of November/ December, 1986.2 Based on extensive research, the articles told the story of some Catholic missionaries establishing &amp;ldquo;ashrams&amp;rdquo; in different parts of India and doing many other things in order to look like Hindu sannyasins. They also pointed out some glaring contradictions between Hindu spiritual perceptions on the one hand and the basic Christian beliefs on the other.</description>

      <description>Preface
The concept of Secularism as known to the modern West is dreaded, derided and denounced in the strongest terms by the foundational doctrines of Christianity and Islam. Both of these doctrines prescribe Theocracy under which the State serves as the secular arm of the Church or the Ummah, and society is regimented by the Sacred Canon or the Shariat.
This fact is more than evident if we survey the history of Christianity till the French Revolution, and the practice which prevails in all Islamic states till today.</description>

      <description>The Demographic Siege
BY KEONRAAD ELST
1. Visions of a demographic doomsday
1.1. Hindus, the dying race
 Demography can change the cultural orientation of a country or  region by making an originally small group numerically dominant. Thus, demographic success was a decisive factor in the Christian take-over of the Roman Empire: in the first three centuries, Christian numbers grew by 40% per year, due to conversion and to the rejection of birth control (whether primitive contraception, abortion or infanticide).</description>

I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions; and I thank you in the name of millions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects.</description>

      <description>WHY WE DISAGREE 15th September, 1893
I will tell you a little story. You have heard the eloquent speaker who has just finished say, &amp;ldquo;Let us cease from abusing each other,&amp;rdquo; and he was very sorry that there should be always so much variance.
But I think I should tell you a story which would illustrate the cause of this variance. A frog lived in a well. It had lived there for a long time.</description>

      <description>PAPER ON HINDUISM Read at the Parliament on 19th September, 1893
Three religions now stand in the world which have come down to us from time prehistoric — Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Judaism. They have all received tremendous shocks and all of them prove by their survival their internal strength. But while Judaism failed to absorb Christianity and was driven out of its place of birth by its all-conquering daughter, and a handful of Parsees is all that remains to tell the tale of their grand religion, sect after sect arose in India and seemed to shake the religion of the Vedas to its very foundations, but like the waters of the seashore in a tremendous earthquake it receded only for a while, only to return in an all-absorbing flood, a thousand times more vigorous, and when the tumult of the rush was over, these sects were all sucked in, absorbed, and assimilated into the immense body of the mother faith.</description>

      <description>RELIGION NOT THE CRYING NEED OF INDIA 20th September, 1893
Christians must always be ready for good criticism, and I hardly think that you will mind if I make a little criticism. You Christians, who are so fond of sending out missionaries to save the soul of the heathen — why do you not try to save their bodies from starvation? In India, during the terrible famines, thousands died from hunger, yet you Christians did nothing.</description>

The World&amp;rsquo;s Parliament of Religions has become an accomplished fact, and the merciful Father has helped those who laboured to bring it into existence, and crowned with success their most unselfish labour.
My thanks to those noble souls whose large hearts and love of truth first dreamed this wonderful dream and then realised it. My thanks to the shower of liberal sentiments that has overflowed this platform.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
KARMA IN ITS EFFECT ON CHARACTER The word Karma is derived from the Sanskrit Kri, to do; all action is Karma. Technically, this word also means the effects of actions. In connection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects, of which our past actions were the causes. But in Karma-Yoga we have simply to do with the word Karma as meaning work. The goal of mankind is knowledge. That is the one ideal placed before us by Eastern philosophy.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
EACH IS GREAT IN HIS OWN PLACE According to the Sānkhya philosophy, nature is composed of three forces called, in Sanskrit, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. These as manifested in the physical world are what we may call equilibrium, activity, and inertness. Tamas is typified as darkness or inactivity; Rajas is activity, expressed as attraction or repulsion; and Sattva is the equilibrium of the two.
In every man there are these three forces.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
THE SECRET OF WORK Helping others physically, by removing their physical needs, is indeed great, but the help is great according as the need is greater and according as the help is far reaching. If a man&amp;rsquo;s wants can be removed for an hour, it is helping him indeed; if his wants can be removed for a year, it will be more help to him; but if his wants can be removed for ever, it is surely the greatest help that can be given him.</description>

      <description>1. AYODHYA
Ayodhya marks my political awakening. It is there that for the first time I came in contact with this strange phenomenon of Indian politics (which repeats itself all over the world): that what appears true, may often turn out to be false or is at best a half-truth; and that which seems false, or politically not correct, often turns out to be a truth. Journalism has to be a first-hand experience; that is, the correspondent should be able to judge what he has been asked to report – not through the prism of his atavism, set ideas and prejudices which he brings with him - but thanks to an inner intuition towards which he has constantly to aspire.</description>

THE SWORD OF TIPU SULTAN
Making darkness by closing one&amp;rsquo;s eyes
V.M. KORATH
Former Editor of Mathrubhoomi
Historical novels are usually an admixture of historical facts and imagination. As such they are not expected to truthfully portray all the historical events. However, authors of historical novels have the moral responsibility to present historical facts without blatant distortions.
Mr. Bhagwan Gidwani, the author of the controversial novel, The Sword of Tipu Sultan, does not seem to be bound by any such ethical obligations; he does not have any qualms even to deliberately falsify historical facts.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1
Sanatana Dharma: Anusmriti and Anudhyâyana
Repeated and Cherished Recollection
and Meditation on Sanatana Dharma
1. I take refuge in the great Sanatana dharma, the mother of many religions.
Spiritual Teachings: Âtma and Anâtma
2. The ancient sages studied man and for that they started with themselves; they turned their gaze inward and found there a vast internal life. Going still deeper, they discovered, beyond their more external being, another life or principle which takes another language to describe it; they found it self-existent, bodiless, pure, luminous and conscious; they found that it is in some way unborn and undying; that it does not come along with the body nor does it die with it; that it is beyond sorrow and decay; that it shines from within and it knows itself as self-evident.</description>

      <description>FIRST PREFACE
The eighteen chapters of this book appeared originally as eighteen installments of a series written by &amp;lsquo;Ekaki&amp;rsquo; in the weekly Organiser, New Delhi, from June 5 to October 9, 1961. The nineteenth chapter, Choosing Between USA And USSR, was contributed by me to the Diwali 1962 issue of the Organiser which came out soon after the first wave of Chinese invasion on October 20, 1962. They have been reprinted with a few minor changes here and there.</description>

The Situation at Present
In an earlier series, Hindu Society under Siege, I had dealt with the forces which threaten Hindu society, and are striving to throttle it out of existence with aid and abetment from their international allies.
I undertook, at that time, to write another series regarding the steps which Hindu society should take in order to break out of the siege, and snatch the initiative from its sworn enemies.</description>

      <description>1. Anything but a &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; party
The strange thing about the BJP is that its voters consider it a Hindu party, its enemies denounce it as a Hindu party, but the party will call itself anything except a Hindu party.
 Unlike most critics of the BJP, who tend to make their point by  quoting sources openly hostile to the party, we should prove our case by going to its own formulations of its ideology.</description>

      <description>1. Significance of Hindu Society
Hindu society is the only significant society in the world today which presents a continuity of cultural existence and functioning since times immemorial.
Most other societies known to human history-East and West, North and South-have suffered a sudden interruption and undergone a traumatic transformation due to the invasion and victory of latter-day ideologies-Christianity, Islam, Communism. The pre-Christian, pre-Islamic and pre-Communist cultural creations of these societies are now to be met only in libraries and museums, thanks to the labours of antiquarian scholars.</description>

      <description>1. Summary of the historical question 1.1 Before the Masjid, the Mandir The historical starting point of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue is the contention that the Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya was built after the forcible demolition of a Hindu temple on the same spot by Muslim soldiers. In the first part of my book Ram Janmabhoomi vs. Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim conflict,¹ I have dealt extensively with the arguments given pro and contra this contention.</description>

      <description>2. Immigration from Bangladesh
 2.1. The uses of migration
 In the demographic competition, simple procreation is not the  only factor. There are cases where Muslims are in a minority and use migration to remedy their minority condition. This does not, of course, mean that all Muslims involved in such migration are conscious soldiers in a demographic offensive (&amp;ldquo;infiltrators&amp;rdquo;), but an element of planning may nonetheless be involved, or may arise in certain activist circles once the political potential of an ongoing migration process becomes apparent.</description>

      <description>THE chief scenes in the War of 1857 being in Northern India, we had so long to dilate upon the warlike events in that region alone. But, in order to grasp even the general tenor of the War, it is necessary to see its manifestations in other provinces also. Therefore, while the tongues of fire of that tremendous conflagration are dancing up to the skies there, we must also case a passing glance at the sparks in other regions.</description>

AT the root of the malady of “untouchability” lies the belief among the common mass of people that it is part of dharma, and transgressing it would be a grave sin.</description>

The emergence of Catholic ashrams in several parts of the country is not an isolated development. These institutions are links in a chain which is known as the &amp;ldquo;Ashram Movement&amp;rdquo;, and which different denominations of Christianity are promoting in concert. The Protestants and the Syrian Orthodox have evolved similar establishments. Taken together, these institutions are known as Christian ashrams. Several books and many articles have already been devoted to the subject by noted Christian writers.</description>

Comrade Radek, whom Stalin liquidated in the late ‘thirties, was a Communist intellectual endowed with acid humour. He coined many jokes at the cost of the Communist Party and the Soviet State. One of these jokes which did the rounds in Moscow was as follows:
One day Comrade Radek stood stark naked in the Red Square in broad daylight. A courageous citizen approached and asked him, “Aren’t you afraid of the police, Comrade Commissar?</description>

NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON INDIAN HISTORY
Mathew Arnold had composed his famous lines with reference to a particular context. He had the Buddha and similar Hindu sages in mind when he wrote the following famous lines:
 The East bowed low before the blast,
In patient deep disdain;
She let the legions thunder past,
And plunged in thought again.
 Little did the poet suspect that his tribute to Hindu spirituality would be twisted to embellish an imperialist version of Indian history according to which the “meek Hindu” had always been preoccupied with sterile speculations, and seldom stood up in defence of his country and culture.</description>

      <description>Foreword
The present book is my last contribution to the literature on what is known in India as “communalism”, meaning the conflict between the different religions, principally Hinduism and Islam. Some of the authors whose works were published by Voice of India, notably Prof. Harsh Narain and Sri Suhas Majumdar, had only started speaking out on the communal question in the very last years of their lives. We must be grateful to them that they were willing to sacrifice their years of well-earned rest to a diagnosis of this unpleasant problem.</description>

      <description>Foreword
There was a time, not so long ago, when the exponents of jihãd minced no words and pulled no punches. They were brutally frank in spelling out what jihãd really meant.
But times have changed, particularly after the collapse of Christianity in the West and the rise of modern rationalism and humanism. Standards of moral judgment have increasingly tended to become universal, and no statement of faith can escape scrutiny simply because it is made in a book hailed as holy by some people.</description>

      <description>FROM GANDHISM TO COMMUNISM I had a brief encounter with the Sthanakavasi Svetambara sect of Jainism also, at about the same time. The school in which I was a student was a Svetambara Jam school. The relative with whom I stayed was also a Jain. There was a daily period in our school for teaching the elements of Jain dharma. But the Jam community which I saw from close quarters was too decadent, self centred, and morose for my taste.</description>

      <description>Indian Muslims
Prologue
There are books on Indian Muslims like M. Mujeeb’s The Indian Muslims (George Allen &amp;amp; Unwin, London, 1967) and Ram Gopal’s Indian Muslims (Asia Publishing House, Bombay, 1959). There are journals, Articles, and “Letters to the Editor” on Indian Muslims or Muslim Indians. But who are these Indian Muslims?
M. Mujeeb answers: “whoever they may be, and wherever they may be in India, the Indian Muslims take themselves for granted” (p.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION
This book will deal with items of faith central to the Christian tradition. It may therefore be in order to clarify where I stand vis-a-vis this tradition. For most practical purposes, I belong to the Catholic community in my country: schooling, membership of cultural organizations, trade-union etc. I confess (therewith upholding a Christian ritual) that several times, I have voted for the Christian-Democratic Party, a non-confessional party that vaguely adheres to “values” upheld by the Christian tradition.</description>

      <description>Independent India is engaged in a many-sided renaissance and reconstruction more or less consciously directed to what may compendiously be called nation-making (or remaking) in an image more adequate to the needs of the present and future of India as a strong, creative nation guiding the destinies of its people in accordance with a worthy and inspiring charter of life.
This era commenced roughly with the emergence and work of Raja Rammohan Roy in the beginning of the last century and has continued to the present day through the life- effort of notable thinkers in many fields like Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, Swami Dayananda, Sri Aurobindo and Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhi and Tagore, Dr.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION
The volume in hand is a reprint of an old book compiled in 1947 by Sardar Gurbachan Singh Talib, Principal of the Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jullundur, and published in 1950 by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). It records the story of 7-million Hindus and Sikhs who were uprooted from their homes in the West Punjab, the North-Western Frontier, Sind and parts of Kashmir. It tells the story of political parleys that preceded this event, their inevitable failure, and the barbarity that immediately followed - barbarity that had elements of pre-planning.</description>

The credit for the present compilation goes wholly to Dr. Shreerang Godbole. It was his letters written to us in August-September 1996 which prompted us to circulate in October 1996 an 8-page brochure - Time For Stock Taking: A Swayamsevak Speaks - which we reproduce below:

      <description>INTRODUCTION
Indications of a growth in the volume of interest in Buddhism are noticeable in some sections of the Indian people. Along with it there is naturally a growing demand for a clear and consistent statement of the life and teachings of the Buddha.
Anyone who is not a Buddhist finds it extremely difficult to present the life and teachings of the Buddha in a manner which would make it a consistent whole.</description>

(After thirteen years in England where he received a thoroughly Western education, Sri Aurobindo returned to India on February 6, 1893, at the age of twenty.
Bankim Chatterji&amp;rsquo;s Anandamath, which contained “Bande Mataram,” the hymn to the Motherland, had been published eleven years earlier. Swami Vivekananda had just come to the end of his first pilgrimage round India, and was preparing to sail for America.

      <description>PREFACE
A court order in 1986 threw open for Hindu worship the gates of the temple-turned-mosque at the Rãmajanmabhûmi at Ayodhya. Hindus were overjoyed, and started looking forward to the coming up of a grand Rãma Mandir at the sacred site. But they were counting without the stalwarts of Secularism in the Nehruvian establishment. It was not long before a hysterical cry was heard – “Secularism in danger!”
The Marxist-Muslim combine launched a two-pronged campaign.</description>

In my book The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India, I had said that “It is not, pertinent here to make a detailed study of the Muslim slave system which was an institution as peculiar as it was unique.” A detailed study of the Muslim slave system in medieval India is being made here. In The Legacy I had also said that “the best way to understand the content and spirit of Muslim rule in India… is by going through Muslim scriptures (as) all medieval chroniclers were scholars of Muslim law.</description>

      <description>Swatantryaveer Savarkar needs no introduction to the Indian public, neither does his biography. Long ago, Mr. Asaf Ali described Savarkar as the spirit of Shivaji and the late Sri Srinivas Sastri said of him that “ he was a great and fear- less patriot and volumes could be written about his yeoman services in the cause of Indian Freedom.” This is, however, too small a volume to describe that spirit and those services adequately.</description>

      <description>Preface
The movement for the restoration of the Ramajanmabhumi Temple at Ayodhya has brought to the fore a suppressed chapter of India’s history, namely, the large-scale destruction of Hindu temples^(1) by the Islamised invaders. This chapter is by no means closed. The Appendix to this book provides details of many temples destroyed by Muslims all over Bangladesh as recently as October-November 1989. Currently, temples, or whatever had remained of them, are meeting a similar fate in the Kashmir valley.</description>

      <description>Preface to the Second Edition
The first edition of this book, published in 1986, had 16 chapters and an appendix. This second edition has 25 chapters. The appendix - Encounter at Pondicherry - has been fitted in the chronology of encounters and forms Chapter 7 of the new edition. Chapter 14 of the old edition has been split into two chapters, 15 and 16, separating the debate on the Fundamental Right to Propagate Religion from the debate in the Constituent Assembly.</description>

      <description>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION
The first two editions of this book were published in quick succession - July 1986 and July 1987 - because it was received with great interest and appreciation by the Hindu intelligentsia at large, in this country and abroad. But the present (third) edition has been delayed inordinately in spite of persistent demand after the second edition went out of print in 1988. A reprint of the second edition was not brought out because I wanted to include in a new edition the copious materials which I had collected in the meanwhile from orthodox collections of Hadis and which I thought worth presenting to the readers.</description>

      <description>OF all the surprising incidents connected with the Revolution of 1857, the most striking was the secrecy with which the vast movement was organised. The clever English administrators had so little information about the source of the movement, even after the tremendous revolutionary upheaval all over Hindusthan, that, even a year after open mutiny had broken out, most of them still persisted innocently in the brief that it was due to the greased cartridges!</description>

      <description>It is a simple truism patent even to the uneducated that the most tiny house cannot be built without a foundation strong enough to support its weight. When writers who profess to write the history of the Revolution that was enacted in India in 1857 ignore this common sense principle and do not try to discuss the real causes that led to it and impudently maintain that the vast edifice of the Revolution was built on a blade of straw, they must either be fools or, what is more probable, knaves.</description>

      <description>AFTER declaring her Independence on the 11th of May, the city of Delhi had been busy in organising the wild storm, that such a bold step has raised into a systematised revolution. By restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the ancient throne of the Moguls, the citizens of Delhi had already created a nucleus mighty enough, by the very prestige of its name, to sustain the struggle of a people&amp;rsquo;s liberation.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
WHAT IS DUTY? It is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga to know what duty is. If I have to do something I must first know that it is my duty, and then I can do it. The idea of duty again is different in different nations. The Mohammedan says what is written in his book, the Koran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the Vedas is his duty; and the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
WE HELP OURSELVES, NOT THE WORLD Before considering further how devotion to duty helps us in our spiritual progress, let me place before you in a brief compass another aspect of what we in India mean by Karma. In every religion there are three parts: philosophy, mythology, and ritual. Philosophy of course is the essence of every religion; mythology explains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary lives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things, and so on; ritual gives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so that every one may grasp it — ritual is in fact concretised philosophy.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
NON-ATTACHMENT IS COMPLETE SELF-ABNEGATION Just as every action that emanates from us comes back to us as reaction, even so our actions may act on other people and theirs on us. Perhaps all of you have observed it as a fact that when persons do evil actions, they become more and more evil, and when they begin to do good, they become stronger and stronger and learn to do good at all times.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
FREEDOM In addition to meaning work, we have stated that psychologically the word Karma also implies causation. Any work, any action, any thought that produces an effect is called a Karma. Thus the law of Karma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and sequence. Wheresoever there is a cause, there an effect must be produced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this law of Karma, according to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole universe.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
THE IDEAL OF KARMA-YOGA The grandest idea in the religion of the Vedanta is that we may reach the same goal by different paths; and these paths I have generalised into four, viz those of work, love, psychology, and knowledge. But you must, at the same time, remember that these divisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of each other. Each blends into the other. But according to the type which prevails, we name the divisions.</description>

PREFACE Since the dawn of history, various extraordinary phenomena have been recorded as happening amongst human beings. Witnesses are not wanting in modern times to attest to the fact of such events, even in societies living under the full blaze of modern science. The vast mass of such evidence is unreliable, as coming from ignorant, superstitious, or fraudulent persons. In many instances the so-called miracles are imitations. But what do they imitate?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY All our knowledge is based upon experience. What we call inferential knowledge, in which we go from the less to the more general, or from the general to the particular, has experience as its basis. In what are called the exact sciences, people easily find the truth, because it appeals to the particular experiences of every human being. The scientist does not tell you to believe in anything, but he has certain results which come from his own experiences, and reasoning on them when he asks us to believe in his conclusions, he appeals to some universal experience of humanity.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE FIRST STEPS Rāja-Yoga is divided into eight steps. The first is Yama — non-killing, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-receiving of any gifts. Next is Niyama — cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study, and self-surrender to God. Then comes Âsana, or posture; Prānāyāma, or control of Prāna; Pratyāhāra, or restraint of the senses from their objects; Dhāranā, or fixing the mind on a spot; Dhyāna, or meditation; and Samādhi, or superconsciousness.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
PRANA Prānāyāma is not, as many think, something about breath; breath indeed has very little to do with it, if anything. Breathing is only one of the many exercises through which we get to the real Pranayama. Pranayama means the control of Prāna. According to the philosophers of India, the whole universe is composed of two materials, one of which they call Âkāsha. It is the omnipresent, all-penetrating existence.</description>

THE PSYCHIC PRANA According to the Yogis, there are two nerve currents in the spinal column, called Pingalā and Idā, and a hollow canal called Sushumnā running through the spinal cord. At the lower end of the hollow canal is what the Yogis call the &amp;ldquo;Lotus of the Kundalini&amp;rdquo;. They describe it as triangular in form in which, in the symbolical language of the Yogis, there is a power called the Kundalini, coiled up.</description>

Nothing symbolizes better the absurdity of Partition than Kashmir. Nehru and Gandhi’s folly of accepting the division of the country on geographical-religion lines has come back to haunt India with a vengeance. For, Pakistan, apart from the fact that it was created and survives on its hatred of ‘Hindu’ India, has a point: if Nehru accepted that Muslim-dominated parts of India go to Pakistan, why not also the Valley of Kashmir, which is today in Muslim majority, thanks to decades of terror to induce the once strong Hindu community to flee ?</description>

INTRODUCTION
Tipu Sultan had, ruled his kingdom only for sixteen-and-a-half years, from December 7, 1782 to May 4, 1799. The territory of Malabar was under his effective control only for a short period of eight years. If he had not secured the assistance of the wily Purnaiyya, there would not have been so many Muhammadans in the states of Kerala and Karnataka.</description>

Cultural Self-Alienation Among the Hindus1
When two cultures meet on unequal military terms - as the Hindu culture met the West and earlier met Islam - it gives rise to grave problems of self-identity for the defeated party. When India finally realized that she had lost in the military and diplomatic contest and that the British were supreme, she was overwhelmed and filled with a deep sense of inferiority.</description>

Introduction
1.1. THE RISE OF ISLAM
Professor R.P. Tripathi begins his famous monograph entitled Some Aspects of Muslim Administration, by writing that the Muslim &amp;ldquo;invaders gradually wormed themselves into the heart of India, and finally assumed the role of the earlier Hindu Empire-builders like Chandra Gupta, Samudra Gupta and even Harsha&amp;hellip; The Muslim Sultan, however, differed from the earlier Hindu sovereigns in two respects. He did not belong to the country over which he had come to rule&amp;hellip; Secondly, he believed in a religion whose outlook on social and political questions was very different from that of the Hindus.</description>

(Bauddhika) Kshatriya
DAVID FRAWLEY
We live in the age of the information revolution, which has taken a quantum leap since the introduction of computers. The information flood is changing the nature of the society in which we live, in ways that we do not yet know and for which there is no precedent. This information revolution is in many respects an information war, with different groups struggling to put their views out to the general public as the truth.</description>

      <description>1. Credal definitions
“The question is”, said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.”
“The question is”, said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master-that’s all.”^(1)
A lot of ink has flowed over the question how to define Hinduism. There is no other religion for which the question of definition is so difficult. A Roman Catholic could be defined as a person who is baptized by a priest ordained within an apostolic succession going back to Jesus, and who accepts the Nicean Creed and the authority of the Bishop of Rome.</description>

      <description>1. The Ayodhya debate: focus on the “no temple” evidence
In May 1998, the World Archaeological Congress held a conference on the island of Brac, Croatia, where a session was devoted to the Ayodhya dispute. I had registered to read a paper, and though I couldn’t make it to the conference due to unforeseen family matters, I had prepared the following text.
1.1.Two sides to the story
In references to the question whether there really was a Hindu temple at the Ayodhya site later covered by the Babri Masjid, the focus is invariably on the case made by the Hindu side, viz.</description>

      <description>1. Summary of the historical question 1.1 Before the Masjid, the Mandir The historical starting point of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue is the contention that the Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya was built after the forcible demolition of a Hindu temple on the same spot by Muslim soldiers. In the first part of my book Ram Janmabhoomi vs. Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim conflict,¹ I have dealt extensively with the arguments given pro and contra this contention.</description>

Sanãtana Dharma Versus Prophetic Creeds
The one Vedic verse which modern Hindus quote most frequently is the third quarter (caraNa) of Rigveda 1.164.46 – Ekam sad viprãh bahudhã vadanti (it is of One Existence that the wise ones speak in diverse ways).
The full mantra reads as follows:
 Indram mitram varuNam agnim ãhuh,
atho divyah sa suparNo garutmãn,
ekam sad viprãh bahudhã vadanti,
agnim yamam mãtarišvãnam ãhuh.
 (They hail Him as Indra, as Mitra, as VaruNa, as Agni, also as that divine and noble-winged Garutmãn.</description>

      <description>2. &amp;ldquo;Equal respect for all religions&amp;rdquo;
 The only explicitly Indian contribution in the cited BJS/BJP  self-declarations is of doubtful value: &amp;ldquo;positive secularism&amp;rdquo; defined as &amp;ldquo;sarva-dharma-samabhava&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;equal respect for all religions&amp;rdquo;. We let the difference with the original European concept of secularism (equal indifference towards all religions, equal independence from all religions) pass, and focus on the problematic meaning of the slogan defining this &amp;ldquo;positive secularism&amp;rdquo;. Two meanings are attested: the political meaning apparently given to it in the cited BJP texts, viz.</description>

      <description>2. The Residue of Islamism
The most malevolent of these residues is Islamism, the residue of the Muslim invasion of India spread over several centuries. Its basic tenets are ultimately derived from the teachings of Islam which has so far succeeded in sealing itself off from every shade of empiricism, rationalism, universalism, humanism and liberalism, the hallmarks of Hindu as well as modern Western culture. But in the context of India where Islam failed in its mission of lasting conquest and total conversion, these tenets have acquired a singularly sinister and subversive character.</description>

      <description>3. The Muslim birth rate
3.1. Muslim fertility
 Is there anything demonstrably intentional about this Islamic  demographic expansion? In an article seeking to &amp;ldquo;explode the myth&amp;rdquo; of Muslim demographic aggression, journalists Namita Bhandare, Louise Fernandes and Minu Jain themselves admit that according to official surveys, &amp;ldquo;the disapproval of family planning is highest among Muslims&amp;rdquo;, while &amp;ldquo;the practice of family planning methods in 1980 was lowest amongst Muslims (only 23% of those surveyed practised it as opposed to 36% Hindus)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Early Muslims
No integrated contemporary account exists to say how Islam spread in India. Medieval chroniclers very graphically describe the achievements of Muslim invaders, conquerors, monarchs, governors, rulers of independent Muslims kingdoms, and even officials, in effecting conversions. Muslim hagiological works, some reliable others not so reliable, too report on addition to Muslim population through conversions. But the actual numbers who embraced Islam year after year and decade after decade are not known.</description>

Indigenisation: A Predatory Enterprise
The precedent cited most frequently by the literature of Indigenisation is that which was set by the Greek Fathers when they used Greek cultural forms for conveying Christianity to the pagans in the Roman Empire. Fr. Bede recommends this precedent to the mission in India. &amp;ldquo;The Church,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;has a perfect model of how it should proceed today in the way it proceeded in the early centuries.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 3 - The Sources Of Leftist Language Leftist professors and publicists claim that their language got formulated in the course of India&amp;rsquo;s fight for freedom from British rule. They also claim that this language was used in the field at various stages of the struggle for freedom. This is a plain and a big lie. The annals of that freedom struggle provide no evidence that this language was used in India&amp;rsquo;s politics till the late thirties of this century.</description>

Some of the guidelines seem to be good. It is eminently desirable that “the ancient period of Indian history cannot be referred to as the Hindu period and the medieval period as the Muslim period”. It follows, though it is not mentioned in the guidelines reported by the Indian Express, that the modern period of Indian history also will not be named as the British period.</description>

Under Hajjâj bin Yûsuf&amp;rsquo;s orders, MuHammad bin Qâism, a nineteen year old Arab, conquered Sindh in 712 A.D. and imposed Jizyah on the Hindus and Buddhists unwilling to embrace Islam, excepting, however, BrâhmaNa-s and ascetics.</description>

In most Christian countries (i.e. with the exception of some frontier areas of the missions), the trend is the same, even if less dramatic.</description>

      <description>WHEN the Sikh Sepoys delivered the Allahabad fort into the hands of the English, instead of into the hands of the Revolutionaries, the English made it a base of operations on their side. There was now no longer the danger of having to carry on all civil and military operations in the North India from a distant centre like Calcutta. Lond Canning decided to shift the capital itself to Allahabad until the Revolution was suppressed and, accordingly, he came in a few days to reside at Allahabad.</description>

      <description>To this category of names which have been to mankind a subtle source of life and inspiration belongs the word Hindutva, the essential nature and significance of which we have to investigate into. The ideas and ideals, the systems and societies, the thoughts and sentiments which have centered round this name are so varied and rich, so powerful and so subtle, so elusive and yet so vived that the term Hindutva defies all attempts at analysis.</description>

      <description>II
1910-1922
(On April 4, 1910, Sri Aurobindo, still wanted by the British, reached Pondicherry clandestinely. A third charge of sedition against him, for an article in the Karmayogin, failed in his absence. For several years he was going to live in this French colony as a fugitive, with spies and rumours hovering about him and his small group of companions.
For some time Sri Aurobindo thought of returning to British India, but he soon saw that “enough had been done to change the whole face of Indian politics and the whole spirit of the Indian people to make independence its aim,” as he wrote later.</description>

      <description>THE seed of rvolutionary martyrdom soaked in the blood of Mangal Panday was not long in taking root. The Subahdar of the 34th regiment was charged with holding secret revolutionary meetings at night and beheaded. And when documents were found proving that the 19th and 34th regiments had secretly planned to raise a revolution, they were both disarmed and disbanded. This was a &amp;ldquo;punishment&amp;rdquo; in the eyes of the Government, but the Sepoys of these regiments looked upon it at as great honour.</description>

[Text provided by Eleanor Zelliot, as prepared by Vasant Moon]
A question is always asked to me: how I happen[ed] to take such [a] high degree of education. Another question is being asked: why I am inclined towards Buddhism. These questions are asked because I was born in a community known in India as the &amp;ldquo;Untouchables.</description>

      <description>PREFACE
This book is intended to reveal the grim and tragic story of the uprooting of more than seven million Hindus and Sikhs from their homes in West Punjab, in the North-Western Frontier Province, in Sind and in raider-occupied Kashmir. The outlines of this story are well-known all over the world, and have formed the subject of debate before the representatives of the major portion of mankind, assembled in the United Nations.</description>

      <description>PREFACE
It was the summer of 1982. VOICE OF INDIA had hardly started its programme of publications. One fine morning an aged and visibly ailing sannyasi dropped in at my office in New Delhi. He had travelled all the way from some place (I forget the name) in Andhra Pradesh. Someone had given him a copy of my booklet, Hindu Society Under Siege, and having read the chapter, ‘Residue of Christianism’, he had concluded that I was the guy he had been looking for.</description>

      <description>Preface
This is a slightly enlarged version of a small monograph I wrote in Bengali on the important Islamic subject of Jihãd fi Sabilillah (war in the way of Allah). Jihãd has five clear components, and a complete understanding of the subject requires a discussion of each one of them. Thus jihãd stands for (1) Forcible expansion of Islam; (2) Destruction of infidels; (3) Establishment of jizyah on the subdued infidel population; (4) Plunder in the form of properties wrested from infidels; and (5) Plunder in the form of enslaved female and child population acquired from the vanquished infidels.</description>

      <description>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
Soon after the first edition of this book was published in July 1986, a significant judgment on some Ayats of the Quran was pronounced by Z.S. Lohat, metropolitan magistrate of Delhi. As most of these Ayats and others of a similar sort figure in the Calcutta Quran Petition of Chandmal Chopra, we thought it relevant to reproduce the impugned poster in which the Ayats were cited. Operative portion of the judgment is also being reproduced in order to give a glimpse of the arguments for and against.</description>

      <description>Preface to the First Edition
Christian historians, in India and abroad, have written many accounts of how Christian theologians, missionaries and warlords have looked at Hinduism^(1) in different phases of Christian aggression against this ancient religion and culture. But there is no connected account of how Hindu thinkers, saints and sages have viewed Christianity and its exclusive claims. The present study is an attempt to fill that gap. It is far from being exhaustive.</description>

      <description>On December 12, 1935, I received the following letter from Mr. Sant Ram, the Secretary of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal :
 My dear Doctor Saheb,
Many thanks for your kind letter of the 5th December. I have released it for press without your permission for which I beg your pardon, as I saw no harm in giving it publicity. You are a great thinker, and it is my well-considered opinion that none else has studied the problem of Caste so deeply as you have.</description>

      <description>SEEDS THAT WERE TO SPROUT Four years after leaving college I was ready to join the Communist Party of India when it declared war on the newly born Republic of India in February 1948. I conveyed my decision to my friend Ram Swarup, whom I had met after leaving college and who was to exercise a decisive influence on my intellectual evolution. He wrote back immediately: &amp;ldquo;You are too intelligent not to become a Communist.</description>

      <description>Some Excerpts The next generation of political leaders, especially the left-wing that was to gain control of Congress in the thirties, and complete control in the fifties, would profess negationism very explicitly. The radical humanist (i.e. bourgeois Marxist) M.N. Roy wrote that Islam had fulfilled a historic mission of equality and abolition of discrimination, and that for this, Islam had been welcomed into India by the lower castes. If at all any violence had occurred, it was as a matter of justified class struggle by the progressive forces against the reactionary forces, meaning the fedual Hindu upper castes.</description>

      <description>If it is true that the question whether India, bounded by the Himalayas on the north and the Ocean on tne south, should be completely independent or not, was being solved on the battlefields of the war of 1857, then the chain of causes begins from that day in 1757 when the question was first raised. On the 23rd of June in 1757, the question whether India should belong to the Indians or to the English was openly discussed, for the first time, on the field of Plassey.</description>

      <description>ON the 20th of June, 1858, in the fierce fight on the maidan at Gwalior, Ranee Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi fell. But though one inveterate enemy of the English was thus taken away from the scene, the other, equally inveterate and, perhaps, more skilful in the tactics of war, had effected a clever retreat. He disappeared from Gwalior on the 20th, he disappeared, also, from the field of Jaura Alipur on the 22nd, and away he went out to the reach of the English – but where?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
THE CONTROL OF PSYCHIC PRANA We have now to deal with the exercises in Prānāyāma. We have seen that the first step, according to the Yogis, is to control the motion of the lungs. What we want to do is to feel the finer motions that are going on in the body. Our minds have become externalised, and have lost sight of the fine motions inside. If we can begin to feel them, we can begin to control them.</description>

PRATYAHARA AND DHARANA The next step is called Pratyāhāra. What is this? You know how perceptions come. First of all there are the external instruments, then the internal organs acting in the body through the brain centres, and there is the mind. When these come together and attach themselves to some external object, then we perceive it. At the same time it is a very difficult thing to concentrate the mind and attach it to one organ only; the mind is a slave.</description>

DHYANA AND SAMADHI We have taken a cursory view of the different steps in Rāja-Yoga, except the finer ones, the training in concentration, which is the goal to which Raja-Yoga will lead us.

My consciousness of this table, and of your presence, makes me know that the table and you are here.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
RAJA-YOGA IN BRIEF The following is a summary of Rāja-Yoga freely translated from the Kurma-Purāna.
The fire of Yoga burns the cage of sin that is around a man. Knowledge becomes purified and Nirvāna is directly obtained. From Yoga comes knowledge; knowledge again helps the Yogi. He who combines in himself both Yoga and knowledge, with him the Lord is pleased. Those that practice Mahāyoga, either once a day, or twice a day, or thrice, or always, know them to be gods.</description>

      <description>PATANJALI&amp;rsquo;S YOGA APHORISMS
INTRODUCTION Before going into the Yoga aphorisms I shall try to discuss one great question, upon which rests the whole theory of religion for the Yogis. It seems the consensus of opinion of the great minds of the world, and it has been nearly demonstrated by researches into physical nature, that we are the outcome and manifestation of an absolute condition, back of our present relative condition, and are going forward, to return to that absolute.</description>

CHAPTER I
CONCENTRATION: ITS SPIRITUAL USES अथ योगानुशासनम् ॥१॥
1. Now concentration is explained.
योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥२॥
2. Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Chitta) from taking various forms (Vrittis).
A good deal of explanation is necessary here. We have to understand what Chitta is, and what the Vrittis are. I have eyes. Eyes do not see. Take away the brain centre which is in the head, the eyes will still be there, the retinae complete, as also the pictures of objects on them, and yet the eyes will not see.</description>

CHAPTER II
CONCENTRATION: ITS PRACTICE तपः स्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि क्रियायोगः ॥१॥
1. Mortification, study, and surrendering fruits of work to God are called Kriyā-yoga.
Those Samādhis with which we ended our last chapter are very difficult to attain; so we must take them up slowly. The first step, the preliminary step, is called Kriya-yoga. Literally this means work, working towards Yoga. The organs are the horses, the mind is the rein, the intellect is the charioteer, the soul is the rider, and the body is the chariot.</description>

CHAPTER III
POWERS We have now come to the chapter in which the Yoga powers are described.
देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥१॥
1. Dhāranā is holding the mind on to some particular object.
Dharana (concentration) is when the mind holds on to some object, either in the body, or outside the body, and keeps itself in that state.
तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥२॥
2. An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is Dhyāna.</description>

CHAPTER IV
INDEPENDENCE जन्मौषधि-मन्त्र-तपः-समाधिजाः सिद्धयः ॥१॥
1. The Siddhis (powers) are attained by birth, chemical means, power of words, mortification, or concentration.
Sometimes a man is born with the Siddhis, powers, of course, those he had earned in his previous incarnation. This time he is born, as it were, to enjoy the fruits of them. It is said of Kapila, the great father of the Sānkhya philosophy, that he was a born Siddha, which means literally a man who has attained to success.</description>

अग्निर्यत्राभिमथ्यते वायुर्यत्राधिरुध्यते ।

6. Where the fire is rubbed, where the air is controlled, where the Soma flows over, there a (perfect) mind is created.

      <description>3. THE CHRISTIANS : A MINORITY IN MORAL MAJORITY
Many of us in the West – at least those born in the forties and early fifties – grew-up hearing of the wonderful and ‘saintly’ work done by the &amp;ldquo;White&amp;rdquo; missionaries in far away and dangerous (that is jungle and snake-infested) countries, where lived &amp;ldquo;Savages&amp;rdquo;, waiting to be converted to the civilizing influence of Christianity. The reality which I discovered in India was totally different: while there is no doubt that Christian missionaries have done a remarkable work in the fields of education and health, their prime purpose remains - even today - to convert the ‘heathen’ Hindus to the True God – by any means.</description>

TIPU&amp;rsquo;S OWN TESTIMONY
C. NANDAGOPAL MENON
(The writer is convenor of Bombay Malayalee Samajam)
&amp;ldquo;If you love me, should you not put up with my weakness sometimes?&amp;rdquo; - Tipu Sultan is purported to have asked Mir Sadik who was one of his ministers. This is a remark invented by Bhagwan S. Gidwani in his controversial novel, The Sword of Tipu Sultan.
Across-section of the new generation of historians and novelists is of the opinion that all the available documents and history books on Tipu Sultan originate from the British and, therefore, they cannot be relied upon, the ostensible policy of the British being to &amp;lsquo;divide and rule&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3
Buddhism vis-a-vis Hinduism1
Buddhism is returning home to India after a long exile of a thousand years and, like the proverbial prodigal son, is being received with open arms. Religious tolerance of the average Hindu partly explains the warm reception. But a very important reason is the fact that Buddha and Buddhism form an intimate part of Hindu consciousness. Buddha was a Hindu. Buddhism is Hindu in its origin and development, in its art and architecture, iconography, language, beliefs, psychology, names, nomenclature, religious vows and spiritual discipline.</description>

      <description>II
The State
Muslim rule in India has been conveniently divided into two periods, the Sultanate of Delhi (1206-1526) and the Mughal empire (1526-1707). it continued up to 1857, though in the later stages only nominally. When the Sultanate was established, it carried with it the experience gained by the Arab rule in Sindh and the Ghaznavid rule in Punjab of about two centuries. Meanwhile a well-developed statecraft had sprung up in Muslim countries during the seventh to the twelfth centuries.</description>

IN SEARCH OF A CULPRIT
The communist and fellow-travelling press and platforms in this country are busy building up and defending India&amp;rsquo;s Defence Minister, Mr. V.K. Krishna Menon, in the face of what the leftists describe as &amp;ldquo;an upsurge of rightist reaction&amp;rdquo;. Krishna Menon himself struts about with an air of injured innocence, and frequently dons the mask of a much misunderstood martyr whose services to the nation have not been properly appreciated.</description>

Encounter on the Euphrates
Christian historians will have us believe that Hinduism first came in contact with Christianity in AD 52 when St. Thomas, an apostle of Jesus Christ, landed in Malabar. He is supposed to have travelled in South India and founded seven churches before he was. “murdered” by the “malicious” Brahmanas. The old Christians in Kerala, who knew as well as introduced themselves as Syrian Christians till the other day, now take pride in calling themselves St.</description>

One of the diversionary tactics employed by the “eminent historians” in order to shield Islamic iconoclasm from the public eye is to allege that Hinduism itself is the guilty religion, viz. of persecuting minority religions such as Buddhism. So much is this accusation now taken for granted, that any attempt to stick to the historical record fills the secularists with exasperation at such Hindu fanatical blindness.</description>

      <description>2. Hindus as “Indian Pagans”
2.1. Historical definition of “Hindu”
In Hindu scriptures, the word “Hindu” is not to be found. Yet, long before Western scholars sat down to invent definitions of “Hindu”, the term already carried a definite meaning. The normal procedure ought to be, to listen to this original version first. It was brought into India by the Islamic invaders, and meant: “Indian Pagan”.
The term “Hindu” is the Persian equivalent of the Indo-Aryan term “Sindhu”, “river”, “the Indus”.</description>

SITA RAM GOEL
1. Ideological aggression, if not resisted in proper time, leads invariably to physical aggression.
2. Instead of promoting a physical clash, ideological defence
 i. prevents it most of the time because the aggressor stands warned that he would be resisted;
ii. or minimises one-sided violence because the victim also stands well-prepared;
iii. and often helps the aggressor to drop his habit because he comes to know that the other side knows his designs or that there is another side of the story.</description>

Belief and history 2.1 The belief in Ram The near-certainty that the temple which stood on the Babri Masjid spot was a celebrated Ram temple, does not clinch the issue of whether Ram was actually born on that very spot. We do know that the Hindu culture, even more than most traditional cultures, has shown a tremendous capacity of preserving traditions, poetic compositions as voluminous as the Vedas, and the information contained therein.</description>

The Spiritual Centre of Hindu Society
Hindu society has had to go on the defensive against monotheistic creeds masquerading as religion mainly because it has lost consciousness of the spiritual centre round which its religious, cultural and social life has revolved, and which has sustained it through the ages.
Hindu society has failed to fathom the chasm which separates its own sterling spirituality from the “only true” creeds because it has fallen in love with a dead uniformity in place of a living plurality prescribed by its own spiritual centre.</description>

      <description>3. The Residue of Christianism
The British rule in India crystallised two residues-Christianism and Macaulayism.
Certain strains of Macaulayism developed what is euphemistically described as a “revolutionary temper” in the later stages of the British rule and joined hands with Communism after the Bolshevik victory in Russia. The whole of Communism, which is also hostile to Hindu society and culture, is not Macaulayism. Yet, if Macaulayism had not prepared the ideological ground, Communism could not have made the strides it did in this country.</description>

      <description>3. What is Wrong with &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;?
 To an extent, the avoidance of the term &amp;quot;Hindu&amp;quot; has  characterized many earlier avatars of Hindu nationalism. Sri Aurobindo titled his newspaper &amp;ldquo;Arya&amp;rdquo;, and declared that India would rise with &amp;ldquo;Sanatana Dharma&amp;rdquo;, a more profound term than the colloquial &amp;ldquo;Hinduism&amp;rdquo;. The Arya Samaj preferred the term &amp;ldquo;Vedic&amp;rdquo;, or the Vedic term &amp;ldquo;Arya&amp;rdquo; (denoting adherence to Vedic civilizational standards), to the originally purely geographical Persian term &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;.</description>

4.1. Islam condoning birth control
 It is routinely assumed in Hindu circles that Islam prohibits  family planning. But against the talk of Muslim &amp;ldquo;demographic aggression&amp;rdquo;, secularists like to emphasize that, unlike Christianity and Judaism, Islam explicitly allows birth control. And this is entirely correct. As Yoginder Sikand argues, &amp;ldquo;Islam is one of the few religions that allow for birth control&amp;rdquo;.[1]
 In the Golden Age of Islam (7th-11th century), various writers  freely wrote instructions for birth control, e.</description>

      <description>THE province of Behar and its capital, Patna, did not remain aloof from the wave of Revolution which was sweeping over the North- Western Provinces, Allahabad, Agra, and Bengal. Of the different districts in the province, the chief towns were Gaya, Arrah, Chapra, Motihari, and Muzzafferpore. The army to control the province was stationed near Patna, in the town of Danapur. There was the 7th, 8th, and 40th native infantry and, to keep these in check, there were the European artillery and a European regiment, all under the command of Major-General Lloyd; besides, there was the 12th native cavalry regiment under Major Holmes stationed near by, at Sigwali.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 1
A GOVERNMENT IN PANIC
Muslims in India have often sought shelter under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C.) for preventing every public discussion of their creed in general and of their prophet in particular.^(1) Quite a few publications which examine critically the sayings and doings of the Prophet or other idolized personalities of Islam, have been proscribed under Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2
Rise of Muslims under the Sultanate
Muslim population in India grew with the expansion of Turkish rule in Hindustan. Its rise was due mainly to the immigration of Muslims from abroad and conversion of Hindus to Islam. There were Muslim losses also, in wars, famines, and through reconversions, and there was the growth of Muslim numbers through natural procreation in years and decades. We study all these processes, to begin with between C.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 4 - The Character of Leftist Language Ever since its inauguration in the opening years of this century, the language of Leftism has been the loudest in denouncing this or that imperialism. Quite often, it has imagined or invented an imperialism where none existed. This exercise has helped it to hide the fact that it itself is the latest language of imperialism.
Imperialism down the ages has evolved and employed a number of languages.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Slavery is the system by which certain persons are kept as the property of others - a system of great antiquity and wide prevalence. Slavery originated during the age of savagery and continued into ancient civilizations. As Nieboer has said, “the taming of animals naturally leads to taming of men.” it is supposed that the nomadic herdsman who domesticated animals also began to domesticate, to enslave, men. Slavery was there in Babylon and elsewhere in Mesopotamia; it was widely prevalent in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, centuries before the coming of Christ.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
FRUSTRATION OF THE GHAZNAVIDS
The standard text-books of Indian history taught in our schools and colleges do not highlight at all the stupendous failure of the Islamised Arabs in the face of heroic Hindu resistance. What they highlight instead is the series of successful raids made by Mahmud Ghaznavi into the heartland of India, and the subsequent crumbling of Hindu kingdoms in North India before the determined onslaughts of Muhammad Ghuri.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
PLEA FOR A PERSPECTIVE
Let us now consider the next guideline from the NCERT, namely, that “characterisation of the medieval period as a time of conflict between Hindus and Muslims is forbidden”.
The underlying assumption is that Muslims invaders of India in the medieval period were as good natives and patriots as the Hindus who resisted them, and that the numerous wars which the Hindus were forced to fight with the Muslim marauders were nothing more than domestic discords.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER III
THE NATIONAL HISTORICAL TRADITION
The Partition of India which the national leadership conceded in principle in 1947 was a gross violation of the national territorial tradition which had always cherished the whole of Bharatavarsha as a single and indivisible Hindu homeland. But what was still more serious, it was also a flagrant betrayal of the national historical tradition which had never accepted the consolidation of any foreign conquest in any part of Bharatavarsha as a settle fact, final for all time.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER ONE - NEGATIONISM IN GENERAL Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity. It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but the denial of known facts. The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941-45, also known as the holocaust (Greek: fire sacrifice) or the Shoah (Hebrew: disaster). Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history in such a way that the fact of the Holocaust is omitted.</description>

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PROPHETISM
The main part of this book is intended as an introduction to important findings in Bible research from the angle of psychology, with the emphasis on the work of the Flemish Bible scholar and psychologist Dr. Somers (parts of chapters 3.6 to 3.10 are little more than a re-wording of his original writings).
2.1. A Jesuit breaks free
Dr. Herman H. Somers, born in Antwerp on 3 October 1921, is an accomplished scholar with acclaimed contributions in many fields of learning.</description>

The Report of the Minorities’ Commission provides some historical background. So does the Note from the Government of Gujarat.</description>

The Tip of An Iceberg
Sita Ram Goel
The mention made by Maulana Abdul Hai (Indian Express, February 5) of Hindu temples turned into mosques, is only the tip of an iceberg, The iceberg itself lies submerged in the writings of medieval Muslim historians, accounts of foreign travellers and the reports of the Archaeological Survey of India. A hue and cry has been raised in the name of secularism and national integration whenever the iceberg has chanced to surface, inspite of hectic efforts to keep it suppressed.</description>

      <description>NOW that the volcano has temporarily subsided, renders might, however, ask what became of Feroze Shah and Rao Sahib?
After leaving Tatia, Rao Sahib fought desperately for a month and at last retired to the forests in disguise. At the end of about three years, he was also caught and was handed at Cawnpore on the 20th of August, 1862. Feroze Shah was also roaming about in disguise, but, fortunately, in the end, he got out of India and stayed at Kerbela in Persia.</description>

      <description>NANA Sahib Peshwa had been to Delhi towards the end of April and all were anxiously awaiting Sunday, the 31st of May, agreed upon as the day of rising. If the whole of Hindusthan had risen simultaneously on the 31st of May, history would not have had to wait longer than 1857 to record the destruction of the English empire and the victorious Independence of India. But the premature rising of Meerut benefited the English much more than the Revolutionaries.</description>

He writes in 1645 A.D. to one of his compatriots severely protesting against the allegation of being faithless to the Shah of Vijapur, and appealed to superior morals by reminding him that the only faith they pledged was not to any Shah, but to God alone. Did he not in company of Dadaji, his guardian, and his comrades solemnly swear in the presence of God on the summits of Sahyadri to fight to a finish and establish ‘Hindavi Swaraj’, a Hindu-Pad- Padshahi in Hindusthan?</description>

THE SUNSHINE OF ‘SECULARISM’
Hindus from early seventeenth century Pandits of Tamil Nadu to Arun Shourie in the closing years of the twentieth, have spent no end of ink and breath to demolish the dogma of Christianity and denounce missionary methods. But it has hardly made any difference to the arrogance of Christian theologians and aggressiveness of Christian missionaries. That is because the dogma was never meant for discussion. It is an axiom of logic that that which has not been proved cannot and need not be disproved.</description>

      <description>PAKISTAN-BIRTH AND OBJECTIVES
Pakistan grew out of the two-nation theory of the Muslim League, which for the last twenty years or more has been synonymous with its permanent president, the late Mohamed Ali Jinnah, called by the Muslims Qaid-i-Azam or the Supreme Leader. The career of Qaid-i-Azam Jinnah indicates a curious and. ironic development from being ‘the apostle of Hindu-Muslim Unity, as he was called by admiring Congressmen, to being the chief exponent, advocate and creator of Pakistan-a state based upon the thesis that the Muslims of India are a separate nation, and a,, such need a homeland and state for themselves, separate from Hindu-land.</description>

      <description>The situation: the rapidly increasing proportion of Abrahamists in India (and more broadly, worldwide), leading to Hindu composition falling below the 50% mark at least before 2100 (see GS) if we fail to respond. How should hindus respond? The effect of polygamy  &amp;ldquo;In other words, the more sister-wives a Mormon woman had, the fewer children she was likely to produce.&amp;rdquo; (G).   Some claim: “Religion will be a lot less important in the future (50 years from now)”.</description>

      <description>SOME INTERESTING ENCOUNTERS My plight was pretty serious after I left college. I was now a married man and the father of a son. There was a family to support which included my parents in die village. But I had not a penny in my pocket. I gave up the only job I could get as a clerk in the Central Secretariat after exactly 65 days because I was ashamed to be a cog in the British imperialist machine.</description>

      <description>I Friends,
I am really sorry for the members of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal who have so very kindly invited me to preside over this Conference. I am sure they will be asked many questions for having selected me as the President. The Mandal will be asked to explain as to why it has imported a man from Bombay to preside over a function which is held in Lahore. I believe the Mandal could easily have found some one better qualified than myself to preside on the occasion.</description>

IT has been said of Buddha that the sight, in quick succession, of disease, old age and death took away forever the smile from his lips and joy from his mind and thenceforth the Lord of Compassion devoted all his energies to the solution of the problem of misery.</description>

The Patron Saint of Indigenisation
&amp;ldquo;De Nobili, in fact,&amp;rdquo; observes Fr. Bede, &amp;ldquo;gives us the key to what was wrong in the Christian approach to the Hindu and shows how the gospel might have been presented to India in such a way as to attract its deepest minds and its most religious men.&amp;quot;1 He contrasts the way of De Nobili with that of St. Francis Xavier for whom &amp;ldquo;all Hindus, but especially Brahmins, were &amp;lsquo;devil-worshippers&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Although it would be hazardous at the present state of oriental research to state definitely the period when the foremost band of the intrepid Aryans made it their home and lighted their first sacrificial fire on the banks of the Sindhu, the Indus, yet certain it is that long before the ancient Egyptians, and Babylonians had built their magnificent civilization, the holy waters of the Indus were daily witnessing the lucid and curling columns of the scented sacrificial smokes and the valleys resounding with the chants of Vedic hymns- the spiritual fervour that animated their souls.</description>

In 1901 Vinayak passed his entrance examination In spite of his political preoccupations he never neglected his studies nor allowed his comrades to do that. So throughout his educational career he never failed. A large party arranged by the society and attended by several leading men of the city gave him a hearty send off on the eve of his leaving Nashik for Poona.</description>

DR. KESHAV BALIRAM HEDGEWAR, founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, was from his early boyhood intensely devoted to the cause of nation and was in the thick of the various movements going on at that time for the liberation of our motherland.</description>

      <description>Need for positive basis – Efforts of reactionary approach – Sangh for permanent organised life – Fate of temporary movements; Congress - Nation in drifting – The remedy – Red signal.
THE work of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had a very humble beginning. Steadily and gradually it has spread its work and today we find the Sangh branches working in full swing in all provinces of our country. This constant growth, this steady expansion has been an unfailing feature of the Sangh all through the trials and turmoils posed by the vagaries of the external situations.</description>

A huge locomotive has rushed on over the line and a small worm that was creeping upon one of the rails saved its life by crawling out of the path of the locomotive. Yet this little worm, so insignificant that it can be crushed in a moment, is a living something, while this locomotive, so huge, so immense, is only an engine, a machine. You say the one has life and the other is only dead matter and all its powers and strength and speed are only those of a dead machine, a mechanical contrivance.</description>

      <description>VEDIC RELIGIOUS IDEALS What concerns us most is the religious thought — on soul and God and all that appertains to religion. We will take the Samhitās. These are collections of hymns forming, as it were, the oldest Aryan literature, properly speaking, the oldest literature in the world. There may have been some scraps of literature of older date here and there, older than that even, but not books, or literature properly so called.</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY The Vedanta philosophy, as it is generally called at the present day, really comprises all the various sects that now exist in India. Thus there have been various interpretations, and to my mind they have been progressive, beginning with the dualistic or Dvaita and ending with the non-dualistic or Advaita. The word Vedanta literally means the end of the Vedas — the Vedas being the scriptures of the Hindus.</description>

A sage called Nārada went to another sage named Sanatkumāra to learn about truth, and Sanatkumara inquired what he had studied already. Narada answered that he had studied the Vedas, Astronomy, and various other things, yet he had got no satisfaction. Then there was a conversation between the two, in the course of which Sanatkumara remarked that all this knowledge of the Vedas, of Astronomy, and of Philosophy, was but secondary; sciences were but secondary.</description>

      <description>VEDANTA AS A FACTOR IN CIVILISATION (Extract from an address delivered at Airlie Lodge, Ridgeway Gardens, England)
People who are capable of seeing only the gross external aspect of things can perceive in the Indian nation only a conquered and suffering people, a race of dreamers and philosophers. They seem to be incapable of perceiving that in the spiritual realm India conquers the world. No doubt it is true that just as the too active Western mind would profit by an admixture of Eastern introspect ion and the meditative habit, so the Eastern would benefit by a somewhat greater activity and energy.</description>

 This leaves enough time to do something, assuming that &amp;quot;doing  something&amp;quot; is in principle possible and desirable. So, what are the options? It hardly makes sense to react to this demographic aggression with a Hindu demographic counter-offensive, as suggested by the Puri Shankaracharya, if at all it were possible to surpass the Muslim community in this respect.[1] A similar idea is that birth control should be made compulsory for all, e.</description>

      <description>4. THE HINDUS : A MAJORITY IN MORAL MINORITY
Here you have a huge majority of 850 million people, part of a culture which is thousands of years old. A culture which has proved over the ages its infinite tolerance towards other creeds and religions, giving refuge to all persecuted minorities in the world, whether Parsis, Syrian Christians, Jews, or Tibetans today. Yet Hindu-bashing has become a favorite pastime of the Press, both Indian and Foreign – and when you find someone such as Murli Manohar Joshi who wants to Indianize Indian education, an aspiration which would be found natural in any country, he is run down by his own people.</description>

 At the outset, I must acknowledge the truth in the objections raised by Dr. Shreerang Godbole. I also take this opportunity of expressing my deep respect and reverence about the work done by Voice of India for awakening Hindu scholars for the new outlook as well as for presenting them with the perceptions and facets of Hindutva which had remained elusive for centuries.
I firmly believe that the leadership of the RSS which has consented to this new step, do know these facts very well.</description>

TIPU SULTAN: AS KNOWN IN KERALA
RAVI VARMA
INTRODUCTION
Of late there has been a concerted attempt to distort and falsify recorded Indian history, very often even by painting dark periods of Indian history as glorious and progressive, to suit the selfish and perverted interests of the ruling clique. One of these attempts relates to the life and deeds of Tipu Sultan of Mysore. Most of his active life as Sultan of Mysore was spent in Kerala, waging wars of territorial annexation and Islamic conversions.</description>

Indo-European Encounter: An Indian Perspective
India and Europe1 originally came out in German in 1981. The English translation which was originally published by the State University of New York in 1988 has now been brought out in an Indian edition and made available to readers in India. The English translation is a much enlarged version of the original German edition and the Indian edition carries a special Preface by the author.</description>

Obligations of the State
According to Ruben Levy, &amp;ldquo;the functions which the lawyers and theorists lay down for the Caliphate, the duties of the ruler in Islam are four&amp;rdquo; - (1) Judgement (or justice), (2) Taxation, (3) Friday service and (4) Jihad.1 We shall take up Jihad first.
3.1. ISLAMIC WAR OR JIHAD
War against non-Muslims is called Jihad in Islamic scriptures. The first Jihads were fought in Arabia against the Pagans, Jews and Christians.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 4
Mission&amp;rsquo;s Volte-Face vis-a-vis Hindu Culture
The mission&amp;rsquo;s new-found love for Hindu culture is a sham. It is neither spontaneous nor sincere at any point. On the contrary, it remains forced, calculated and contrived throughout. Examined closely, it is no more than a thin veneer that cracks at the very first probe.
The language of Indigenisation indicates no change of heart on the mission&amp;rsquo;s part vis-a-vis Hindu culture. All that we learn, as we read between the lines, is that the mission is shifting its strategy in a changed situation.</description>

A PILGRIM TO THE SOVIET PARADISE
The first job is to find out how Pandit Nehru has looked at the Soviet Union and the creed of Communism all through these years. For purposes of this investigation we have chosen five basic books written by him, namely Soviet Russia (1929), Glimpses of World History (1934), An Autobiography (1936), Unity of India (1941), and Discovery of India (1946). All these books, except the first and the fourth, have been reprinted many times and still constitute the basic reading for anyone who wants to understand Pandit Nehru.</description>

Encounter in Malabar
It is not known whether the news of the Christian onslaught on Hinduism in the Roman Empire reached India. One wonders whether the merchants and monks who survived and returned home grasped the import of what was happening. If they gave to their countrymen an account of what they had witnessed in a distant land, the record has not survived or is not yet known. Nor do we know how the Hindus at home reacted, if at all.</description>

      <description>3. Legal definition of “Hindu”
3.1. Hindu law
India’s Constitution does not give a definition of the term Hindu, but it does define to whom the “Hindu Law” applies. It has to do this because in spite of its pretence to secularism, the Indian Constitution allows Muslims, Christians and Parsis a separate Personal Law. In a way, this separate treatment of different communities merely continues the communal autonomy of castes and sects accepted in pre-modern Hindu states, but it exposes the credibility deficit of Indian secularism.</description>

      <description>3. The Bodh Gaya temple controversy
When anti-Hindu lobbies unite, they often manage to get the contemporary form of Indian Buddhism on their side, viz. Ambedkarite neo-Buddhism. Because of its political background, the conversion of Scheduled Caste leader Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and many of his Mahar castemen to Buddhism (1956), in effect contributed to the genesis of what one might call Buddhist communalism.^(1) The anti-Hindu bias of Ambedkarite Buddhism was strengthened by the parallel Buddhist animus against Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka and Burma/Myanmar, as well as by the tendency among Nehruvian intellectuals to construe Buddhism historically as an anti-Hindu revolt.</description>

With their natural Hindu generosity, they want to keep assuring the non-Hindus that their places of worship are safe in Hindusthan.</description>

      <description>4
Hindu Spirituality Versus Monotheism
It is an intuition ingrained in the Hindu psyche to inhabit our entire environment - celestial, physical, vegetable, animal, and human - with innumerable Gods and Goddesses. Some of these divinities are installed in temples as icons, and worshipped with well-defined rituals. Some others are worshipped as and where they are invoked. Hindu shastras, saints and sages have paid homage to many Gods and Goddesses in many sublime hymns.</description>

      <description>4. The BJP flag
 A &amp;quot;Hindu&amp;quot; or non-Hindu party name would matter little if the  policies behind it would be the right ones, but as we shall demonstrate, the avoidance of a Hindu self‑designation goes hand in hand with the avoidance of certain pressing Hindu concerns in the party&amp;rsquo;s policies. While we are discussing the party&amp;rsquo;s self‑presentation, we may add to our doubts about the chosen name, the question of the party&amp;rsquo;s flag.</description>

      <description>4. The Residue of Macaulayism
Now for the second residue of British rule, Macaulayism. The term derives from Thomas Babington Macaulay, a member of the Governor General’s Council in the 1830s. Earlier, the British Government of India had completed a survey of the indigenous system of education in the Presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and Madras. A debate was going on whether the indigenous system should be retained or a new system introduced.</description>

But the conference itself was cancelled because Dr. Ambedkar&amp;rsquo;s address was found by the Reception Committee to be unacceptable. How far a Reception Committee is justified in rejecting a President of its choice because of his address that may be objectionable to it is open to question.</description>

Officers like Dalhousie are nothing more than mouthpieces of tyrany. They merely execute the commands of the &amp;lsquo;Home&amp;rsquo; authorities. To refer all responsibility for tyrannous misdeeds committed in India to such mouth-pieces would be as unjust as it is irrational. Dalhousie was purely a creature of the circumstances in which he was placed.</description>

It is not for laymen like us to discuss the correctness or otherwise of a High Court judgment. It should better be left to those who are conversant with the law and can enter into the intricacies of interpretation and logical construction. For all we know, it is perhaps impossible to impugn a book under the existing law, if it is assumed at the very outset that the book is a sacred scripture cherished as such by a certain community.</description>

Proselytization in Provincial
Muslim Kingdoms
A year before the dawn of the fifteenth century, Timur had claimed to have invaded Hindustan to destroy its infidels and idolators.¹ In the year 1400 India was predominantly Hindu; Muslims comprised less than 2 per cent of the population. The country south of the Krishna River right up to Cape Camorin formed the Vijayanagar empire and it was Hindu. On the west coast, the strip between Goa in the south to Chaul and (future) Bombay in the north was in the hands of independent Hindu rulers.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 5 - The History of Leftist Language Leftist language first came to India as the language of Communist imperialism. Its main spokesman was M.N. Roy. In his &amp;ldquo;India in Transition&amp;rdquo;, published in 1922, he laid down practically all fundamental formulations which, in due course, became the stock-in-trade of India&amp;rsquo;s Leftist parties. The language of these formulations is still the language of Leftism.
It will facilitate an understanding of Roy&amp;rsquo;s formulations if we summarise briefly the background of Indian nationalism as it had developed prior to that period.</description>

THE ORIGINS OF MUSLIM SLAVE SYSTEM
From the day India became a target of Muslim invaders its people began to be enslaved in droves to be sold in foreign lands or employed in various capacities on menial and not-so-menial jobs within the country. To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to go into the origins and development of the Islamic system of slavery. For, wherever the Muslims went, mostly as conquerors but also as traders, there developed a system of slavery peculiar to the clime, terrain and populace of the place.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
PERFIDY WINS WHERE VALOUR FAILED
The theologians of Islam had laid down, in the opening years of this imperialist ideology, that the kãfirs who could not be subdued by force should be subverted by fraud. The prophet of Islam had himself initiated the first lessons in this lore when he practised what came to be known as Siyãsat-i-Madînah in later times, that is, to take the kãfirs one by one and that too when they are least expecting an attack.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE BUSINESS OF BLAMING THE BRITISH
Problems have to be solved first at the level of thought before we can hope to solve them at the level of things. Hindu society has got to do some hard thinking in order to find an effective and lasting solution of the problem posed by Islam.
ISLAM AND HINDU SOCIETY
Islam came to India as a fully developed ideology of an aggressive and self-righteous imperialism.</description>

THE NATURE OF CONFLICT IN MEDIEVAL INDIA
Another guideline laid down by the NCERT for school-level textbooks of history exhorts that “no exaggeration of the role of religion in political conflicts is permitted”.
Let us for the time being forget the fiat of the State as to what is permitted and what is forbidden while writing the new textbooks of history. Let us first find out the facts as recorded by medieval historians, and review the various interpretations of those facts.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THREE
MUSLIM RESPONSE TO HINDU PROTECTION
The protection provided by Siddharãja JayasiMha to Muslims and their places of worship was continued by his successors in Gujarat. The population of Muslims as well as their places of worship continued to multiply in several cities of Gujarat as is borne out by numerous inscriptions, particularly from Khambat, Junagadh and Prabhas Patan, dated before Gujarat passed under Muslim rule in the aftermath of Ulugh Khãn’s invasion in AD 1299.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER THREE
PSYCHOLOGY OF JESUS
3.1. Nietzsche on Jesus
The first to take on Jesus as a psychologist, though not as a medically trained psychopathologist, was the German scholar and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the greatest critics of Christianity (who ended up suffering an irreversible mental breakdown himself).^(1) Like many Christians, he thought that the historical Christ was a very different man from the Christ of theology. Thus, Christ had renounced the law and chosen a life of childlike innocence, whereas the Churches had built an elaborate system of morality on top of his teachings.</description>

Some Historical Questions
Sita Ram Goel
Why did Islamic invaders continue to destroy Hindu temples and desecrate the idols of Hindu Gods and Goddesses throughout the period of their domination? Why did they raise mosques on sites occupied earlier by Hindu places of worship? These questions were asked by Hindu scholars in modern times after the terror of Islam had ceased and could no more seal their lips.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWO - NEGATIONISM IN INDIA The negationism regarding the Nazi crimes has been the object of much public discussion. Turkish negationism about the Armenian genocide has received some attention. Less well-known is that India has its own brand of negationism.
Since about 1920 an effort has been going on in India to rewrite history and to deny the millennium-long attack of Islam on Hinduism. Today, most politicians and English- writing intellectuals in India will go out of their way to condemn any public reference to this long and painful conflict in the strongest terms.</description>

In politically fallen, socially degraded and financially ruined Hindusthan, the eighteen-eighties and nineties witnessed the darkest period in the history of our country. The first peep of the dawn in the form of the refonns of 1909 was still to come. The dawn of 1919 was beyond the horizon. The spiritual planets like Maharshi Ranade, Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda were kindling light of social regeneration and spiritual heritage.</description>

      <description>CLOSE TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY I saw quite a bit of the Great Calcutta Killing of August 16-17, 1946 with my own eyes. There were a large number of dead bodies lying on the streets. There were many more floating down the Hooghly. I saw an extensive destruction of private and public property by fire as well as by mob fury. The death and desolation all around moved me to despair about human nature itself.</description>

      <description>WHEN the third chief commander of the English army before Delhi became hopeless of taking the town and resigned, Brigadier-General Wilson replaced him. At that time, in the camp of the English army maddened by the attacks of the Revolutionaries, it was seriously discussed, in despair, whether the siege should be raised. It is difficult to say what would have been the course of the Revolution of 1857 if this plan had been resolved upon.</description>

      <description>Introduction
Jihãd is one of the basic doctrines of Islam, but the average Indian’s knowledge of it is both superficial and unsatisfactory. Hindus usually render the term as dharmayuddha, but this rendering is totally misleading. Dharmayuddha means ‘war fought according to rules laid down in the Dharmashãstras’ such as not attacking a person who does not have a weapon or has dropped it, not molesting an adversary who has surrendered, not pursuing a defeated enemy who has run away, not attacking the non-combatants in the enemy camp, not harming the women and holy people and places in the enemy’s territory, etc.</description>

1929-1938
(At the end of 1926, Sri Aurobindo withdrew completely, leaving the material responsibility of the disciples and the growing Ashram to Mother. Apart from three and later four yearly “darshans,” Sri Aurobindo kept in external touch with the disciples through letters—thousands of letters in which he tirelessly dealt with their questions or difficulties or revolts.
This section consists mostly of excerpts from some of Sri Aurobindo&amp;rsquo;s letters.)

      <description>So far we have been treading on solid ground of recorded facts, but now we cannot refrain ourselves from making an occasional excursion into the borderland of conjecture. So far we have not pinned our faith to any theory about the original home of the Aryans. But if the most widely accepted theory of their entrance into India be relied on, then a natural curiousity arises as to the origin of the names by which they called the new scenes of their adopted home.</description>

The Christian missionary orchestra in India after independence has continued to rise from one crescendo to another with the applause of the Nehruvian establishment manned by a brood of self-alienated Hindus spawned by missionary-macaulayite education. The only rift in the lute has been K.M. Panikkar’s Asia and Western Dominance published in 1953, the Report of the Christian Missionary Activities Committee Madhya Pradesh published in 1956, Om Prakash Tyagi’s Bill on Freedom of Religion introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1978, Arun Shourie’s Missionaries in India published in 1994 and the Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill introduced in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, M.</description>

Much thought was devoted to the subject before the name &amp;lsquo;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&amp;rsquo; was decided upon for the organisation. A number of persons close to the Sangh were also consulted. Naturally, many suggestions were put forth, and objections raised against each name.

It goes without saying that the teachers are the key figures in the field of education. It is but proper that we briefly touch upon a few fundamentals in this context.
Our Basic Concept
To start with, what does ‘education’ connote in the modern sense of the term?</description>

      <description>VEDANTA AND PRIVILEGE (Delivered in London)
We have nearly finished the metaphysical portion of the Advaita. One point, and perhaps the most difficult to understand, remains. We have seen so far that, according to the Advaita theory, all we see around us, and the whole universe in fact, is the evolution of that one Absolute. This is called, in Sanskrit, Brahman. The Absolute has become changed into the whole of nature.</description>

      <description>PRIVILEGE (Delivered at the Sesame Club, London)
Two forces seem to be working throughout nature. One of these is constantly differentiating, and the other is as constantly unifying; the one making more and more for separate individuals, the other, as it were, bringing the individuals into a mass, bringing out sameness in the midst of all this differentiation. It seems that the action of these two forces enters into every department of nature and of human life.</description>

This is a story from one of the books of India, called &amp;ldquo;Lives of Saints&amp;rdquo;. There was a young man, a Brahmin by birth, in a certain village. The man fell in love with a bad woman in another village. There was a big river between the two villages, and this man, every day, used to go to that girl, crossing this river in a ferry boat.</description>

      <description>Appendix (1998, but not included in the book The Demographic Siege):
Using Kafir women in the service of Muslim demography
 One of the most painful aspects of Muslim demographic warfare is  the open attempt by Muslims to grab non-Muslim girls to use them for their own demographic ambitions, meanwhile also inflicting a good dose of humiliation on the accursed kafirs. In Bangladesh and in Muslim-majority areas inside India, this often takes the form of simply kidnapping girls, or of threatening their families to marry them out to Muslims.</description>

Indian journalists must be held responsible in some degree for the slow progresses India has made in regaining her self-confidence, shattered by centuries of colonization. For Indian journalists are often the worst enemies of India and Indian culture, constantly harping at the negative sides of India, constantly ignoring the greatness of this country. They must also be the biggest Hindu-bashers in a nation where there are already so many Hindu bashers (Marxists, Muslims, Christians, politicians), having since Independence, made fun in the most belittling manner of Hindu culture.</description>

The Mappilas had not dared to disobey their Hindu Rajas before the advent of Mysore Sultans with their Islamic brutalities in Kerala.</description>

Development in Huxley&amp;rsquo;s Thought: Hindu-Buddhist Influences
Hinduism-Buddhism has been making a great impact on the West&amp;rsquo;s religious thinking. C.E.M. Joad even called it a &amp;ldquo;counter-attack from the East&amp;rdquo;. This is a kind of impact however which cannot be measured in terms of &amp;ldquo;converts&amp;rdquo;. The influence remains even unacknowledged. But it works nonetheless unconsciously and at a deeper level. &amp;ldquo;Karma&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yoga&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Consciousness&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Meditation&amp;rdquo; and other such intimately Indian concepts are very much current.</description>

Income of the State
One of the main functions of the state was collection of taxes. No scheme of conquest or defence or administration was possible without regular inflow of revenue. Muslim jurists divide the revenue of a Muslim state into two categories - religious and secular. The principal religious tax was Zakat and it was collected from the Muslims only. The secular taxes comprised Khams, Jiziyah and Kharaj; these were levied on the non-Muslims.</description>

The second edition which was &amp;ldquo;revised and, to a considerable extent, rewritten&amp;rdquo;, carried a foreword from Krishna Menon who was mainly responsible for getting it published in England. Krishna Menon says: &amp;ldquo;Glimpses of World History is no mere narrative of events, valuable as the work is in this respect, but also a reflection of the author&amp;rsquo;s personality.</description>

Jihãd in the Koran
The Koran does not discuss a single Islamic tenet systematically and in conformity with the arrangement of its chapters. The combined body of Revelations from Allah which constitute the Holy Book of Islam appeared to the Prophet without any logical sequence during the 23 years of his prophetic career (609 to 632 AD), and this fact accounts for its haphazard arrangement. The Koran has 114 chapters and some six thousand verses.</description>

Hallucinations of the Devil’s Devotees
For a long time, the Syrian Christians provided the only contact which Hinduism had with Christianity. India lost touch with the Christian West for well-nigh seven centuries because Islamic empires in the Middle East and Central Asia, had raised a barrier between the two. Christians and Muslims were involved in mortal combat soon after the death of prophet Muhammad in AD 632. Christian travellers ran the risk of death if they tried to come east through Muslim dominated routes on land and sea.</description>

4.1. Claims of Hindu iconoclasm
Whenever the history of the many thousands of temple destructions by Muslims is discussed, the secularists invariably come up with the claim that Hindus have done much the same thing to Buddhists, Jains and Animists. In particular, the disappearance of Buddhism from India is frequently explained as the result of “Brahminical onslaught”. Though extremely widespread by now, this allegation is entirely untrue.</description>

The term was coined by the Freedom Fighter and later HMS president V. D. Savarkar as the title of his book Hindutva, written in prison and clandestinely published in 1924.</description>

The Basis of Universal Spirituality
Sri Ramakrishna was one day taunted by a sceptic that the Kali he worshipped at Dakshineshwar was only a slab of black stone carved into a bizarre female figure and decked with glittering trinkets. The saint was taken aback. So far he had not cared to see the sacred icon in its supreme spiritual splendour. He had been content to witness the Divine Mother in all Her majesty in the cave of his heart whenever he was in a state of samãdhi.</description>

It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will be bought over, in due course, by some other power or powers hostile to positive Indian nationalism.

      <description>Aurangzeb was himself mistaken in sounding the death of Mararashtra Dharma and the vitality it had breathed into the movement of Hindu Revival in Maharashtra. Like so many other movements, personal or parochial, he thought the Maratha movement too must have received its death-blow at the death of its able leader Shivaji and by the fact of his being succeeded by his brave but incapable son Sambhaji; so Aurangzeb thought h is opportunity had come.</description>

      <description> Bishnois don&amp;rsquo;t cut down trees or kill animals (PJ, FV), they don&amp;rsquo;t let in outsiders into their villages (especially muslims). They have high TFR (anecdotes).  This can be contrasted by some brahmanas selling agrahara lands to muslims for money in TN (who overpay to get a foothold - via ravilochanan).   sindhi and gujarAti traders are spread through out the world.  </description>

      <description>To allow the existance of a slavery under which such unjust acts of oppression (as have been mentioned in the last chapter) and hundreds of other unmentionable crimes (which have been left unmentioned, being, indeed, too numerous to mention) are committed and encouraged and to bow the head in submission to the perpetrators thereof, is not this the very destruction of Religion ? What religion is there which has not condemned dependence and slavery?</description>

      <description>JUST as the tremendous shock was shaking the whole of North- Western India, towards Umballa and the Panjab, so also in the South, another part of the country was trembling through another of its waves. In the town of Aligarh, below Delhi, there was the regiment called the &amp;ldquo;9th Native Infantry.&amp;rdquo; Some detachments of this regiment were stationed at Minpur, Itawa, and Boland. The Government had such confidence in this regiment, that they thought that it would never revolt even though all the Sepoys in India should rise against them.</description>

      <description>I I appreciate greatly the honour done me by the Mahatma in taking notice in his Harijan of the speech on Caste which I had prepared for the Jat Pat Todak Mandal. From a perusal of his review of my speech it is clear that the Mahatma completely dissents from the views I have expressed on the subject of Caste. I am not in the habit of entering into controversy with my opponents unless there are special reasons which compel me to act otherwise.</description>

IT does not seem right to regard the students as community different from the rest of the society. The qualities of the people in general manifest in the younger folk, that only due to the immaturity, inexperience and preponderance of emotions in them; such qualities manifest themselves as an uncontrolled outburst.</description>

He has gone further and chosen to repeat the etymological exercise which we find in most of the books written by apologists of Islam in modem times.</description>

Proselytization in Provincial
Muslim Kingdoms
A year before the dawn of the fifteenth century, Timur had claimed to have invaded Hindustan to destroy its infidels and idolators.¹ In the year 1400 India was predominantly Hindu; Muslims comprised less than 2 per cent of the population. The country south of the Krishna River right up to Cape Camorin formed the Vijayanagar empire and it was Hindu. On the west coast, the strip between Goa in the south to Chaul and (future) Bombay in the north was in the hands of independent Hindu rulers.</description>

The pride of place in this context goes, of course, to the &amp;ldquo;ashram&amp;rdquo; of Robert De Nobili and his successors at Madurai. We have already dealt with it in detail.</description>

Instead they published a Draft Plam of Action in December, 1930 characterising the Congress as a &amp;ldquo;class organisation of the capitalists working against the fundamental interests of the toiling masses.</description>

In the Name of Religion
Sita Ram Goel
We shall now take up the explanation provided by the theology of Islam derived from the Quran and the Hadis.
Ibn Ishaq, the first biographer of the Prophet, devotes many pages to a description of Arab polytheism at the time when Islam started taking shape. Every Arab household, he tells us, had an idol of some God or Goddess. He also gives the names of many idols which were housed in sanctuaries maintained by different tribes across the Arab peninsula.</description>

REACTIONS TO PSYCHO-CHRISTOLOGY
4.1. Catholic reactions
In Flanders, the Catholic-dominated press has kept very quiet about Dr. Somers’ approach to Jesus. Most theologians have kept mum. The Vatican has not reacted. It had put some Jesuits to work on this theory, but they did not publicly speak out. Perhaps they are aware of its explosive potential. Perhaps they are, on the contrary, not worried at all, because earlier psychopathological studies about Jesus had also not toppled Christianity.</description>

ENSLAVEMENT OF HINDUS BY ARAB AND
TURKISH INVADERS
Turks were not the first Muslims to invade India. Prior to the coming of Turks the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim invaded Sindh in the early years of the eighth century. In conformity with the Muslim tradition, the Arabs captured and enslaved Indians in large numbers. Indeed from the days of Muhammad bin Qasim in the eighth century to those of Ahmad Shah Abdali in the eighteenth, enslavement, distribution, and sale of Hindu prisoners was systematically practised by Muslim invaders and rulers of India.</description>

In 1988, the schools in the Soviet Union decided to suspend the history exams because &amp;ldquo;the history books are full of lies anyway&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
ISLAM WAS THE CULPRIT
The Aligarh apologists accuse the medieval Muslim historians of exaggerating the barbarities committed by the Muslim invaders and rulers. Next, they blame on the inherent barbarism of the Turks whatever irreducible minimum of atrocities cannot be hushed out of recorded history. And they end by absolving Islam of every crime committed in its name.
My first question is: How is it that what the Prophet of Islam did in Arabia and the Arab armies in Syria, Iraq, Iran, North Africa, Sicily, Spain and Sindh, bears such close resemblance to what the Turks did in India?</description>

THE FRUSTRATION OF ISLAM IN INDIA
Long ago, some 12 or 13 years before Partition, I had a chance to pass by a meeting of Muslims in Delhi. The chaste Urdu and the weighty voice of the man making the speech at the moment, made me stand and stare. It was a bearded mullah wearing a fez. He was narrating some history which was new for me.
The mullah mentioned several dates on which some decisive battles had been fought and won by the armies of Islam.</description>

THE LESSONS WE HAVE TO LEARN
Dr. Misra’s monograph is pertinent not only to a past period of Indian history but also to our situation at present. The lessons which this learned study draws for us can be ignored by us only at our own peril.
Firstly, it highlights Hindu heroism in the face of an inveterate Islamic imperialism. Such heroism has seldom been seen in the annals of any other people.</description>

      <description>The activities of so intrepid a people as the Sindhus or Hindus could no longer be kept cooped or cabined within the narrow compass of the Panchanad or the Punjab. The vast and fertile plains farther off stood out inviting the efforts of some strong and vigorous race. Tribe after tribe of the Hindus issued forth form the land of their nursery and led by the consciousness of a great mission and their Sacrificial Fire that was the symbol thereof, they soon reclaimed the vast, waste and but very thinly populated lands.</description>

1938-1940
(In the night of November 23-24, 1938, Sri Aurobindo fell down while walking in concentration and broke his right leg. In the years that followed, a small group of disciples, mostly attendants and physicians, met him every day. Two of them recorded the informal talks that ensued, which often touched on the Indian political scene, the rising threat of Nazism, and then World War II which Sri Aurobindo followed closely.</description>

      <description>ON the day on which the Revolutionaries were successful in the battle of Chinhat, the English power in Oudh came to an end and the revolt had openly assumed the form of a national Revolution. The Sepoys, princes, and people began by establishing a ruler liked by them on the vacant throne of Lucknow. The anarchy which raged everywhere for the space of a week after the battle of Chinhat had to be first suppressed before preparations for war could be made.</description>

      <description>An overwhelming majority of muslims declared their unwillingness to live in a hindu majority democracy and ushered in the partition. Alas, a significant fraction of them stayed back anyway to form an inimical fifth column sympathetic to Pakistan.  In the 1946 provincial assembly elections, the Muslim League captured 4.5 million of about 6 million Muslim votes. So, 75% of Indian Muslims voted for the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan.</description>

      <description>RAM SWARUP TO THE RESCUE I was present in the Second Party Conference of the Communist Party of India which was held in the Maidan at Calcutta in February, 1948. It was some time before this Conference that B. T. Ranadive had taken over from P.C. Joshi the General Secretaryship of the CPI. The Ranadive line, as it came to be known in India, was an adoption of the international Communist line laid down by Stalin through the mouth of his minion, Zhdanov, in September 1947.</description>

      <description>This can happen as government policy or as a matter of riots. Summary: Muhammad&amp;rsquo;s example as *the ideal muslim* has motivated murderers and pillagers throughout the ages, including in my country. Like early christians who burnt down the library of Alexandria, they destroyed the great universities of naLandA and vikramashIlA, the temples they razed are too numerous to count - zarathruShTa&amp;rsquo;s favorite tree, the sphynxes nose, tombs of Timbuktu, buddha-s of bAmiyAn being well known examples in the wider world.</description>

Savarkar passed his Mati’iculation Examinatiou in Decem- ber 1901, and left Nasik for Poona in January 1902. What was the state of Poona ? Exactly a year before Poona had lost Mahadeo Govind Ranade, India’s foremost torchbearer of learning and light. Ranade was a great social reformer, a towering scholar, an ardent patriot, a renowned thinker, an eminent economist and an exemplary judge. He was the foremost torchbearer of a new age, and wished to build a social structure conforming to the demands of fresh ideas.</description>

      <description>Revival, not reaction- Culture, indefinable yet all-absorbing- Nation as God- True spirit of service- Not rights but duty- Unity in diversity- To raise the average- Present perversions- Watering roots of immortality
Our concept of Hindu Nation is not a mere bundle of political and economic rights. It is essentially cultural. Our ancient and sublime cultural values of life form its life-breath. And it is only an intense rejuvenation of the spirit of our culture that can give us the true vision of our national life, and a fruitful direction to all our efforts in solving the innumerable problems confronting our nation today.</description>

We are witnessing a strange phenomenon in our country today. The real and positive concept of Hindu Nationalism is being dubbed as communal, reactionary, narrow-minded and so on and the unscientific, reactionary and harmful theory of territorial nationalism, upheld by our present-day leaders, is paraded as &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;broad- minded&amp;rsquo;.</description>

He was a great man from whom I learnt it, and his own life was a practical demonstration of this great principle I have been always learning great lessons from that one principle, and it appears to me that all the secret of success is there; to pay as much attention to the means as to the end.</description>

With the exception of the Buddhist and the Jain, perhaps all the religions of the world have the idea of a Personal God, and with it comes the idea of devotion and worship. The Buddhists and the Jains, although they have no Personal God, worship the founders of their religions in precisely the same way as others worship a Personal God.</description>

THE NECESSITY OF RELIGION (Delivered in London)
Of all the forces that have worked and are still working to mould the destinies of the human race, none, certainly, is more potent than that, the manifestation of which we call religion. All social organisations have as a background, somewhere, the workings of that peculiar force, and the greatest cohesive impulse ever brought into play amongst human units has been derived from this power.</description>

MAYA AND ILLUSION (Delivered in London)
Almost all of you have heard of the word Māyā. Generally it is used, though incorrectly, to denote illusion, or delusion, or some such thing. But the theory of Maya forms one of the pillars upon which the Vedanta rests; it is, therefore, necessary that it should be properly understood. I ask a little patience of you, for there is a great danger of its being misunderstood.</description>

MAYA AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPTION OF GOD (Delivered in London, 20th October 1896)
We have seen how the idea of Māyā, which forms, as it were, one of the basic doctrines of the Advaita Vedanta, is, in its germs, found even in the Samhitās, and that in reality all the ideas which are developed in the Upanishads are to be found already in the Samhitas in some form or other.</description>

MAYA AND FREEDOM (Delivered in London, 22nd October 1896)
&amp;ldquo;Trailing clouds of glory we come,&amp;rdquo; says the poet. Not all of us come as trailing clouds of glory however; some of us come as trailing black fogs; there can be no question about that. But every one of us comes into this world to fight, as on a battlefield. We come here weeping to fight our way, as well as we can, and to make a path for ourselves through this infinite ocean of life; forward we go, having long ages behind us and an immense expanse beyond.</description>

India is surrounded mostly by unfriendly neighbors. We see either Islamic countries promoting a rabid anti-Hindu policy, such as Afghanistan or Pakistan; or small inconsequent nations such as Nepal, which owe so much to India, yet often harbor India’s enemies, as shown by the Indian Airlines hijack of December 1999. Further East, we find Japan, which has a sad hegemonic history, but was one of the most vociferous nations against India after Pokhran II</description>

No newspaper or periodical worth its name in India will publish what I write in the lines that follow. Not because the subject matter is seditious or sacrilegious or obscene, or even controversial, but simply because it defies the Emergency imposed on this country by Muslim theologians and politicians backed by &amp;lsquo;secularist&amp;rsquo; intellectuals and politicians and riotous Muslim mobs and plain terrorists.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 2
NEDUMKOTTA: TRAVANCORE DEFENCE FORTIFICATION
The Nedumkotta was a defence fortification constructed along the northern borders of the erstwhile Travancore State. It passed through the territories of the then Cochin State.
The Nedumkotta was built primarily to resist the invasion under Hyder Ali Khan against Travancore State. It was raised mainly with clay and mud, and reinforced with stones, laterite and granite at strategic places. It started from the Krishan Kotta on the west coast, above Kodungallur, and stretched upto the Annamalai Hills on the Western Ghats.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6
The Hindu View of Education
A nation&amp;rsquo;s theories about education depend upon its theories about man. Its definition and understanding of education depend upon its definition and understanding of man.
If we regard man as a physical entity, our approach to education would be of one kind; if we regard man as a mental being, our approach would be of a different kind. But if we regard man as a spiritual being, our educational formulations are bound to be different.</description>

      <description>3. Deep Chandra Awasthi
 At the very outset I would like to say that the eight formulations popularised by Sangh Parivar in recent years as stated, is not the whole fact. There may be even some more such formulations put forth by individuals as social hypothesis yet to be put to tests before being accepted as useful practices. The most that can be said is that the Sangh Parivar may also be in a mood to carry out some such tests.</description>

      <description>FOUR
AN INDEFATIGABLE SOVIET ENTHUSIAST
We have seen in the foregoing chapter that Pandit Nehru held up the &amp;ldquo;Soviet experiment&amp;rdquo; up to 1934 as being of special interest to India because-in his opinion &amp;ldquo;conditions in this country [India] are very much the same as in Russia before the Revolution&amp;rdquo;. What were the similarities? First of all, Russia before the Revolution was a backward country as India was in 1934. Secondly, Russia before the Revolution had a huge language and minorities problem, the same as we had in India in 1934.</description>

Expenditure of the State
The income of the state was expended on various branches of government and administration, on the harems of kings and nobles, and on forts, palaces, mosques and tombs. Large amounts were sent abroad to Muslim holy places like Mecca and Medina and for the Caliphs. At home, men of letters and men of religion were given handsome awards and grants, pensions and lump sum amounts. Salaries and scholarships were given to students and mendicants.</description>

Jihãd in the Hadis
Before I discuss the contents of the Hadis literature, in so far as those pertain to jihãd, I must tell the reader that only Sunni works of Hadis have been published in translation and even those translations are partial. The Koran is canonical scripture par excellence, and is common to all sections of Muslims. But the Hadis of the Sunnis is not the same as the Hadis of the Shias.</description>

Pirates in Priest’s Clothing
The next encounter between Hinduism and Christianity commenced with the coming of Christian missionaries to Malabar after Vasco da Gama found his way to Calicut in AD 1498. It took a serious turn in AD 1542 when Francis Xavier, a rapacious pirate dressed up as a priest, arrived on the scene. The proceedings have been preserved by the Christian participants. They make the most painful reading in the history of Christianity in India.</description>

      <description>5. Vandalism sanctified by scripture
(After Hindu activists demolished a mosque in a small town in Rajasthan, the on-line magazine “OutlookIndia” published a comment with an entirely predictable message by the well-known secularist Yoginder Sikand. At the editor’s invitation, I wrote the following rebuttal, published on 31 August 2001.)
In his article “Sanctified Vandalism As A Political Tool” (www.OutLooklndia.com, Aug. 23, 2001), Yoginder Sikand tries to explain away Muslim iconoclasm as marginal and uncharacteristic, all while accusing “the Hindus and others” of just such iconoclasm.</description>

      <description>5. “Semitization”, of Hinduism
5.1. The “Semitic religions”
At the height of the Ayodhya controversy, many secularists suddenly set themselves up as teachers of Hinduism, of “real Hinduism” as opposed to the “distorted” Hinduism of the Hindu Nationalists.^(1) This was a crucial step forward for the Hindu cause, for it meant that Hinduism was replacing secularism as the norm. The secularists told the Hindu activists that Hinduism is alright, only, it is something altogether different from what you think it is.</description>

The astrologers who had chosen the time, had clearly picked a very auspicious stellar configuration, for on the very same day, the Berlin wall was broken. Jay Dubashi wrote : &amp;ldquo;While a temple was going up in Ayodhya, a Communist temple was being demolished five thousand miles away in Europe&amp;rdquo; If this is not history, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.</description>

Revival of Universal Spirituality
The Hindu and Buddhist Gods and Goddesses in India, Nepal, Bali, Burma, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and elsewhere are only local expressions of a universal spirituality. In this respect, spirituality is akin to science. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics reveal the same secrets of Nature to all men everywhere and at all times, no matter in what language those secrets are couched or communicated.</description>

      <description>6. Sangh Parivar, the last Gandhians
 When in 1980, the secularist tendency led by Nana Deshmukh and  Atal Behari Vajpayee imposed &amp;ldquo;Gandhian socialism&amp;rdquo; on the newly founded BJP as its official ideology, all the establishment secularists laughed at this transparent attempt to acquire a new secular identity.[1] &amp;ldquo;This party is neither Gandhian nor socialist&amp;rdquo;, they said. The party was in fact more socialist than it would like to admit after liberalization became the new orthodoxy, certainly more socialist than the non-socialist &amp;ldquo;cleverest bourgeois scoundrel&amp;rdquo; Gandhi ever was, but we can agree that it was less socialist than was normative in 1980.</description>

In this concluding survey we shall take up the United Front which these ideologies, particularly Islamism and Communism, have forged to malign Hindu society and keep it on the defensive.</description>

The business of life can go on very well without an ideological frame of reference. One eats and mates and sleeps and makes a living. One reads books and papers and gossips and goes about passing conventional judgments on current events, One has a family, a profession, a circle of friends, and some hobby to keep one occupied in leisure time.</description>

Growth under the Mughals
By the time Akbar the Great (1556-1605) embarked upon the policy of reuniting these kingdom under his imperial banner, Muslim population was rising all over the country. Still, despite all the exertion of the Muslims at proselytization, Hindu resistance to it was also admirably effective. Sind and Punjab no doubt had a sizeable Muslim population. But at the beginning of the sixteenth century, northern Sind (north of the River Indus) had, according to Portuguese accounts, a local Hindu as its ruler or governor.</description>

[A Jew from Syria had migrated to Medina some years before Muhammad proclaimed his prophethood in 610 CE.]
Later when he knew that he was about to die he said, “O Jews, what do you think made me leave a land of bread and wine to come to a land of hardship and hunger?” When we [the Jews] said that we could not think why, he said that he had come to this country expecting to see the emergence of a prophet whose time was at hand.</description>

Similarly, in his articles “The Tip of An Iceberg” and “In the Name of Religion” (February 9, May 21) Sita Ram Goel brings to the subject unequalled research and discusses it in a larger historical perspective.</description>

SPREADING THE BIG LIE
According to the Marxist professors “what is really required is an investigation into the theory that both the Dera Keshav Rai temple and the Idgah were built on the site of a Buddhist monastery which appears to have been destroyed.” Thank God, they have suggested it only as a theory; elsewhere in their writings they have not been that cautious. In fact, they have gone out of their way in spreading the Big Lie that the Hindus destroyed many Buddhist and Jain temples and monasteries in the pre-Islamic past.</description>

SLAVE SULTANS OF HINDUSTAN
Slavery was wide-spread in Islam. The early Turkish invaders and rulers of India were slaves or scions of slaves. Mahmud of Ghazni was the son of a purchased slave, Subuktigin. Subuktigin in his turn had been bought by one Alptigin who himself was a purchased slave. Alptigin was the first Turkish slave-warrior-ruler who carried his arms into Hindustan. His career and resourcefulness are symbolic of the Turkish slaves as a whole.</description>

“He stayed for a good time in Medina,” writes Jablani, “and returned to Mecca in 1731, a little before the start of the Hajj season. Of course, he spent the whole month of Ramzan there and its last ten days in seclusion (itikat) in the sacred Mosque. During those hours of seclusion many secret truths were made clear to him and he was duly apprised of some difficult problems.</description>

THE MAGNITUDE OF MUSLIM ATROCITIES - I
The world famous historian, Will Durant has written in his Story of Civilisation that “the Mohammedan conquest of India was probably the bloodiest story in history”.
India before the advent of Islamic imperialism was not exactly a zone of peace. There were plenty of wars fought by Hindu princes. But in all their wars, the Hindus had observed some time-honoured conventions sanctioned by the Šãstras.</description>

THE NATURE OF NATIONAL FRONTIERS
At times and in certain situations, the frontiers of a nation are not merely physical; they are also ideological. We shall never be able to overcome our predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan unless we understand her ideological frontiers and define our own.
Compared to us Pakistan is much smaller in size and population. She is much poorer in industrial infrastructure and other resources. Yet she has attacked us not once but three times in the short span of 24 years.</description>

Early 1940
 At present mankind is undergoing an evolutionary crisis in which  is concealed a choice of its destiny&amp;hellip;. Man has created a system of civilisation which has become too big for his limited mental capacity and understanding and his still more limited spiritual and moral capacity to utilise and manage, a too dangerous servant of his blundering ego and its appetites&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>It is then inevitable that we must resist sword in hand and wage a relentless struggle to win back our political independence and to safeguard the honour of the ashes of our fathers and the temples of our gods. We must hence hasten first to propitiate the God of War, the Lord of Hosts, even as Indrajit did before he marched on to the battlefield, as the &amp;lsquo;Puranas&amp;rsquo; tell us, to secure the unconquerable Chariot which he expected to appear forth out of the blazing Sacrificial Fire.</description>

      <description>MARCH, 1947.
BLITZ ON THE HINDU AND SIKH MINORITIES
As has been told above, there was a complete concert between the Muslim League and the Muslim masses which followed its programme and policy on the one hand, and Muslim officials and police on the other. The British bureaucracy which still held supreme power, was perhaps inclined to favour the Muslim League-not as such, but as the one force in the country which could be relied upon to pursue a policy of dissension and strife, and thus create in the country such a mood as would make a politically united India, at least a politically united Punjab, impossible So in this background came the fruition and consummation of the Muslim League plan to dominate the Punjab, to form in this Province its ministry, which with the consent of Hindus and Sikhs could not be done, but which might be established after beating them down.</description>

He said a particular thing becomes mandatory for M in reaction to any initiative that dilutes the full limits of Sharia.</description>

The terms Aryawarta or Bramhawarta were not so suitable as to express the vast synthesis that embraced the whole continent from the Indus to the sea and aimed to weld it into a nation. Aryawarta as defined by the ancient writers was the land that lay between the Himalayas and the Vindhya.</description>

The year 1906 was a landmark in Indian politics. During this year Savarkar, the leader of the Abhinava Bharat, went to London. That year saw the birth of the Muslim League at Dacca. The formation of Barindranath’s revolutionai&amp;rsquo;y party at Maniktola, a suburb of Calcutta, and the foundation of the revolutionary institution, the Anushilan Samiti, took place during the same year.
With a band of a few hundred youths at his command in Maharashtra, Savarkar left India.</description>

      <description>BAREILLY was the capital of the province of Rohilkhand. The English had wrested the kingdom away from the Rohilla Pathans who had been ruling the province. There was a population there of brave, strong, and spirited Mussulmans, biding their time to take revenge for this insult. Rohilkhand and its capital must also be counted among the places where the Revolutionary propaganda against English rule was spreading fast about the year 1857.</description>

It was represented to Government from time to time that the conversion of illiterate aboriginals and other backward people was effected by the Christian Missionaries either forcibly or through fraud or temptations of monetary gain, and the Government were informed that the feelings of non-Christians were being offended by conversions brought about by such methods.</description>

The answer to the so-called problem of &amp;lsquo;religious minorities&amp;rsquo; can be found only in the historically correct, rational and positive approach of Hindu Rashtra. Otherwise, the so- called minorities are bound to become more and more hardened in their separate shells of religion and turn into a dreadful source of disruption of our body-politic.</description>

THE ABSOLUTE AND MANIFESTATION (Delivered in London, 1896)
The one question that is most difficult to grasp in understanding the Advaita philosophy, and the one question that will be asked again and again and that will always remain is: How has the Infinite, the Absolute, become the finite? I will now take up this question, and, in order to illustrate it, I will use a figure. Here is the Absolute (a), and this is the universe (b).</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
GOD IN EVERYTHING (Delivered in London, 27th October 1896)
We have seen how the greater portion of our life must of necessity be filled with evils, however we may resist, and that this mass of evil is practically almost infinite for us. We have been struggling to remedy this since the beginning of time, yet everything remains very much the same. The more we discover remedies, the more we find ourselves beset by subtler evils.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
REALISATION (Delivered in London, 29th October 1896)
I will read to you from one of the Upanishads. It is called the Katha Upanishad. Some of you, perhaps, have read the translation by Sir Edwin Arnold, called the Secret of Death. In our last [i.e. a previous] lecture we saw how the inquiry which started with the origin of the world, and the creation of the universe, failed to obtain a satisfactory answer from without, and how it then turned inwards.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
UNITY IN DIVERSITY (Delivered in London, 3rd November 1896)
&amp;ldquo;The Self-existent One projected the senses outwards and, therefore, a man looks outward, not within himself. A certain wise one, desiring immortality, with inverted senses, perceived the Self within.&amp;rdquo; As I have already said, the first inquiry that we find in the Vedas was concerning outward things, and then a new idea came that the reality of things is not to be found in the external world; not by looking outwards, but by turning the eyes, as it is literally expressed, inwards.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
THE FREEDOM OF THE SOUL (Delivered in London, 5th November 1896)
The Katha Upanishad, which we have been studying, was written much later than that to which we now turn — the Chhāndogya. The language is more modern, and the thought more organised. In the older Upanishads the language is very archaic, like that of the hymn portion of the Vedas, and one has to wade sometimes through quite a mass of unnecessary things to get at the essential doctrines.</description>

THE COSMOS: THE MACROCOSM (Delivered in New York, 19th January 1896)
The flowers that we see all around us are beautiful, beautiful is the rising of the morning sun, beautiful are the variegated hues of nature. The whole universe is beautiful, and man has been enjoying it since his appearance on earth. Sublime and awe-inspiring are the mountains; the gigantic rushing rivers rolling towards the sea, the trackless deserts, the infinite ocean, the starry heavens — all these are awe-inspiring, sublime, and beautiful indeed.</description>

THE COSMOS: THE MICROCOSM (Delivered in New York, 26th January 1896)
The human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. The eye must see, the ear must hear, the senses must sense the external world — and naturally the beauties and sublimities of nature captivate the attention of man first. The first questions that arose in the human soul were about the external world.</description>

IMMORTALITY (Delivered in America)
What question has been asked a greater number of times, what idea has led men more to search the universe for an answer, what question is nearer and dearer to the human heart, what question is more inseparably connected with our existence, than this one, the immortality of the human soul? It has been the theme of poets and sages, of priests and prophets; kings on the throne have discussed it, beggars in the street have dreamt of it.</description>

In what is being written and taught in the West about the religious thought of India, one school of Indian thought is principally represented, that which is called Advaitism, the monistic side of Indian religion; and sometimes it is thought that all the teachings of the Vedas are comprised in that one system of philosophy.</description>

THE ATMAN: ITS BONDAGE AND FREEDOM (Delivered in America)
According to the Advaita philosophy, there is only one thing real in the universe, which it calls Brahman; everything else is unreal, manifested and manufactured out of Brahman by the power of Māyā. To reach back to that Brahman is our goal. We are, each one of us, that Brahman, that Reality, plus this Maya. If we can get rid of this Maya or ignorance, then we become what we really are.</description>

The West, if it does not always show outright hostility to India, often displays aggressive ignorance – the United States being the prime example – although things are changing thanks to Clinton’s 1999 visit. France, a country which had a huge sympathy capital in India, has not exploited it because it is obsessed with China. On the friendly side, the countries are very few : there is Israel, which shares so much with India, yet has been ignored for decades to please the Arabs; or non-communist Russia, which is discovering anew that she and India are fighting a lonely battle against Muslim fundamentalism.</description>

We had the same Constitution before also, but partition could not be prevented in spite of the sacrifice of Mahatma Gandhi - showering liberties on a people bent on separation.</description>

Ancient India was celebrated for its learning all over civilized Asia and Europe. Megasthenese (ca. 302 BC) was struck by the depth of this learning during his mission to the court of Chandragupta. Fa-hien, the famous Chinese traveller (399413 AD) spent some years at the Pataliputra and Tamralipti monasteries. He also spent two years in Ceylon which too had its monasteries after the India fashion.</description>

These people can talk and write endlessly about the miracles that have materialised in Soviet society. But no one can ever involve them into a discussion based on known facts.</description>

To round off the theoretical discussion of jihãd I must pass on to the doctrine of ghanîmah as explained in the Koran and the Hadis. We have seen that the reward of a mujãhid in the hereafter is the highest heaven. What is his reward on earth? It is ‘plunder’, or ‘spoils of war’, or ‘war booty’, as the Arabic expression ghanîmah is variously translated.</description>

There is no known evidence of a dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity before the end of the seventeenth century, though by that time they had come into contact with one another on as many as four occasions. If individual Hindus and Christians ever exchanged any notes on the nature of God and soul and human destiny, the record was not kept or has not survived or is yet to surface.</description>

      <description>6. Are Hindu reformists Hindus?
The historical and legal definition of “Hindus” as “Indian Pagans” is clear-cut, easy to use, and it has the law and historical primogeniture on its side. This inclusive definition of Hinduism is eagerly used by Hindu nationalist organizations (usually in its Savarkarite “Hindutva” adaptation), but there is still a serious problem with it: a number of the people included object to the label “Hindu”. Indeed, this label is often in conflict with the self-descriptions of certain communities, particularly among the Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and some of, the Scheduled Tribes.</description>

      <description>6. The details about “Hindu iconoclasm”
A remarkable aspect of the Ayodhya debate is the complete lack of active involvement by Western scholars. Their role has been limited to that of loudspeakers for the secularist-cum-Islamist party-line denying that any temple demolition had preceded the construction of the Babri Masjid. Even those who (like Hans Bakker and Peter Van der Veer) had earlier given their innocent support to the historical account, putting the Ayodhya case in the context of systematic Islamic iconoclasm, hurried to fall in line once the secularist campaign of history-rewriting started.</description>

      <description>6. Communalists and their communities 6.1 Hindu Society In many press reports, it has been said that the Ayodhya conflict is a conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. Upon closer inspection, that may not be entirely accurate.
JNU historian Bipan Chandra has often stated that the religious community is really a fictional entity which in people&amp;rsquo;s consciousness only blurs the real-life categories like socio-economical class. The sense of being a member of a religious community such as the Hindus or the Muslims is merely false consciousness, fostered by leaders who want to use the masses for their own social and political ambitions.</description>

Starting Point of Universal Spirituality
Hindu seers and sages could tap the sources of universal spirituality because they did not start with an a priori assumption of an Almighty God whom man had to fear and obey in awe and objection. Nor did they fortify this a priori assumption with a framework of deductive inferences drawn from an observed order in the workings of the outer world. They never asserted that an Almighty God had to be accepted as a matter of faith as the creator and controller of the cosmos.</description>

 One point where the BJP seems to be decidedly un-Gandhian is  defence policy. Whereas Gandhi had advocated a strictly non-violent strategy including an unarmed defence against the impending Japanese invasion, the BJP advocates a strong defence capability including weapons of mass destruction. Yet, even here the BJP is more Gandhian than one would expect.
 The famous quotation of Mahatma Gandhi on Hindu cowards and  Muslim bullies deserves to be read in full: &amp;ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind that in the majority of quarrels the Hindus come out second best.</description>

Benares is surely the queen of all the cities that have been built by the sided of the cool, clear, and holy waters of the Bhagirathi. The rows of houses mounting higher and higher from the banks of the Ganges, the domes of tall temples with golden steeples glittering in the sun, the thick rows of trees gracefully raising heads to the sky, the grand harmony of the innumerable bells sounded in the temples, and, above all, the sacred temple of Vishweshvarfa, all these give a unique splendour to the city of Benares.</description>

Factors Contributing to the Growth of Muslim Population
A study of the preceding pages clearly shows that the rise in Muslim population was due mainly to conversions of Hindus to Islam. It also needs no reiteration that “it was part of the state policy to establish Islam as the religion of the whole land”.^(1) It would again be a truism to say that “Islam is essentially a missionary religion” and every Muslim is a propagandist of his faith; and as they settled in India, they must have entered upon proselytizing efforts.</description>

The history of Christianity helps us in understanding what the Holy Spirit really stands for-the march of European military machines, the forcible occupation of other people&amp;rsquo;s motherlands, the massacre of heathens or their conversion at the point of the sword, the exercise of political pressures by imperialist establishments, the use of money and manpower and the mass media on a large scale, and the perfection of a scholarship which excels in suppressio veri suggestio falsi (suppressing truth and spreading falsehood).</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 8 - Towards A Language of Indian Nationalism We have seen in the foregoing chapters, that India&amp;rsquo;s prevalent political parlance - Right and Left, Reactionary and Progressive Revivalist and Revolutionary, Fascist and Democratic, Communal and Secular, Capitalist and Socialist,, etc. &amp;ndash; is an alien imposition imported mostly from Soviet Russia by a fifth-column of Communist imperialism. We have also seen how this language shares its basic characteristic with the languages of Islamic, Christian and British imperialism.</description>

Historians Versus History
Ram Swarup
Wole Soyinka, African Nobel Laureate, delivering the 20th Nehru Memorial Lecture on November 13, 1988, made an important though by no means a new observation - that the colonial histories have been written from the European viewpoint. Speaking about Indian histories, he said that “there is a big question mark on everything that the British historians have written”. He added that serious efforts are being made by historians back home “to rewrite African history.</description>

THE EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
Commenting on the history of Central Asia, Heinrich Zimmer writes: “During the sixth and early seventh centuries AD the whole tract was controlled by Turkish rulers, but in the course of the seventh, with increasing strength of the T’ang Emperors, China gained control. Finally, however, under the onslaught of Islam, from the eighth century to the tenth, both Buddhist and Manichaean as well as the Nestorian Christian culture and monuments of the region were destroyed.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
SLAVE-TAKING DURING MUSLIM RULE
Slavery forms an integral part of the history of Islam. The Turks practised it on a large scale before they entered India as invaders. Slaves were abducted or captured by marauders (Subuktigin, Balban), they were sold by jealous or needy relatives (Iltutmish), and they were purchased by slave-traders to be sold for profit (Aibak). These methods were known to Muslim rulers in India. All these and many other methods were employed by them and their nobles in making slaves in India.</description>

THE MAGNITUDE OF MUSLIM ATROCITIES - II
The NCERT is not the only villain in the game of propping up palpable falsehoods in the field of medieval Indian history. For quite some time, the All India Radio has been presenting a programme in Hindi - Itihãsa Ke Jharokhe Se (Window on History). The refrain is that medieval India under Muslim rule was a period of peace and amity between Hindus and Muslims, and that Muslim rulers, particularly Aurangzeb, went out of their way to be kind and considerate to the Hindus.</description>

JOURNEY FROM JIHÃD TO JEE-HUZÛRÎ
“It is obvious to your exalted self that the alien people from distant lands have become the rulers of territories and times, and the traders and vendors of goods have attained the rank of sovereignty. They have destroyed the dominions of the big grandees and the estates of the nobles of illustrious ranks, and their honour and authority have been completely set at naught… As soon as the land of Hindustan is cleared of the alien enemies and the efforts of these people [the Wahabis] result in the achievement of their objective, the ranks and offices of the state and government would be handed over to the seekers [of these], and the roots of their power and sovereignty would be strengthened.</description>

      <description>But this new word Bharatavarsha could not altogether suppress our cradle name Sindhus or Hindus nor could it make us forget the love we bore to that River of rivers - the Sindhu at whose breast our Patriarchs and people had drunk the milk of life. Our frontier provinces which bordered the course of Indus still clung to their ancient name Sindhu Rashtra. And throughout the Sanskrit literature we find Sindhu Sauveers recognized as an integral and an important part of our body politic.</description>

      <description>While Aurangzeb, weighed down with the wreck of all his hopes and anti- Hindu ambitions, sank in a gloomy grave, the Marathas carried the war far and wide into the Mogul territories of Khandesh, Gondvan, Berar and even Gujarat. The release of Shahu, the formal recognition by the Mogul Emperor of the claims of the Marathas to Swaraj in Maharashtra proper and to Chowth and Sardeshmukhi over the six Subhas of the Deccan, as well as in the tributary states of Mysore and Travancore, strengthened the hands of the Marathas as never before, and gave them breathing time to put their house in order and dress their wounds of fierce party passions and the centripetal tendencies and interests and to constitute the Marathas into an organised whole, with all its inherent and perhaps inevitable weakness, gave so splendid an account of itself that the ‘Maharashtra mandal’ or the Maratha Confederacy actually became the Hindu-pad-padashahi and ruled, not in name but in fact, all over Hindustan.</description>

Firing continued to be directed against the famous Dehra Sahib Gurdwara of Lahore, site of the martyrdom of Sri Guru Arjan Dev, fifth Guru of the Sikhs. This, in spite of the fact that this place is situated at a distance of hardly five yards from the Lahore Fort, Headquarters of the Additional Police and military pickets for the city. Water-taps supplying water to the Gurdwara estate were cut off, so that the inmates about 150 in number, should be left to die through sheer thirst.</description>

Seaton had been marching slowly, &amp;lsquo;paficying&amp;rsquo; provionces on the way, and had now come down to Aligarh. So now Walpole was sent by Kalpi road to accomplish the same task for all the territory from Aligarh to Cawnpore. Walpole was to march upwards from Cawnpore and Seaton was to go downwards from Aligarh; they were to meet at Minpuri; and, thus, all the tract of the Doab along the Jumna was to be reconquered.</description>

      <description>Deifying the great – Misreading of scriptures – Selfishness, helplessness at the root – Effort is God – Great examples – Worship of the victorious – Martyr, great but not ideal – Lesson of Rajput martyrdom – Act, do not react – Philosophy of right action.
OUR great men stand as lamp posts on the path to the fulfillment of our national life- mission and national glory. In order that the coming generations may pursue that path with success, it is essential that their inspiring memories and examples are kept undimmed in the national mind and the lessons of the lives and deeds of those masters of thought and action are presented in their true perspective.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XV
THE REAL AND THE APPARENT MAN (Delivered in New York)
Here we stand, and our eyes look forward sometimes miles ahead. Man has been doing that since he began to think. He is always looking forward, looking ahead. He wants to know where he goes even after the dissolution of his body. Various theories have been propounded, system after system has been brought forward to suggest explanations. Some have been rejected, while others have been accepted, and thus it will go on, so long as man is here, so long as man thinks.</description>

      <description>PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART I
(Delivered in London, 10th November 1896)
I have been asked to say something about the practical position of the Vedanta philosophy. As I have told you, theory is very good indeed, but how are we to carry it into practice? If it be absolutely impracticable, no theory is of any value whatever, except as intellectual gymnastics. The Vedanta, therefore, as a religion must be intensely practical. We must be able to carry it out in every part of our lives.</description>

I will relate to you a very ancient story from the Chhāndogya Upanishad, which tells how knowledge came to a boy. The form of the story is very crude, but we shall find that it contains a principle. A young boy said to his mother, &amp;ldquo;I am going to study the Vedas. Tell me the name of my father and my caste.</description>

(Delivered in London, 17th November 1896)
In the Chhādogya Upanishad we read that a sage called Nārada came to another called Sanatkumāra, and asked him various questions, of which one was, if religion was the cause of things as they are. And Sanatkumara leads him, as it were, step by step, telling him that there is something higher than this earth, and something higher than that, and so on, till he comes to Âkāsha, ether.</description>

      <description>PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART IV
(Delivered in London, 18th November 1896)
We have been dealing more with the universal so far. This morning I shall try to place before you the Vedantic ideas of the relation of the particular to the universal. As we have seen, in the dualistic form of Vedic doctrines, the earlier forms, there was a clearly defined particular and limited soul for every being. There have been a great many theories about this particular soul in each individual, but the main discussion was between the ancient Vedantists and the ancient Buddhists, the former believing in the individual soul as complete in itself, the latter denying in toto the existence of such an individual soul.</description>

      <description>THE WAY TO THE REALISATION OF A UNIVERSAL RELIGION (Delivered in the Universalist Church, Pasadena,
California, 28th January 1900)
No search has been dearer to the human heart than that which brings to us light from God. No study has taken so much of human energy, whether in times past or present, as the study of the soul, of God, and of human destiny. However immersed we are in our daily occupations, in our ambitions, in our work, in the midst of the greatest of our struggles, sometimes there will come a pause; the mind stops and wants to know something beyond this world.</description>

      <description>THE IDEAL OF A UNIVERSAL RELIGION HOW IT MUST EMBRACE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MINDS AND METHODS
Wheresoever our senses reach, or whatsoever our minds imagine, we find therein the action and reaction of two forces, the one counteracting the other and causing the constant play of the mixed phenomena that we see around us, and of those which we feel in our minds. In the external world, the action of these opposite forces is expressing itself as attraction and repulsion, or as centripetal and centrifugal forces; and in the internal, as love and hatred, good and evil.</description>

      <description>THE OPEN SECRET (Delivered at Los Angeles, Calif., 5th January 1900)
Whichever way we turn in trying to understand things in their reality, if we analyse far enough, we find that at last we come to a peculiar state of things, seemingly a contradiction: something which our reason cannot grasp and yet is a fact. We take up something — we know it is finite; but as soon as we begin to analyse it, it leads us beyond our reason, and we never find an end to all its qualities, its possibilities, its powers, its relations.</description>

      <description>THE WAY TO BLESSEDNESS I shall tell you a story from the Vedas tonight. The Vedas are the sacred scriptures of the Hindus and are a vast collection of literature, of which the last part is called the Vedanta, meaning the end of the Vedas. It deals with the theories contained in them, and more especially the philosophy with which we are concerned. It is written in archaic Sanskrit, and you must remember it was written thousands of years ago.</description>

You know, the Shastras in India enjoin that every man should give up the world when he becomes old. So Yajnavalkya said to his wife, &amp;ldquo;My beloved, here is all my money, and my possessions, and I am going away.</description>

There are three countries which offer to India examples not to follow: East Timor, Yugoslavia and Tibet. East Timor showed how converted Christians provoke secession by alleging &amp;ldquo;persecution&amp;rdquo; and how the West has a very short memory. Pundits have predicted for decades the balkanisation of India, as it happened in Yugoslavia at the hands of Kosovo; so far it has not materialised, but if India allows Kashmir to go, who knows what might follow.</description>

 You have performed a service by circulating the note of Dr. Shreerang Godbole. The note raises pertinent questions about the usefulness of the movement for equality amongst religions as. presently conceived by the RSS leadership. His observations are also relevant at the international level.
People who ask Hindus to treat all religions equally are barking up the wrong tree. Pluralism in faith is part of the baggage that every Hindu carries from cradle to grave.</description>

The points made out by a progressive Muslim, Asghar Ali Engineer, in support of the telecast of the serial, &amp;lsquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&amp;quot;, are really very interesting. He bluntly states, &amp;ldquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan may be a historical novel, and the story may be somewhat different from actual history.</description>

India and Greece
The movement of men and ideas from the West to the East is a recent phenomenon. There was a time when the movement was in the opposite direction and the East had gone to the West in a big way.
At that time, India&amp;rsquo;s cultural frontiers too were wider than her political frontiers and her ideas influenced lands and people far away from her physically. Vedic India shared many of her Gods with Iran and one of them, Mithra (Mitra), went on a long journey to the West.</description>

And he generally turns towards &amp;ldquo;Soviet achievements at home&amp;rdquo; whenever he finds that a defence of Soviet foreign policy at some point is a somewhat more difficult job.

Plunder (Ghanîmah) in the Hadis
(1) Is plunder compatible with religion and piety? We have seen that the Koran itself says ‘yes’. But it appears that some objection was raised against this view as early as the Prophet’s own life-time. The Prophet himself met this objection in a somewhat longish hadîs. We find him declaring in favour of the Koranic view by contrasting Allah’s dispensation regarding plunder in the epoch of former prophets with that in his own.</description>

7.1. Joins in the Minorities’ Commission
One of the least vocal communities in India is the Jain community. When the Minorities’ Commission was formed in 1978, the Jains were somehow overlooked, though Sikhs and Buddhists were invited to join. No Jain protest was heard. It seemed that as a prosperous business community, the Jains were not too interested in the politics of grievances, and therefore they didn’t care too much whether they were entitled to minority status.</description>

Moghul emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (r.1658-1707) is an icon of Islamic iconoclasm in India. His name counts as synonymous with destruction of Hindu temples, though he also levelled many Hindu human beings. Yet, the dominant school of historians would like to salvage Aurangzeb’s reputation.
Percival Spear, co-author (with Romila Thapar) of the prestigious Penguin History of India, writes: “Aurangzeb’s supposed intolerance is little more than a hostile legend based on isolated acts such as the erection of a mosque on a temple site in Benares.</description>

In fact, the saga of how the people did it, is the stuff movies are made of. Hiding in jungles, swimming across the river at night, being caught and then escaping from prison to move on to Ayodhya (as firebrand BJP MP Uma Bharati did, making herself unrecognizable), it must have been quite an adventure for the people who did it.</description>

 A very serious flaw which Gandhians and the Sangh have in  common is their anti-intellectualism. Though Gandhi reputedly rebuked RSS founder K.B. Hedgewar for not publishing any doctrinal statements, i.e. for not giving any intellectual articulation to his nationalist movement, he essentially shared Hedgewar&amp;rsquo;s aversion for an intellectual job well done. Both of them made people march many miles, both led their followers to make great sacrifices, and both failed to substantially raise their followers&#39; political understanding.</description>

      <description>“Oh blest are the bravest friends Who shall live the day of glory to see! But next dearest blessing that heaven can give Is the pride of thus dying for thee.
 Thomas Moore  At last Mr. Savarkar landed back on those native shores for which “he longed and he pined”—but in a very different way. As soon as steamer reached Bombay he was escorted down through rows of drawn swords and cuffed.</description>

§ 1. His Contemporaries
 At the time when Gautama took Parivraja, there was a great intellectual ferment in the country. Besides the Brahmanic Philosophy there were as many as sixty-two different schools of philosophy, all opposed to the Brahmanic Philosophy.</description>

      <description>LET us now leave aside, for a moment, the bloody streams of the Revolutionary Ganges flowing about violently on the fields of Northern India with the holy desire of saving our forefathers from the bottomless pit of slavery, and turn to the events happening at its source at Haridwar. About the time of the Meerut rising, there were assembled a larger number of Revolutionary leaders in the palace of Nana Sahib than could be found, at the time, in the palace of Lucknow, in the Subah at Bareilly, or even at the Dewan-I-Khas palace at Delhi.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6
Factors which Checked Islamization of India
Now, if the components of growth of Muslim population were many, Muslim losses comparatively few, and fecundity among them high, the problem that needs investigation is why Muslims have remained a minority in this country and why India, unlike many other countries in the medieval period, could not be completely converted to Islam.
Vastness of the Country
The vastness of the country and its natural and political division into regions and kingdoms made the task of its complete subjugation and conversion extremely difficult.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER 6
JIHAD IN INDIA’S HISTORY
The principles of jihAd elaborated in countless compendia composed by Islamic scholars, have been generalized from concrete practices of the Prophet, and confirmed by Allah through “revelations” in the Quran. In turn, these principles have guided all swordsmen of Islam throughout these fourteen countries and in many lands.
India has had a prolonged experience of jihAd from the day when the first Muslim army stepped into Sindh in 712 CE and won its first victories after suffering a number of defeats for 78 years.</description>

Catholic Ashrams
Adopting and Adapting Hindu Dharma
The Shantivanam Ashram looks like a rishi&amp;rsquo;s home transported from Vedic times to the banks of the sacred Cauvery River at a forested place near Trichy in South India. A pilgrim&amp;rsquo;s first impressions are strong, and very Hindu; the elaborately colourful Hindu shrine; the bearded, saffron-robed &amp;ldquo;swami&amp;rdquo; seated cross - legged on a straw mat; devotees practising yogic meditations, even chanting Hindu scriptures.</description>

November 9 Will Change History
Jay Dubashi
What is the need of the hour, someone asked me the other day. Is it stability, is it unity, is it communal peace? It is none of these things, I told him. The need of the hour is COURAGE.
We Hindus have become a timid race, almost a cowardly race. We lack the courage of our convictions. Some of us don’t even have any convictions, and have been trying to hide our shame under high-sounding but empty phrases like secularism.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SEVEN
THE LITERARY EVIDENCE
Islamic literary sources provide far more extensive evidence of temple destruction by the Muslim invaders of India in medieval times. They also cover a larger area, from Sinkiang and Transoxiana in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, and from the Seistan province of present-day Iran in the West to Assam in the East. As we wade through this evidence, we can visualise how this vast area, which was for long the cradle of Hindu culture, came to be literally littered with the ruins of temples and monasteries belonging to all schools of Sanãtana Dharma-Bauddha, Jaina, Šaiva, Šãkta, VaishNava and the rest.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VI
ENSLAVEMENT AND PROSELYTIZATION
Wherever the Muslims conquered - in West Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and India - there they made people slaves and converted them to Islam. In this mission they were most successful in Africa and the least in India.
At the advent of Islam, part of Arabia was under Abyssinian rule. When Arabia was Islamized, the tide turned and the Abyssinians came under the Arabs and they made slaves of Abyssinians and Ethiopians without much opposition.</description>

NATIONAL RESURGENCE REVILED AS HINDU REVIVALISM
Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati (1824-1883) was speaking at a meeting in Calcutta when some stones were thrown at him by some members of the audience disgruntled by his criticism of Hindu orthodoxy. He remained calm and self-possessed. He appealed for a patient hearing in the following words: “The British Government has guaranteed freedom of speech to all of us. Why should I be deprived of that freedom?</description>

THE MYTH OF MUSLIM EMPIRE IN INDIA
The apologists of Islam and their secularist lick-spittles argue that if the Muslim conquerors had practised such systematic, extensive, and continued terror against Hindus and Hinduism as has been recorded by the Muslim historians of medieval India, Hindus could not have survived as an overwhelming majority at the end of the long spell of Muslim rule.
The logic here is purely deductive (formal).</description>

On the first day of July 1910, the steamer s.s, morea convey- ing Savarkar to India started on her historic voyage from London ! Proud like a kite, she held her prey in the clutches. She tossed on. But woe followed the waves. The book of fate was signed and sealed by destiny ! There was some engine trouble and the morea required repairs in the neigh- bourhood of the port of Marseilles.</description>

      <description>Although Indians were by no means cut off from the outside world before the rise of Buddhism and although their world activities had already assumed such dimensions as to give a just occasion to our patriotic poet law-givers to claim [Let all the people of the world learn their duties from the elders born in this land]; yet as far as the present arguement is concerned, the international life of India after the rise of Buddhism, requires chiefly to be considered, because it was about this time when political enterprise having exposed or exhausted all possibilities of expansion in our own land naturally began to overflow its limits to an extent unevidenced before and the communications with the outsiders began to knock at our doors more impudently and even imperatively than they ever had done.</description>

      <description>NIGHTMARE OF NEHRUISM I am adding this postscript to the third reprint of what may be described as my intellectual autobiography in order to complete my story as a convinced and conscious Hindu. The story relates mainly to my encounter with Nehruism in its various expressions.
Today, I view Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru as a bloated Brown Sahib, and Nehruism as the combined embodiment of all the imperialist ideologies Islam, Christianity, White Man&amp;rsquo;s Burden, and Communism that have flooded this country in the wake of foreign invasions.</description>

CHAPTER I. – RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN OTHER COUNTRIES
The joint Committee appointed by the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America and the Foreign Missions Conference of North America in the year 1944, in their “Statement on Religious Liberty”, have defined the term as given below:-
 “Religious Liberty shall be interpreted to include freedom to worship according to conscience and to bring up children in the faith of their parents; freedom for the individual to change his religion; freedom to preach, educate, publish and carry on missionary activities; and freedom to organise with others, and to acquire and hold property, for these purposes”.</description>

Freedom’s sword will strongly draw,
Freeman stand or freeman fall

By your sons in servile chains,
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be free!!

Tyrants fall in every foe,
Liberty’s in every blow,

It has been the tragic lesson of the history of many a country in the world that the hostile elements within the country pose a far greater menace to national security than aggressors from outside. Unfortunately, this first lesson of national security has been the one thing, which has been consistently ignored in our country ever since the British left this land.</description>

      <description>SOUL, NATURE, AND GOD According to the Vedanta philosophy, man consists of three substances, so to say. The outermost is the body, the gross form of man, in which are the instruments of sensation, such as the eyes, nose, ears, and so forth. This eye is not the organ of vision; it is only the instrument. Behind that is the organ. So, the ears are not the organs of hearing; they are the instruments, and behind them is the organ, or what, in modern physiology, is called the centre.</description>

      <description>COSMOLOGY There are two worlds, the microcosm, and the macrocosm, the internal and the external. We get truth from both of these by means of experience. The truth gathered from internal experience is psychology, metaphysics, and religion; from external experience, the physical sciences. Now a perfect truth should be in harmony with experiences in both these worlds. The microcosm must bear testimony to the macrocosm, and the macrocosm to the microcosm; physical truth must have its counterpart in the internal world, and the internal world must have its verification outside.</description>

      <description>A STUDY OF THE SANKHYA PHILOSOPHY Prakriti is called by the Sānkhya philosophers indiscrete, and defined as the perfect balance of the materials in it; and it naturally follows that in perfect balance there cannot be any motion. In the primal state before any manifestation, when there was no motion but perfect balance, this Prakriti was indestructible, because decomposition or death comes from instability or change. Again, according to the Sankhya, atoms are not the primal state.</description>

      <description>SANKHYA AND VEDANTA I shall give you a résumé of the Sānkhya philosophy, through which we have been going. We, in this lecture, want to find where its defects are, and where Vedanta comes in and supplements it. You must remember that according to Sankhya philosophy, nature is the cause of all these manifestations which we call thought, intellect, reason, love, hatred, touch, taste, and matter. Everything is from nature. This nature consists of three sorts of elements, called Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.</description>

The lecture on the Divinity of Man by Swami Vive Kananda, (In the earlier days Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s name was thus mis-spelt by the American Press. — Publisher.) the Hindu monk, drew a packed house at the Opera last Friday evening [February 22].
He stated that the fundamental basis of all religions was belief in the soul which is the real man, and something beyond both mind and matter, and proceeded to demonstrate the proposition.</description>

Bay City had a distinguished visitor yesterday in the person of Swami Vive Kananda, the much talked of Hindoo monk. He arrived at noon from Detroit where he has been the guest of Senator Palmer and proceeded immediately to the Fraser house. There he was seen by a reporter for The Tribune.

Swami Vive Kananda, the much talked of Hindoo monk, spoke to a small but deeply interested audience last evening at the academy of music on &amp;ldquo;The Harmony of Religions&amp;rdquo;. He was dressed in oriental costume and received an extremely cordial reception. Hon. Rowland Connor gracefully introduced the speaker, who devoted the first portion of his lecture to an explanation of the different religions of India and of the theory of transmigration of souls.</description>

      <description>FROM FAR OFF INDIA (Saginaw Courier-Herald, March 22, 1894)
Seated in the lobby of the Hotel Vincent yesterday evening was a strong and regular featured man of fine presence, whose swarthy skin made more pronounced the pearly whiteness of his even teeth. Under a broad and high forehead his eyes betoken intelligence. This gentleman was Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindoo preacher. Mr. Kananda&amp;rsquo;s conversation is in pure and grammatically constructed English sentences, to which his slightly foreign accent lends piquancy.</description>

For, the ideological clarity, historical perception, understanding of national issues and intellectual awareness that he has exhibited in his two short write-ups, have been so sadly lacking in the top-brass of the organisation.

TIPU SULTAN: A FANATIC MUSLIM
RAVI VARMA
The Union Government&amp;rsquo;s decision to ban the book on Prophet Mohammad entitled The Satanic Verses, by an internationally renowned Muslim scholar, Mr. Salman Rushdie, has been described as a shameful surrender to the minority lobby of fanatic Muslim leaders like Shahabuddin, Sulaiman Sait and Imam Bukhari. Similarly, the internationally acclaimed film on Jesus Christ titled Last Temptation of Jesus Christ has been banned in India so that the religious feelings of the tiny though powerful Christian community may not be hurt.</description>

      <description>9. THE FALSE GODS
The Indian mind’s spontaneous tendency is that of bhakti, of worshipping ‘That’ which it feels is above himself. While it is a wonderful trait which has brought an innocence and a freshness to the Indian psyche, it has been taken advantage in modern times by politicians, Christian missionaries and intellectuals. Mother Teresa, the Mahatma Gandhi, Rama Rao, or Sonia Gandhi, while they may have been outstanding personalities in their own right, have all, consciously or unconsciously exploited this innocence, whereas they did not always deserved the status of Gods or semi-Gods given to them.</description>

A PERSISTENT PRO-SOVIET SPEAKER
Pandit Nehru&amp;rsquo;s admirers are prepared to admit that he was influenced by communist thought to quite an extent before he became the first Prime Minister of independent India in August 1947. But they maintain (of course, in a purely a priory fashion) that since that event his sense of responsibility as leader of a major democracy has considerably diluted his devotion to purely theoretical questions, and developed in him a sense of proportion regarding the Soviet Union.</description>

**Islamic Expansion through Jihãd: **
The Evidence of the Sunnah
In the foregoing chapters I have attempted to give a brief but complete outline of the Islamic theory of jihãd, that is, the injunctions of Allah and his Prophet regarding the subject. However, no part of Islamic theory is supposed to be complete without a description of the Prophet’s own actions in terms to those injunctions. In fact, these actions in their totality are the Sunnah properly so called, the mere injunctions even from the Prophet’s mouth being only a part of it.</description>

His family along with several others had migrated to Pondicherry at the invitation of the French who occupied that town as the headquarters of their possessions in India. These families had brought considerable prosperity to it.</description>

      <description>8. Are Sikhs Hindus?
8.1. The problem of Sikh identity
In most of the contemporary literature, Sikhism is treated as a separate religion. The questioning of this separateness by Hindus is usually only mentioned in scornful tones, as a sign of “Hindu fundamentalist” sympathies. Most non-specialist Western sources implicitly support Sikh separatism, at least the religious, non-territorial variety. Thus, the cover story on India in the non-political American monthly National Geographic carries a picture of a typical-looking Sikh before the Hari Mandir in Amritsar, with the caption: “The Golden Temple in Amritsar serves as the spiritual centre for the world’s 20 million Sikhs.</description>

Indian Cbilstians and their allies in the international media have mostly taken the Muslim side in the Ayodhya dispute. This was the reason for the following open letter to the Church dignitaries, written in the last days of the year 1999, the occasion being the emergence of a vaguely similar problem in Nazareth. Muslims bad illegally started building a mosque next to a church, and the Israeli authorities bad not dared to interfere.</description>

The misuse of history 8.1 Caught in the act of distorting history The Ram Janmabhoomi/Babri Masjid issue has highlighted several more fundamental problems which will have to be dealt with decisively. Perhaps the most important one is the intellectual dishonesty which dominates India&amp;rsquo;s official ideology and its arena of public debate. One area where this dishonesty has been having a free ride during the last several decades, is history-writing. A case in point is the JNU historians&#39; statement on Ayodhya, published in November 1989: The Political Abuse of History.</description>

Character Of Nehruvian Secularism
Twenty years ago I had been invited to a seminar on Hurdles To Secularism.^(1) It was presided over by the late Shri Jayaprakash Narayan (JP). The Working Paper had been prepared by the late Professor A.B. Shah. It was a surprising departure from the usual norm of such papers. While he had repeated the current cliches about ‘Hindu communalism’, Professor Shah had been equally unsparing about what he had nailed down as ‘Muslim communalism’.</description>

 The anti-intellectualism of the Sangh Parivar is a sufficiently  serious problem to warrant a closer discussion.

The doctrine of jihAd, which is the whole of the Quran, deals primarily with the performance of the militarized Muslim Ummah till the time an “infidel land” is conquered and Muslim hold is consolidated over it by terrorising its people through slaughter and pillage. The operations of the same military machine after the conquest are dealt with by another department of Islamic theology - doctrine of the Islamic state.</description>

The J.R. Ewing Syndrome
Television and movies struggle mightily to be dramatic, humorous, tragic, colorful, sexy and outrageous. Video is modern man&amp;rsquo;s moving canvas; like a painting, it can mimic but never match the real thing - life.
But perhaps it can help us interpret experience, find useful analogies, study the human condition. In fact, it did just that last night. As we pondered the front page story, seeking ways to explain the Hindu&amp;rsquo;s profound concerns to the global Catholic community, our analogy appeared on the screen.</description>

      <description>Chapter Eight
From Shilanyas to Berlin Wall
Jay Dubashi
History has its quirks but there is a method behind the madness. I said in my last column that November 9, 1989, would go down in Indian history as one of those dates that actually make history. I was not aware at the time that on the very same day the first brick of the Ramshila foundation was being laid at Ayodhya, the Berliners were removing bricks from the Berlin Wall.</description>

SUMMING UP
Starting with Al-Bilãdhurî who wrote in Arabic in the second half of the ninth century, and coming down to Syed Mahmudul Hasan who wrote in English in the fourth decade of the twentieth, we have cited from eighty histories spanning a period of more than twelve hundred years. Our citations mention sixty-one kings, sixty-three military commanders and fourteen sufis who destroyed Hindu temples in one hundred and fifty-four localities, big and small, spread from Khurasan in the West to Tripura in the East, and from Transoxiana in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, over a period of eleven hundred years.</description>

LOSS OF PRIVILEGES PORTRAYED AS PRIVATION
A British scholar and civil servant, W.W. Hunter, wrote the book, The Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel against the Queen?, which was published in 1871. It was reviewed by Alfred Lyall who was soon to succeed as the Lieutenant Governor of the North West Province (later on known as U.P.). Lyall had warned that “what Hunter had said will be overheard by Indian Muslims; they will be encouraged to think of themselves as ‘an oppressed people or a persecuted sect’.</description>

THE DETERMINANTS OF HINDU DEFEATS
It is true that Hindus resisted Islamic imperialism for a long time, and overcame it in the long run. But it would be foolish to forget that their failure for a long time in the face of an enemy with whom they had become familiar pretty soon, was of frightening proportions. It is this failure of the Hindus and not the defeat of the Muslim marauders which invites a serious review and reflection.</description>

STRUGGLE FOR POWER AMONG SLAVE NOBLES
Abdulla Khan’s words were prophetic. The population of Indian Muslims grew rapidly through enslavement. This rapid growth gave rise to new problems. One was a tussle for power between foreign slave-Amirs and Indian slaves some of whom also attained to the position of nobles. As among the Turkish Amirs themselves, a bitter struggle for clout also raged between foreign Turks and Indian Muslims.</description>

Editor&amp;rsquo;s arrest over Islamic study flayed1
By A Staff Reporter
NEW DELHI, December 26 - A number of intellectuals and writers have condemned the arrest of the editor of &amp;lsquo;Voice of India&amp;rsquo;, Mr. Sita Ram Goel, on December 19 for printing the Hindi version of a study - Understanding Islam through Hadis.
They pointed out, in a statement here today, that the English version of the study was printed abroad in 1982 and it had been reprinted twice in India.</description>

      <description>Epilogue
We began by noting that the sword of Islam was blunted in India. Islam had spread in Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Africa and even parts of Europe with a bang. Within a hundred years of the death of the Prophet this spectacular success had been achieved through the instrument of Jihad. It appeared as if there was no stopping the Islamic avalanche on the Globe, both to the east and the west of the land of its birth - Arabia.</description>

      <description>How thoroughly Baji Rao and his companions were brought up in the traditions of Shivaji and how closely they had studied the political policy and military strategy of that great leader, could best be seen both in the eloquent appeal, Baji Rao made to the Maratha leaders in the presence of Shahu, in which he expressly drew a telling comparison between the arduous circumstances under which Shivaji strove to carry the war of Hindu Liberation to the South and the relatively more favourable turn the events had taken since then, when his generation, instead of daring more in carrying the war to the north, sat doubting and deliberating as well as in the splendid campaigns against the Nizam, Bangesh and other mogul generals.</description>

      <description>FRONTIER PROVINCE AND D. I. KHAN
The wave of attacks on Hindus and Sikhs, travelling from the Rawalpindi and Multan Divisions, spread in a wild and virulent form to the N.-W. Frontier Province and especially to the Trans-Indus Frontier District of Dera Ismail Khan, in which as all over this area, Hindus and Sikhs were in microscopic minority. The Frontier adherents of the Muslim League fell upon the handful of Hindus and Sikhs with the primitive fanaticism characteristic of the Muslims of this area.</description>

      <description>AFTER the fall of Lucknow, there remained no powerful nucleus to concentrate the forces of the Revolutionaries in the provinces of Rohilkhand and Oudh. The tide of British conquest that has been sweeping over the Doab and Behar had driven all the Revolutionaries from these provinces into the ever-narrowing circle of Oudh and Rohilkhand. By this irresistible pressure on all sides and by want of powerful stronghold, the Revolutionaries had to give up the old system of open warfare and pitched battles and to take to guerilla tactics.</description>

      <description>SINCE Dalhousie annexed Outh, the people of that province had been sinking deeper and deeper in misery. After Oudh lost her independence, all the offices of honour, power, and wealth in the Nabob&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom were given to Englishmen, and theSwadeshi men had to go to the well. The Nabob&amp;rsquo;s army was disbanded, his nobles were driven into poverty, his ministers and other officers lost their positions and were pushed to the low ranks of wage- earners; and all of them entertained a rankling hatred of the slavery which destroyed their country and reduced them to such a state.</description>

      <description>PART IV
CHAPTER I. - CONCLUSIONS (FINDINGS)
On consideration of the material before us we arrive at the following conclusions of fact:-
1. Since the Constitution of India came into force there has been an appreciable increase in the American personnel of the Missionary organisations operating in India. This increase is obviously due to the deliberate policy of the International Missionary Council to send evangelistic teams to areas of special opportunities opened to the Gospel by the Constitutional provision of religions freedom in some of the newly independent nations, equipped with new resources for mass evangelism through the press, film, radio and television.</description>

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, gave an address last evening in Sever Hall under the auspices of the Harvard Religious Union. The address was very interesting, the clear and eloquent voice of the speaker, and his low, earnest delivery making his words singularly impressive.
There are various sects and doctrines in India, said Vivekananda, some of which accept the theory of a personal God, and others which believe that God and the universe are one; but whatever sect the Hindoo belongs to he does not say that his is the only right belief, and that all others must be wrong.</description>

Mr. Kananda spoke yesterday at the People&amp;rsquo;s Church on the invitation of Dr. Kent, pastor of the church. His talk in the morning was a regular sermon, dealing entirely with the spiritual side of religion, and presenting the, to orthodox sects, rather original proposition that there is good in the foundation of every religion, that all religions, like languages, are descended from a common stock, and that each is good in its corporal and spiritual aspects so long as it is kept free from dogma and fossilism.</description>

Swami Vivekananda, after being presented to the audience by Dr. Janes, president of the Ethical Association, said in part:
&amp;ldquo;The product of the slums of any nation cannot be the criterion of our judgment of that nation. One may collect the rotten, worm-eaten apples under every apple tree in the world, and write a book about each of them, and still know nothing of the beauty and possibilities of the apple tree.</description>

      <description>TRUE BUDDHISM (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 4, 1895)
Swami Vivekananda, being presented by Dr. Janes, the president of the Ethical Association, under whose auspices these lectures are given, said in part: &amp;ldquo;The Hindoo occupies a unique position towards Buddhism. Like Christ, who antagonized the Jews, Buddha antagonized the prevailing religion of India; but while Christ was rejected by his countrymen, Buddha was accepted as God Incarnate. He denounced the priestcraft at the very doors of their temples, yet to-day he is worshipped by them.</description>

      <description>10. THE GREAT INDIAN MYTHS
Since independence a few Great Indian Myths have done immeasurable harm to the country. Yet not only do they survive today, but they are often reborn under different avatars. One of these enduring myths concerns Ashoka the Great embracing Buddhism, and making it a State religion. Another of these other extremely pernicious myths is the Great Indo-Chinese friendship, which even the BJP today seems to sometimes believe in.</description>

Fomenting Reaction1
Arun Shourie
Ram Swarup, now in his seventies, is a scholar of the first rank. In the 1950s when our intellectuals were singing paeans to Marxism, and to Mao in particular, he wrote critiques of communism and of the actual - that is, dismal performance of communist governments. He showed that the &amp;ldquo;sacrifices&amp;rdquo; which the people were being compelled to make had nothing to do with building a new society in which at some future date they would be the heirs to milk and honey.</description>

K. GOVINDAN KUTTY
It was Bhagwan Gidwani&amp;rsquo;s obvious intention to extol Tipu Sultan when he wrote what he called a &amp;ldquo;historical novel&amp;rdquo; - The Sword of Tipu Sultan. Sanjay Khan&amp;rsquo;s approach to the subject could not have been different when he embarked on his controversial tele-film project based on Mr. Gidwani&amp;rsquo;s book. Whether their adulation of Tipu is consistent with facts of history is what an expert panel set up by the Ministry of information and Broadcasting is supposed to determine.</description>

A DEVOTED DISCIPLE OF STALIN
The question may be asked that if Pandit Nehru was not very important in the Congress organisation so long as Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel were alive, how did he come to dominate the organisation within a very short time after Sardar&amp;rsquo;s death, and to swing the country fast towards his Soviet Fatherland. An answer to this question needs an analysis of the character of our nationalism during our struggle with British imperialism.</description>

It was my intention to include in this series a few essays on Hindu Sociology and Hindu History as I see them after many years of study and reflection. But these themes would have to wait for some time. I will return to them later and discuss them with reference to Hindu Spirituality as I have presented it so far.

      <description>10. Anti-intellectualism in action
 The two most important consequences of the anti-intellectual  prejudice animating the Sangh are, firstly, an extreme ineptness at public relations, and secondly, the stunted development of the Sangh Parivar&amp;rsquo;s own intellectual grip on the world. An example of the first is the staggering failure of the Hindu campaign reclaiming Ayodhya to communicate its case to the world, as already discussed. The worst part of it is not that the Sangh people failed to communicate the Hindu case (the biased press was indeed a formidable obstacle), but that it never took the trouble of verifying whether its message came across nor of devising ways to deal with the hostile climate in the media and among India-watchers.</description>

**Destruction of Idols and Idol-Temples in **
Jihãd: The Evidence of the Sunnah
A natural and in fact inevitable consequence of spreading Islam by jihãd is the destruction of non-believers’ places of worship and their idols. It is somewhat remarkable that this duty has not been enjoined in any Koranic verse as a part of jihãd. The destruction of idols is often mentioned in the Koran, but nowhere in connection with jihãd.</description>

Encounter with Raja Ram Mohun Roy
The next significant dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity commenced more than a hundred years later, in 1820 to be exact. The venue was Calcutta. Raja Ram Mohun Roy was ranged on one side and the Serampore Missionaries on the other. By that time, British arms had subdued the whole of India except Ranjit Singh’s Sikh state beyond the Satlaj. Calcutta had emerged not only as the premier city of the British empire in India but also as the storm centre of Christianity.</description>

9.1. “Animism”
Hindu Revivalists, unlike Hindu traditionalists, agree that the so-called tribals of India are Hindus. V.D. Savarkar wrote: “Every person is a Hindu who regards and owns this Bharat Bhumi, this land from the Indus to the seas, as his Fatherland as well as Holyland, i.e. the land of the origin of his religion (…) Consequently the so-called aboriginal or hill tribes also are Hindus: because India is their Fatherland as well as their Holyland of whatever form of religion or worship they follow.</description>

      <description>9. Secularism and India&amp;rsquo;s integrity 9.1 Separatism and anti-Hinduism In the present context, the link between history-writing and actual politics is extra-ordinarily strong. Witness the crucial role of the Aryan invasions theory in the secularist and casteist/Ambedkarist ideologies, as earlier in the missionary and colonial ideologies. In fact, I can not think of any situation in world history where history-writing was so intertwined with both long- term political philosophy and short-term political equations.</description>

      <description>Buddhism had made the first and yet the greatest attempt to propagate a universal religion. &amp;lsquo;Go, ye Bhikkus, to all the ten directions of the world and preach the law of Righteousness ! &#39; Truly, it was a law of Righteousness. It had no ulterior end in view, no lust for land or lucre quickening its steps; but grand though its achievements were it could not eradicate the seeds of animal passions nor of political ambitions nor of individual aggrandisement in the minds of all men to such an extent as to make it safe for India to change her sword for a rosary.</description>

All relevant British government records followed by the District Gazetteer Faizabad compiled and published by the Congress government in 1960 declare with one voice that the so-called Babari mosque at Ayodhya is standing on the debris of a Ramjanmasthan temple demolished by the order of Babar in 1528. Syed Shahabuddin, JNU historians, and. self-styled ‘secular’ scholars and leaders are hotly contesting that the existence and demolition of such a temple is a myth floated by the British in pursuance of their policy of ‘divide and rule’.</description>

THE SEPARATIST SEWER POLLUTES THE NATIONAL MAINSTREAM
There is one chapter in the history of our freedom movement against British imperialism which has caused considerable confusion. This chapter opened with the signing of the Lucknow Pact in December 1916, and closed with the withdrawal of the first Non-Cooperation Movement by Mahatma Gandhi in February 1922. Many politicians and historians have looked back wistfully to those ‘wonderful days of Hindu-Muslim unity’ when the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League held their annual sessions in the same city and at the same time, passed similar anti-imperialist resolutions, and raised similar slogans.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
THE STATUS OF HINDUS IN AN ISLAMIC STATE
Now I can take up the next NCERT guideline, namely, that historians cannot identify Muslims as rulers and Hindus as subjects, and that the state in medieval India under Muslim rule cannot be described as a theocracy without examining the role of religion in political conflicts.
I will take up the second half of this guideline first.
The modern apologists of Islam have been trying to rescue this “religion” from its macabre record as presented by the medieval Muslim historians.</description>

      <description>I In his utter helplessness and colossal frustration of life Savarkar was striving superhumanly to wring some good out of it. A true ascetic and man of action as he was, he resolved to make the most of life and to make the best of it. Such men of supreme courage and indomitable mil make appearance from age to age. Stone walls do not imprison them, nor do iron bars encage them.</description>

      <description>GIVE up my Jhansi? I will not. Let him try to take who dares!&amp;quot; With this challenge the heroic Ranee of Jhansi rose against the British and as it is recorded in previous parts of this History she assumed the leadership of the Revolution, drove the English and began to rule at Jhansi as the Queen of the province. The forces of the Revolution had wreaked a bloody vengeance on the English people and army and left not a trace of their rule at Sagar.</description>

      <description>ROUND ABOUT AUGUST 15, 1947
The big attacks on the Hindus and Sikhs of Lahore began to be delivered from third June. The destruction wrought in the city was so horrible and appalling that in a desperate effort to save the city from complete devastation a meeting of the three communities was called in the Town Hall on the 27th June. At this meeting, the leaders of the Hindus and Sikhs gave assurances of keeping the peace.</description>

      <description>THE SHIVAJI CELEBRATION Just at this time, the first occasion on which the anniversary of Shivaji&amp;rsquo;s birth was to be celebrated with festivities approached. My brother and myself do not at all like this festival. Such undertakings as involved a great deal of talk highly exasperated us. Besides, some features of the festival held in honour of Shivaji are so extravagant that he himself would not have liked them. In the first place, he would not at all have approved of the custom of celebrating the anniversary of his birth as it was tentamount to placing him on en equal footing with God.</description>

      <description>WHAT effect had this spirit of freedom which inspired life in the dead or dying thrones of Delhi, Cawnpore, Lucknow, and Bareilly on the other states which were still, more or less, living? The mass of the people, in 1857, had thoroughly understood that, so long as foreign domination over Hindusthan remained, the living states were as useless as the dead ones were lifeless. The Revolution in 1857, inspired by the holiest and the highest ideal of freedom, was not fighting furiously for the sake of this king or that heir.</description>

      <description>While the Marathas were thus carrying the War of Hindu Liberation into the very heart of the Mogul empire to free the Hindu land, they were no less strenuously striving to free the Hindu seas too, from the domination of the foreigners that threatened them from the West. They had very early realised that the safety of the Hindu empire was threatened as much by the European mercantile nations that visited their seas, as it was by the Moslems who had already made themselves masters of their lands.</description>

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a fairly large audience at the hall of the Long Island Historical Society, corner Pierrepont and Clinton streets. His subject was &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rsquo;s Gift to the World&amp;rdquo;.
He spoke of the wondrous beauties of his native land, &amp;ldquo;where stood the earliest cradle of ethics, arts, sciences, and literature, and the integrity of whose sons and the virtue of whose daughters have been sung by all travelers.</description>

RIDGELY MANOR,
3rd October, 1899.
MY DEAR MARY,
Thanks for your very kind words. I am much better now and growing so every day. Mrs. Bull and her daughter are expected today or tomorrow. We hope thus to have another spell of good time — you are having yours all the time, of course. I am glad you are going to Philadelphia, but not so much now as then — when the millionaire was on the horizon.</description>

RIDGELY MANOR,
30th October, 1899.
MY DEAR OPTIMIST,
I received your letter and am thankful that something has come to force optimistic laissez faire into action. Your questions have tapped the very source of pessimism, however. British rule in modern India has only one redeeming feature, though unconscious; it has brought India out once more on the stage of the world; it has forced upon it the contact of the outside world.</description>

MY DEAR STURDY,
Your last letter reached me after knocking about a little through insufficient address.
It is quite probable that very much of your criticism is just and correct. It is also possible that some day you may find that all this springs from your dislike of certain persons, and I was the scapegoat.</description>

MY DEAR MRS. BULL,
After all I decide to come to Cambridge just now. I must finish the stories I began. The first one I don&amp;rsquo;t think was given back to me by Margo.
My clothes will be ready the day after tomorrow, and then I shall be ready to start; only my fear is, it will be for the whole winter a place for becoming nervous and not for quieting of nerves, with constant parties and lectures.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
Got some news from Sharat&amp;rsquo;s letter. . . . Get experience while still there is a chance; I am not concerned whether you win or lose. . . . I have no disease now. Again. . . . I am going to tour from place to place. There is no reason for anxiety, be fearless. Everything will fly away before you; only don&amp;rsquo;t be disobedient, and all success will be yours.</description>

Ever your brother,

      <description>CHILD WIDOWS OF INDIA (Daily Eagle, February 27, 1895)
Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, lectured in Historical hall Monday night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical association, on &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rsquo;s Gift to the World&amp;rdquo;. There were about two hundred and fifty people in the hall when the Swami stepped on the platform. Much interest was manifested on account of the denial by Mrs. James McKeen, president of the Brooklyn Ramabai circle, which is interested in Christian work in India, of the statement attributed to the lecture that the child widows of India were not protected [ill-treated].</description>

      <description>*Selections from the Munir Report (1954)*
1) An Islamic State
a.) It has been repeatedly said before us that implicit in the demand for Pakistan was the demand for an Islamic State. Some speeches of important leaders who were striving for Pakistan undoubtedly lend themselves to this construction. These leaders while referring to an Islamic State or to a State governed by Islamic laws perhaps had in their minds the pattern of a legal structure based on or mixed up with Islamic dogma, personal law, ethics, and institutions.</description>

      <description>CLIV To Mrs. Ole Bull
17th January, 1900.
MY DEAR DHIRA MATA,
I received yours with the enclosures for Saradananda; and there was some good news. I hope to get some more news this week. You did not write anything about your plans. I had a letter from Miss Greenstidel expressing her deep gratitude for your kindness — and who does not? Turiyananda is getting well by this time, I hope.</description>

      <description>CLV To Mrs. Ole Bull
LOS ANGELES,
15th February, 1900.
DEAR DHIRA MATA,
Before this reaches you, I am off to San Francisco. You already know all about the work. I have not done much work, but my heart is growing stronger every day, physically and mentally. Some days I feel I can bear everything and suffer everything. There was nothing of note inside the bundle of papers sent by Miss Müller.</description>

      <description>CLVI To Miss Mary Hale
PASADENA,
20th February, 1900.
MY DEAR MARY,
Your letter bearing the sad news of Mr. Hale&amp;rsquo;s passing away reached me yesterday. I am sorry, because in spite of monastic training, the heart lives on; and then Mr. Hale was one of the best souls I met in life. Of course you are sorry, miserable, and so are Mother Church and Harriet and the rest, especially as this is the first grief of its kind you have met, is it not?</description>

DEAR MARY,
Very kind of you to write to invite me to Chicago. I wish I could be there this minute. But I am busy making money; only I do not make much. Well, I have to make enough to pay my passage home at any rate. Here is a new field, where I find ready listeners by hundreds, prepared beforehand by my books.</description>

DEAR DHIRA MATA,
I have not had a word from you for a month. I am in Frisco. The people here have been prepared by my writing beforehand, and they come in big crowds. But it remains to be seen how much of that enthusiasm endures when it comes to paying at the door. Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills invited me to Oakland and gave me big crowds to preach to.</description>

I also learn from Miss Helen that you did not get the stories sent on to you. I am sorry. Margot has copies she may give you. I am so so in health. No money. Hard work. No result. Worse than Los Angeles.
They come in crowds when the lecture is free — when there is payment, they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

b.) The ulama were divided in their opinions when they were asked to cite some precedent of an Islamic State in Muslim history.</description>

      <description>SOME CUSTOMS OF THE HINDUS (Brooklyn Standard Union, April 8, 1895)
A special meeting of the Brooklyn Ethical Association with an address by Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk as the main feature, was held at the Pouch Gallery, of Clinton avenue, last night. &amp;ldquo;Some customs of the Hindus what they mean, and how they are misinterpreted,&amp;rdquo; was the subject treated. A large throng of people filled the spacious gallery.
Dressed in his Oriental costume, his eyes bright, and a flush mantling his face, Swami Vivekananda started to tell of his people, of his country, and its customs.</description>

22nd March, 1900.
MY DEAR MARY,
Many thanks for your kind note. You are correct that I have many other thoughts to think besides Indian people, but they have all to go to the background before the all-absorbing mission — my Master&amp;rsquo;s work.
I would that this sacrifice were pleasant. It is not, and naturally makes one bitter at times; for know, Mary, I am yet a man and cannot wholly forget myself; hope I shall some time.</description>

WELL BLESSED MARY,
This is to let you know &amp;ldquo;I am very happy&amp;rdquo;. Not that I am getting into a shadowy optimism, but my power of suffering is increasing. I am being lifted up above the pestilential miasma of this world&amp;rsquo;s joys and sorrows; they are losing their meaning. It is a land of dreams; it does not matter whether one enjoys or weeps; they are but dreams, and as such, must break sooner or later.</description>

Just a line before you start for France. Are you going via England? I had a beautiful letter from Mrs. Sevier in which I find that Miss Müller sent simply a paper without any other words to Kali who was with her in Darjeeling.
Congreave is the name of her nephew, and he is in the Transvaal war; that is the reason she underlined that, to show her nephew fighting the Boers in Transvaal.</description>

      <description>UNITY, THE GOAL OF RELIGION (Delivered in New York, 1896)
This universe of ours, the universe of the senses, the rational, the intellectual, is bounded on both sides by the illimitable, the unknowable, the ever unknown. Herein is the search, herein are the inquiries, here are the facts; from this comes the light which is known to the world as religion. Essentially, however, religion belongs to the supersensuous and not to the sense plane.</description>

1719 TURK STREET,
SAN FRANCISCO,
10th April, 1900.
DEAR JOE,
There is a squabble in New York, I see. I got a letter from A__ stating that he was going to leave New York. He thought Mrs. Bull and you have written lots against him to me. I wrote him back to be patient and wait, and that Mrs. Bull and Miss MacLeod wrote only good things about him.</description>

      <description>CLXXV To an American friend
ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA,
12th April, 1900.
Mother is becoming propitious once more. Things are looking up. They must.
Work always brings evil with it. I have paid for the accumulated evil with bad health. I am glad. My mind is all the better for it. There is a mellowness and a calmness in life now, which was never there before. I am learning now how to be detached as well as attached, and mentally becoming my own master.</description>

MY DEAR JOE,
Received your note today. I wrote you one yesterday but directed it to England thinking you will be there.
I have given your message to Mrs. Betts. I am so sorry this little quarrel came with A__. I got also his letter you sent. He is correct so far as he says, &amp;ldquo;Swami wrote me &amp;lsquo;Mr. Leggett is not interested in Vedanta and will not help any more.</description>

23rd April, 1900.
MY DEAR MARY,
I ought to have started today but circumstances so happened that I cannot forgo the temptation to be in a camp under the huge red-wood trees of California before I leave. Therefore I postpone it for three or four days. Again after the incessant work I require a breath of God&amp;rsquo;s free air before I start on this bone-breaking journey of four days.</description>

30th April, 1900.
MY DEAR MARY,
Sudden indisposition and fever prevent my starting for Chicago yet. I will start as soon as I am strong for the journey. I had a letter from Margot the other day. Give her kindly my love, and know yourself my eternal love. Where is Harriet? Still in Chicago? And the McKindley sisters? To all my love.

2nd May, 1900.
MY DEAR NIVEDITA,
I have been very ill — one more relapse brought about by months of hard work. Well, it has shown me that I have no kidney or heart disease whatsoever, only overworked nerves. I am, therefore, going today in the country for some days till I completely recover, which I am sure will be in a few days.
In the meanwhile I do not want to read any India letters with the plague news etc.</description>

DEAR NIVEDITA,
All blessings on you. Don&amp;rsquo;t despond in the least. Shri wah Guru! Shri wah Guru! You come of the blood of a Kshatriya. Our yellow garb is the robe of death on the field of battle. Death for the cause is our goal, not success. Shri wah Guru! . . .

MY DEAR MARY,
It is true I am much better, but not yet completely recovered; anyway, the complexion of the mind is one belonging to everyone that suffers. It is neither gas nor anything else.
Kāli worship is not a necessary step in any religion. The Upanishads teach us all there is of religion. Kali worship is my special fad; you never heard me preach it, or read of my preaching it in India.</description>

a.) Legislature in its present sense is unknown to the Islamic system. The religio-political system which is called din-i-Islam is a complete system which contains in itself the mechanism for discovering and applying law to any situation that may arise. During the Islamic Republic there was no legislature in its modern sense; and for every situation or emergency that arose, law could be discovered and applied by the ulama.</description>

      <description>THE FREE SOUL (Delivered in New York, 1896)
The analysis of the Sānkhyas stops with the duality of existence — Nature and souls. There are an infinite number of souls, which, being simple, cannot die, and must therefore be separate from Nature. Nature in itself changes and manifests all these phenomena; and the soul, according to the Sankhyas, is inactive. It is a simple by itself, and Nature works out all these phenomena for the liberation of the soul; and liberation consists in the soul discriminating that it is not Nature.</description>

I have to get the passage and sail. Mother knows the rest.

Kindly write Mohin (Mahendranath Datta, younger brother of Swamiji.) that he has my blessings in whatever he does. And what he is doing now is surely much better than lawyering, etc. I like boldness and adventure and my race stands in need of that spirit very much. Only as my health is failing and I do not expect to live long, Mohin must see his way to take care of mother and family.</description>

      <description>ONE EXISTENCE APPEARING AS MANY (Delivered in New York, 1896)
Vairāgya or renunciation is the turning point in all the various Yogas. The Karmi (worker) renounces the fruits of his work. The Bhakta (devotee) renounces all little loves for the almighty and omnipresent love. The Yogi renounces his experiences, because his philosophy is that the whole Nature, although it is for the experience of the soul, at last brings him to know that he is not in Nature, but eternally separate from Nature.</description>

      <description>*Selections from the Munir Report (1954)*
7) The position of non-Muslims
a.) The ground on which the removal of Chaudhri Zafrullah Khan and other Ahmadis occupying key positions in the State is demanded is that the Ahmadis are non-Muslims; and that therefore, like zimmies in an Islamic State, they are not eligible for appointment to higher offices in the State. This aspect of the demand has directly raised a question about the position of non-Muslims in Pakistan if we are to have an Islamic Constitution.</description>

CXCIV (Translated from the original in French)
To Madame Emma Calve
6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS, PARIS,
October, 1900.
MY DEAR MADEMOISELLE,
I have been very happy and content here. I am having the best of times after many years. I find life here with Mr. Bois very satisfactory — the books, the calm, and the absence of everything that usually troubles me.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of destiny is waiting for me now.</description>

To Sister Christine
6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,
PARIS,
14th October, 1900.
God bless you at each step, my dear Christine, such is my constant prayer!
Your letter, so beautiful and so calm, has given me that fresh energy which I am often losing.
I am happy, yes, I am happy, but the cloud has not left me entirely. It sometimes comes back, unfortunately, but it no longer has the morbidity it used to have.</description>

PORT TEWFICK
26th November, 1900.
DEAR JOE,
The steamer was late; so I am waiting. Thank goodness, it entered the Canal this morning at Port Said. That means it will arrive some time in the evening if everything goes right.
Of course it is like solitary imprisonment these two days, and I am holding my soul in patience.
But they say the change is thrice dear.</description>

MY DEAR MOTHER,
Three days ago I reached here. It was quite unexpected — my visit, and everybody was so surprised.
Things here have gone better than I expected during my absence, only Mr. Sevier has passed away. It was a tremendous blow, sure, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know the future of the work in the Himalayas.</description>

RESPECTED SIR,
I have talked with Pavhari Baba. He is a wonderful saint — the embodiment of humility, devotion, and Yoga. Although he is an orthodox Vaishnava, he is not prejudiced against others of different beliefs. He has tremendous love for Mahāprabhu Chaitanya, and he [Pavhari Baba] speaks of Shri Ramakrishna as &amp;ldquo;an incarnation of God&amp;rdquo;.</description>

I have received your book. In Hrishikesh, Kali [Swami Abhedananda] has had a relapse and is again suffering from what seems to be malaria.

GHAZIPUR
February 1890
RESPECTED SIR,
I have received an anonymous letter which I have been unable to trace back to the gigantic soul who wrote it. Indeed, one should pay homage to such a man. He who considers a great soul like Pavhari Baba to be no more than water in a hoof print, he who has nothing to learn in this world and who feels it a disgrace to be taught by any other man — truly, such a new incarnation must be visited.</description>

A basket of roses will be sent to you in a few days at Chitpur. Do you please send them up immediately to Shashi [Swami Ramakrishnananda, at the Baranagore Math]. They would not be sent to the care of Balaram Basu, for there would be such nice delays and that would be death to the flowers. I think if sent to Chitpur, to your depot, it would reach you there at the very place; if not, write sharp.</description>

I am sorry to learn that [Vaikunthanath] Sanyal&amp;rsquo;s habits are as yet not Pucca [firm]; and what about Brahmacharya? I don&amp;rsquo;t understand you. If so, the best thing for you both is to come down and live here. The widow of Mohindra Mukherjee is trying head and heart to erect a Math for you, and Surendranath Mitra has left another thousand so that you are very likely soon to get a beautiful place on the river.</description>

I am in New York. The gentleman [Dr. Guernsey] whose guest I am is a very nice and learned and well-to-do man. He had an only son whom he lost last July. Has only a daughter now. The old couple have received a great shock, but they are pure and God-loving people and bear it manfully.</description>

DEAR MOTHER,
I just now received your letter. I have the greatest regard for the Salvationists; in fact, they and the Oxford Mission gentlemen are the only Christian missionaries for whom I have any regard at all. They live with the people, as the people, and for the people of India.</description>

10) Jihad
a.) Earlier we have pointed out that one of the doctrines on which the Musalmans and Ahmadis are at variance is that of jihad. This doctrine at once raises a host of other allied matters such as the meanings of ghazi, shahid, jihad.bis-sail, jihad fi sabili&amp;rsquo;llah, dar-ul-Islam, dar-ul-harb, hijrat, ghanima, khums, and slavery, and the conflict or reconciliation of these conceptions with modern international problems such as aggression, genocide, international criminal jurisdiction, international conventions, and rules of public international law.</description>

a.) The ideology on which an Islamic State is desired to be founded in Pakistan must have certain consequences for the Musalmans who are living in countries under non-Muslim sovereigns. We asked Amir-i-Shari&amp;rsquo;at Sayyad Ataullah Shah Bukhari whether a Muslim could be a faithful subject of a non-Muslim State, and reproduce his answer: &amp;ndash;

SPIRITUAL REALISATION, THE AIM OF BHAKTI-YOGA To the Bhakta these dry details are necessary only to strengthen his will; beyond that they are of no use to him. For he is treading on a path which is fitted very soon to lead him beyond the hazy and turbulent regions of reason, to lead him to the realm of realisation. He, soon, through the mercy of the Lord, reaches a plane where pedantic and powerless reason is left far behind, and the mere intellectual groping through the dark gives place to the daylight of direct perception.</description>

DEAR MOTHER
The huge packet received. It was a few pamphlets sent over to me from my monastery in Calcutta. No news at all about the phonograph. I think it is high time we make them inquire into it.
The two volumes of Todd&amp;rsquo;s [Tod&amp;rsquo;s] history of Rajasthan have been presented to me by Mrs.</description>

I have not heard from you a long while. I am still in Boston and will be a few days more.
I am afraid the phonograph has not reached India at all, or something is the matter with it. Kindly ask Mr. —— to inquire.</description>

THE NEED OF GURU Every soul is destined to be perfect, and every being, in the end, will attain the state of perfection. Whatever we are now is the result of our acts and thoughts in the past; and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we think end do now. But this, the shaping of our own destinies, does not preclude our receiving help from outside; nay, in the vast majority of cases such help is absolutely necessary.</description>

      <description>11. THE ROT OF BOLLYWOOD
It is no coincidence that Pakistan, in connivance with Indian Muslims and the covert approval of Saudi Arabia, chose Bombay to plant their deadly bombs after the destruction of the mosque of Ayodhya. For there has always been a strong connection between the Muslims of Bombay, with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, via the film industry (isn’t it, Mr Dilip Kumar?). We all know how Indian actors and actresses used to be invited at Dawood Ibrahim’s parties and today we have discovered how black ‘blood’ money is utilized to finance many of Bollywood mega-films.</description>

Although I did not/do not possess the qualities of a leader, writer or an orator, since then I have contributed to the cause of Hindutva according to my capacity, even at the cost of being teased sarcastically as a Votary.</description>

THE TELE-SERIAL ON TIPU SULTAN
P. PARAMESWARAN
In normal course, Doordarshan should have full freedom to telecast any serial which is not against the interest of the general public. But here, the problem is not a novel. It is the distorted presentation of historical events and historical personalities. In the process of projecting certain people in glorifying terms, an attempt is also being made to deliberately defame certain other people.</description>

A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-1
The Gita has laid down a profound principle in the following words: &amp;ldquo;The person is characterised by his credo. Whatever is a person&amp;rsquo;s credo, that he is.&amp;rdquo;
And a person&amp;rsquo;s credo can be identified not so much in the words he speaks or writes as in the actions that flow freely out of him. The speaker or the writer who fails to act in terms of the faith he propounds in his speeches and writings is no more than a sophist who may be successful with some people or for some time but who is sure to be found out sooner or later.</description>

      <description>10. Are Buddhists Hindus?
10.1. A polemic and a high-brow debate
Now that Christians have started talking about “Jesus the Jew”, it is to be expected that Hindus and Buddhists should explore the notion “Buddha the Hindu”, or at least to highlight the Hindu foundations on which the Buddha built. It is now fairly widely accepted that Jesus was a millennarist cult leader inside the Jewish fold who did not conceive of his own message and mission as a new religion; the question may be asked whether the Buddha was not likewise an innovator within the Hindu tradition.</description>

      <description>10. Secularism as it is 10.1. Its definition To start with the beginning, Indian secularism was borrowed from Europe. There, secularism meant that society took the freedom to organize itself without caring about the dogmas of the Churches. At the intellectual level, it meant that thinkers took the freedom to independently formulate insights regardless of their conformity with Church teachings. This included the freedom to frontally criticize these Church teachings.</description>

 A symptom of the ideological power equation is the Sangh  Parivar&amp;rsquo;s permanent checkmate in the &amp;ldquo;war of the words&amp;rdquo;. The Sangh is at the mercy of the meanings which its enemies allot to important terms, such as &amp;ldquo;communalism&amp;rdquo;.
 Originally (at least in Indian politics), &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; was the  term by which the British labelled political arrangements, such as separate electorates and quota-based recruitment, which took the religious community as the operative unit rather than the individual or the family or the region or the nation.</description>

The generosity shown by the Prophet to his kinsmen at Mecca was not matched by anything in relation to the Jews of Medina, nor, for the matter of that, to any Jewish tribe of Arabia.

Encounter in Maharashtra
Another dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity was held soon after the one in Calcutta. This time the venue was Bombay, the second most important city founded by the British and another storm centre of missionary activity against Hinduism. John Wilson, after whom the Wilson College in Bombay is named, was an important Presbyterian missionary from Scotland. He “debated for six successive evenings with a pandit named Morabhatta Dandekara” in February, 1831.</description>

      <description>AMRITSAR
In the history of the Muslim League War on the Hindus and Sikhs of the Punjab in 1947, Amritsar occupies an outstanding position. It was in this city, along with Lahore, though with an intensity even greater than in the latter town, that the most sustained war, lasting for over five months was waged on the Hindus and Sikhs, especially the latter, by the Amritsar Muslims. In the scheme of the Muslim League, Amritsar appears to have been Theatre of War No.</description>

      <description>A few extracts from the Judgment of the Special Tribunal in the case of Mr. Savarkar which resulted in his conviction.
 “The case for the prosecution is that we have here to deal with certain members of a revolutionary conspiracy existing in Nashik, Bombay, Pen, Poona, Yeola, Aurangabad and other places in the Deccan, the activities of which were directly by the energy of Vinayak Savarkar towards political assassination by means of pistols and explosives.</description>

THE first point to be borne in mind by our brothers and sisters living abroad is to keep alive their day-to-day behaviour a spirit of intense national self-respect. And for this, a keen awareness of the glorious heritage that our forbears have left for us should ever be present in our minds.</description>

Interview with Father Bruno Barnhardt
Emmaculate Heart Hermitage
Father Barnhardt is a member of the same Catholic order-the Camaldolese Monks-as Father Bede Griffiths and has spent time at the Shantivanam Ashram. He shared some of his observations with Hinduism Today:
*Q. What is your observation on how Shantivanam has been successful as a means of conveying the Catholic message to the Indian people?
*A. For a long while for Catholicism to go into another country it would mean to bring some kind of European culture and implant it on top of the indigenous culture.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6
Factors which Checked Islamization of India
Now, if the components of growth of Muslim population were many, Muslim losses comparatively few, and fecundity among them high, the problem that needs investigation is why Muslims have remained a minority in this country and why India, unlike many other countries in the medieval period, could not be completely converted to Islam.
Vastness of the Country
The vastness of the country and its natural and political division into regions and kingdoms made the task of its complete subjugation and conversion extremely difficult.</description>

THE PETITION HAS SERVED A GREAT PURPOSE
By filing the Writ Petition for a ban on the Quran, Chandmal Chopra has invited attention to a subject which Hindus have neglected for long and at great cost to themselves. They have yet to examine critically the claim of the Quran as a sacred scripture and of Islam as a religion. If Hindus now take up this study in all seriousness and educate themselves about the character of Islam, the Petition will have served its purpose.</description>

GHILMANS AND EUNUCHS
The treatment meted out to the slaves depended upon the temperament, whim and caprice of the master. Some masters were kind hearted and treated their slaves kindly, many others cruelly, a few abominably. But one class of slaves who were very well looked after were ghilman and mamalik. The eunuchs also, because of the nature of their duties, received sort of a special treatment.

Let the Mute Witnesses Speak
Sita Ram Goel
The cradle of Hindu culture^(1) on the eve of its Islamic invasion included what are at present the Sinkiang province of China, the Transoxiana region of Russia, the Seistan province of Iran and the sovereign states of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The Islamic invasion commenced around 650 A.D., when a Muslim army secured a foothold in Seistan, and continued till the end of the eighteenth century, when the last Islamic crusader, Tipu Sultan, was overthrown by the British.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TEN
THE PRE-ISLAMIC ARABS
Muslim theologians and historians present a pretty dark picture of pre-Islamic Arabia. Its people, we are told, were unrepentant pagans and polytheists unware of the Unity of God and the succession of his Prophets. They believed that Allãh, the one and only True God, stood in need of partners who could mediate between him and his creatures. Worse still, they gave daughters to Allãh while they preferred sons for themselves.</description>

OF ASSIMILATION AND SYNTHESIS
Another major NCERT guideline regarding writing of medieval Indian history is that “neglect and omission of trends and processes of assimilation and synthesis, and growth of a composite culture” is “prejudicial to national integration”.
The right hand does not know what the left hand has done. First, we are told not to treat the Islamic invaders as foreigners. Next, we are asked not to neglect trends and processes of assimilation and synthesis.</description>

THE BEHAVIOUR PATTERN PATENTED BY ISLAM
On August 4, 1920, Mahatma Gandhi had written as follows in his Young India: “My advice to my Hindu brethren is: Simply help the Mussalmans in their sorrow in a generous and self-sacrificing spirit without counting the cost and you will automatically save the cow… Islam is a noble faith. Trust it and its followers. We must hold it a crime for any Hindu to talk to them about cow-protection or any other help in our religious matters, while the Khilafat struggle is going on.</description>

      <description>OUR HATRED OF THE ENGLISH In the meanwhile we again tried to get ourselves enlisted in a regiment, but failed. This was the last disappointment suffered by us and we strongly reviled the English as follows : &amp;quot; A system of administration so cruel as that of the English cannot, if search be made, be found, in any region of this globe. Far better were the tyrannical Yavan kings, who, with sword in hand, actually cut the throats of men as if they were so many goats.</description>

      <description>But splendid as these successes in the Konkan were, the Maratha arms were prevailing elsewhere as splendidly. Bajirao after the conquest and stttlement of Gujarat, Malva and Bundelkhand and thus extending the power of the Hindu Empire up to the Chambal, was not likely to cry halt there for ever. His aim was a consolidated Hindu Empire that should embrace all Hindustan in its sweep. His anxiety was to see all the religious shrines of Hindus freed and cleansed from being polluted by the alien and faithless touch of the enemies of Hindu Dharma.</description>

The World War I terminated in 1918 and soon after a systematic and persistent propaganda was carried on through- out the country for the release of all political prisoners. People, popular leaders and the Press voiced their demand for the release of political prisoners through petitions, meet- ings, Conferences, Congress Sessions and in Coimcils. The National Union of Bombay, Sri Anantrao Gadre, Senapati Bapat and Sri Shivrampant Paranjpe took a leading part in collecting signatures of the people on the petition and the great petition was forwarded to Mr.</description>

      <description>The reaction against universal tendencies of Buddhism only grew more insistent and powerful as the attempt to re-establish the Buddhist power in India began to assume a more threatening attitude. Nationalist tendencies refused to barter with out national independence and accept a foreign conqueror as our overlord. But if that foreign invader happened to be favourably inclined towards Buddhism, then he was sure to find some secret sympathisers among the Indian Buddhists all over Indian, even as Catholic Spain could always find some important section in England to sympathise with their efforts to restore a Catholic dynasty in England.</description>

In view of the long and frequent discussions Khwaja Nazim-ud-Din had with the ulama, the correctness and justification of the demands on theological grounds must have been discussed.</description>

I do not know what to do. I send you therefore back this notice, and if they deliver it to you, all right — else I hope you will ask them to send it over to New York and kindly give them my address.
Yours obediently,

Many, many thanks for sending the coat. Now I am well equipped for summer. I am so sorry the rugs could not come before I leave this country. They will come if Dewanji is alive.

DEAR MOTHER,
Your kind note duly reached. The books have arrived safe and more are coming. The Sanskrit books pay no duty, being classics. I expect a big package from Khetri. The big packet was from the Raja of Khetri, sending me an address from a meeting held of Rajput nobility at Mount Abu, for my work in this country.</description>

INCARNATE TEACHERS AND INCARNATION Wherever His name is spoken, that very place is holy. How much more so is the man who speaks His name, and with what veneration ought we to approach that man out of whom comes to us spiritual truth! Such great teachers of spiritual truth are indeed very few in number in this world, but the world is never altogether without them. They are always the fairest flowers of human life — अहेतुकदयासिन्धुः — &amp;ldquo;the ocean of mercy without any motive&amp;rdquo;.</description>

You did not write to me a single line for a long time. Neither did Sister Mary write about the duty paid on the rugs [from the Dewan of Junagadh]. I am afraid the rugs are small.

They will be here by the middle of this month. And if you see a letter with the Morris American Express Co. name on the envelope, tear it open. You need not forward it to me, for that will be the notice of arrival to Chicago. I am sure Dewanji&amp;rsquo;s carpets were too small, but why do you not write to me about the duty if you had to pay it?</description>

THE MANTRA: OM: WORD AND WISDOM But we are now considering not these Mahā-purushas, the great Incarnations, but only the Siddha-Gurus (teachers who have attained the goal); they, as a rule, have to convey the germs of spiritual wisdom to the disciple by means of words (Mantras) to be meditated upon. What are these Mantras? The whole of this universe has, according to Indian philosophy, both name and form (Nāma-Rupa) as its conditions of manifestation.</description>

DEAR CHRISTINA,
I am once more on American Soil and have taken lodgings at 228 W. 39, where I begin work from Monday next. Sometime after Christmas I intend to make a tour through Detroit and Chicago.
I do not care for public lecturings at all — and do not think I shall have any more public lectures charging admission.</description>

Perhaps by this time you have received my first letter. I received yours just now.
I had a splendid success in England and have left a nucleus there to work till my arrival next summer. You will be astonished to learn that some of my strongest friends are big &amp;ldquo;guns&amp;rdquo; of the Church of England.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
WORSHIP OF SUBSTITUTES AND IMAGES The next points to be considered are the worship of Pratikas or of things more or less satisfactory as substitutes for God, and the worship of Pratimās or images. What is the worship of God through a Pratika? It is अब्रह्मणि ब्रह्मदृष्ट्याऽनुसन्धानम् — Joining the mind with devotion to that which is not Brahman, taking it to be Brahman&amp;quot; — says Bhagavān Rāmānuja. &amp;ldquo;Worship the mind as Brahman this is internal; and the Âkāsha as Brahman, this is with regard to the Devas&amp;rdquo;, says Shankara.</description>

Many thanks for your kindly sending me several copies of the Light of the East. I wish the paper all success.
As you have asked for my suggestion [that] I can make towards improving the paper — I must frankly state that in my life-long experience in the work, I have always found &amp;ldquo;Occultism&amp;rdquo; injurious and weakening to humanity.</description>

I want to finish some text books to be the basis of work when I am gone. I want to hurry through four little text books before I go.</description>

THE CHOSEN IDEAL The next thing to be considered is what we know as Ishta-Nishthā. One who aspires to be a Bhakta must know that &amp;ldquo;so many opinions are so many ways&amp;rdquo;. He must know that all the various sects of the various religions are the various manifestations of the glory of the same Lord. &amp;ldquo;They call You by so many names; they divide You, as it were, by different names, yet in each one of these is to be found Your omnipotence&amp;hellip;.</description>

63, ST. GEORGE&amp;rsquo;S-ROAD, S.W.
SIR,
Allow me to put a few words in your estimable journal as comments on an article in your paper dated July 4th. I must thank you without reserve for the kind and friendly spirit manifested throughout the article towards me and the philosophy I preach; but, as there is a fear of misconstruction in one part of it — especially by my Spiritualistic friends — I want to clear my position.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
THE METHOD AND THE MEANS In regard to the method and the means of Bhakti-Yoga we read in the commentary of Bhagavan Ramanuja on the Vedanta-Sutras: &amp;ldquo;The attaining of That comes through discrimination, controlling the passions, practice, sacrificial work, purity, strength, and suppression of excessive joy.&amp;rdquo; Viveka or discrimination is, according to Ramanuja, discriminating, among other things, the pure food from the impure. According to him, food becomes impure from three causes: (1) by the nature of the food itself, as in the case of garlic etc.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED,
Surrounded on all sides by eternal snow peaks, sitting on the grass in a beautiful wood, my thoughts go to those I love — so I write.
I am in Switzerland — constantly on the move — getting a much needed rest. It is a miniature Himalayas, and has the same effect of raising the mind up to the Self and driving away all earthly feelings and ties.</description>

GENTLEMEN,
I have received your address with great pleasure and sincerely thank you for the kind expressions contained therein.
I much regret, however, that time effectually prevents my paying even a short visit to Trichinopoly at present. In the autumn, however, I propose making a lecture tour throughout India, and you may rely upon it that I shall then not fail to include Trichinopoly in the programme.</description>

DEAR CHRISTINA,
Many, many thanks for the photograph and the poem. I never saw anything half as beautiful. The work I had to do to reach Calcutta from Ceylon was so immense that I could not earlier acknowledge your precious gift. The work has broken me down completely, and I have got &amp;ldquo;diabetes&amp;rdquo;, an incurable disease, which must carry me off — at least in a few years.</description>

THE PREPARATORY RENUNCIATION We have now finished the consideration of what may be called the preparatory Bhakti, and are entering on the study of the Parā-Bhakti or supreme devotion. We have to speak of a preparation to the practice of this Para-Bhakti. All such preparations are intended only for the purification of the soul. The repetition of names, the rituals, the forms, and the symbols, all these various things are for the purification of the soul.</description>

CIX To Lala Badri Sah of Almora
DARJEELING
7th April &amp;lsquo;97.
DEAR LALAJEE,
Just received your kind invitation through telegram. Perhaps you have already heard that I have been attacked by &amp;ldquo;Diabetes&amp;rdquo;, a fell disease.
That unsettled all our plans, and I had to run up to Darjeeling, it being very cool and very good for the disease.</description>

Thursday, [June 1897]
DEAR BADRI SAH,
I have been very sorry to learn that you are not well. It would please me very much if you would come down here for a few days, at any rate, with us; and I am sure it would do you good.
Yours with blessings,

I haven&amp;rsquo;t received any word of your arrival yet. I heard that Alasinga has gone there with his relations by way of Jaipur. We stayed at the Binsar Dak Bungalow [rest-house] for two or three days, and then I left for Shyamdhura. At this, Miss [Henrietta] Müller got infuriated and left for Almora. Terribly upset, Miss Müller accused Shivananda of telling her first that I shall live with a friend as his guest and of renting later such a big house for the season at 80 rupees without consulting her.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
THE BHAKTA&amp;rsquo;S RENUNCIATION RESULTS FROM LOVE We see love everywhere in nature. Whatever in society is good and great and sublime is the working out of that love; whatever in society is very bad, nay diabolical, is also the ill-directed working out of the same emotion of love. It is this same emotion that gives us the pure and holy conjugal love between husband and wife as well as the sort of love which goes to satisfy the lowest forms of animal passion.</description>

I am afraid you are getting roasted down there in the heat of Calcutta. Here it is nice and cool and rather chill when it rains, which it does almost every day.

With infinite sorrow I learn the sad news of Mr. Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s departure from this life, the more so as it was terribly sudden and therefore prevented all possibilities of my being at his side at the time of death.

      <description>CHAPTER IV
THE FORMS OF LOVE — MANIFESTATION Here are some of the forms in which love manifests itself. First there is reverence. Why do people show reverence to temples and holy places? Because He is worshipped there, and His presence is associated with all such places. Why do people in every country pay reverence to teachers of religion? It is natural for the human heart to do so, because all such teachers preach the Lord.</description>

CXXXI To Sister Nivedita
[Early 1899?]
MY DEAR NIVEDITA,
The address of my cousin is 127 Manicktala Street. The husband&amp;rsquo;s name is Durga Prasanna Bose. The wife&amp;rsquo;s name is most probably not known to the people you will meet in the male department. Therefore it is the custom to ask for the wife of so-and-so.
Manicktala Street is that which runs east and west, south of the tank garden.</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
Excuse this long delay in replying to your very beautiful note. The fact is, I was once more in the vale of death. The old diabetes has now disappeared. In its place has come what some doctors call asthma, others dyspepsia, owing to nervous prostration.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER V
UNIVERSAL LOVE AND HOW IT LEADS TO SELF-SURRENDER How can we love the Vyashti, the particular, without first loving the Samashti, the universal? God is the Samashti, the generalised and the abstract universal whole; and the universe that we see is the Vyashti, the particularised thing. To love the whole universe is possible only by way of loving the Samashti — the universal — which is, as it were, the one unity in which are to be found millions and millions of smaller unities.</description>

Our stay in England will not be long, I am afraid, as this is neither the season nor am I in fit condition to work much. Anyhow, we will be in London a few weeks — at least myself — then go to the U.</description>

India is also the opposite of whatever it should be: so much appears to have gone wrong in this country, everything has been perverted. And if we had to name the horror that is India, we would say: the VIP culture; Delhi an arrogant, superficial and polluted city; tourism where the foreigner is a cow to be milked by the Government; there are also much more than one billion human beings in India, whatever the Official census says; and finally, India might be going towards an ecological pralaya –a and nobody in this country gives a damn, certainly not the NGO’s who are too busy making money out of India’s poverty.</description>

 I am in receipt of the booklet detailing two documents of Dr. Shreerang Godbole. I am grateful for the same. My response on these two documents is as under:
It is evident that ‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’ is launched because a new avenue is being sought in order to frame a policy in respect of the Muslim question in the Indian polity.
It is rather an approach - an approach to be in touch of the Muslim community so that the political untouchability towards BJP propagated by the Secularists can be overcome.</description>

A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-2
Ever since Pandit Nehru visited the United States of America for the first time in 1949 and the U.S. Administration discovered that it was impossible to have a free and frank discussion with him regarding concrete policies, a horde of U.S. specialists and psychologists have been in and out of India for a &amp;ldquo;fuller understanding of Jawaharlal Nehru, India&amp;rsquo;s man of destiny&amp;rdquo;. They have studied his life story exhaustively and brooded for years over his least little idiosyncrasy.</description>

Encounter with Sariskrit Pandits
Yet another dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity was held from 1839 to 1845. It is particularly interesting because it took place through the medium of Sanskrit. John Muir (1810-1882) published the first draft of his MataparikshA in 1839 and the final in 1840. It drew three rejoinders from Hindu Pandits. SomanAtha, whose real name was Subaji Bapu, published his MatataparIkshAsikshA in 1839. Harachandra TarkapañchAnana came out with his MataparIkshottara in 1840.</description>

11.1. The challenge of Ambedkarite neo-Buddhism
On 2 October 1956, two months before his death, the former Law Minister Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar led several hundreds of thousands of followers, mostly belonging to his own ex-untouchable Mahar caste, into conversion to Buddhism.^(1) He extracted twenty-two promises from his followers. We will list them here with their original numbers but regrouped in two categories. The first category consists of positive expressions of commitment to the Buddhist way:</description>

The riots 11.1 Reporting vs. comment &amp;ldquo;The &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; people in this country show a remarkable eagerness to see communalism even in the most harmless observations of [Hindu] religious leaders, while overlooking such outrageously communal and provocative statements as the one made by the former government official Syed Shahabuddin, that contact with the Hindus debased the Muslim, or the one by Syed Abdullah Bukhari, the Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, that the Muslims would resort to a civil war.</description>

      <description>12. Vulgar nationalism
 A consequence of this lack of self-developed understanding of  the forces in the field is that the Sangh is not able to discern objective allies and enemies on the world stage, so that it is unable to make friends. E.g., after liberalization and globalization became hot items, the Sangh Parivar including the BJP has been multiplying and intensifying its attacks on the USA. Time and again, Hindutva spokesmen have been presenting the impersonal process of globalization as an American ploy to take over the world (just as Westerners once depicted earlier developments in capitalism as Jewish conspiracies to dispossess the workers and smallholders).</description>

**Plunder (Ghanîmah) in Jihãd: **
The Evidence of the Sunnah
Did the Prophet appropriate plunder (ghanîmah) for his own use? The relevant Revelations and ahãdîs have already been discussed in detail, and the part of Khums, the holy one-fifth of the plunder in the Islamic scheme of things, analysed threadbare. But here again the Prophet’s own practice (Sunnah) has to be mentioned if only to round off the discussion. A proper analysis of this single topic would require a whole book; here I shall content myself with a bare outline.</description>

      <description>Appendix
Using the Babari Masjid-Ramajanmabhumi controversy as a pretext, Muslim mobs went on a rampage all over Bangladesh. They attacked and burnt down Hindu houses and business establishments in many places, murdered some Hindus and inflicted injuries on many others. Hindu temples and monasteries invited their special attention everywhere.
Starting on October 29, 1989, the mob fury reached its climax on November 9 and 10 after the Shilanyas ceremony at Ayodhya.</description>

A CLOSE LOOK AT ALLAH OF THE QURAN
The one name which Muslims hate and fear most is that of Chengiz Khan. He is a spectre which has haunted Muslim historians for centuries. He swept like a tornado over the then most powerful and extensive Islamic empire of Khwarazm. In a short span of five years (1219-1224 CE), he slaughtered millions of Muslims, forced many others including women and children into slavery, and razed to the ground quite a few of the most populous and prosperous cities of the Muslim world at that time.</description>

RELIGION OF PAGAN ARABIA
The Islamic sources do tell us that the pre-Islamic Arabs were mushriks (polytheists) “addicted” to worshipping numerous idols. But they do not inform us as to what those idols symbolized. The Qur’ãn (2.257, 259; 4.52; 53.19; 71.21) mentions some idols but only to denounce them. We reproduce below what Ibn Ishãq writes about them:
“They say that the beginning of stone worship among the sons of Ishmael was when Mecca became too small for them and they wanted more room in the country.</description>

SLAVE TRADE
It is nowhere mentioned in medieval chronicles how slaves, captured in war, were sorted out and separated for the purpose of being sold, drafted into the army, given as gifts to princes and nobles or set apart for domestic service. All that is known is that slaves were disposed of on all these counts and many more. It appears that the sorting was done on the basis of the looks of the females, physical fitness of the males, intuition of the master, as well as the specific work that a slave was deemed fit to do.</description>

Shri H.V. Seshadri has taken The Tragic Story of Partition to its fatal finale in 1947. Each of his chapters is packed with facts, insights, and interpretations such as make his book a substantial contribution to the large literature on this controversial subject. The only drawback in this otherwise well-documented study is the frequent absence of dates on which the books from which he has quoted were published, and the statements of leaders he has cited were made.</description>

      <description>And thus we find that institutions that were the peculiar marks of our nation were revived: - The system of four varnas which could not be wiped away even under the Buddhistic sway, grew in popularity to such an extent that kings and emperors felt it a distinction to be called one who established the system of four varnas. Reaction in favour of this institution grew so strong that our nationality was almost getting identified with it.</description>

It braced them up to sterner efforts and greater achievements under their new leader Balaji, alias Nana Saheb- the son of Baji Rao, and Bhau Saheb-the son of Chimaji, the victor of Bassein. Although he was only 19, Balaji had already seen service under his father and proved to be capable of the leadership of a great people.</description>

Returning to the Hindu Fold
A Primer
What can a person do who finds himself a Catholic and wants to rejoin the Hindu faith of his ancestors? He need not wait until another incarnation, for his situation admits of a fairly simple solution-formal apostacy (&amp;ldquo;abandonment&amp;rdquo; from Catholicism, and readmission to the Hindu fold). Hindu religious leaders have always taken a liberal view of the return of converts to other faiths.</description>

Thus Savarkar was interned in Ratnagiri where the defeated and dethroned King Theba of Burma had perished. Two weeks after this memorable event of January 6, 1924, the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha was established ostensibly through the influence and attempts of Babarao Savarkar, but, in fact, inspired by Savarkar himself. The main object of the Sabha was to organize, consolidate and unite the Hindus into one organic whole and enable them to oppose effectively any unjust aggression ; thus while protecting their own cultural, religious and economic rights, the Hindus were to strive for the general welfare of mankind, universal compassion being the basic urge of Hinduism !</description>

Sheikhupura is the district next to Lahore on the Western side. Just three miles out of Lahore, after crossing the River Ravi, one enters the boundary of this district. This district contains Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Sri Guru Nanak Dev, and the huge estate attached to this Gurdwara which before partition yielded a revenue of about twenty lakh rupees annually to the Sikh people. Most of the proprietors of land in this district were Sikhs who had fine lands and had made them rich and productive by lavishing on this land such hard labour as only the Sikh agriculturist appears to be capable of.</description>

CL To Sister Christine
RIDGELY MANOR,
4th November 1899.
MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
The letter was all right in reaching. It was only my nervousness. I am sure you will understand and excuse this. I eagerly expect t o see you in Cambridge. I am going to New York next week. Thence I go for a few days to Washington and then to Cambridge.</description>

NEW YORK,

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
I received your letter just now. I am now in New York. Dr. [Egbert] Guernsey analysed my urine yesterday, and there was no sugar or albumen in it. So my kidneys are all right, at least at present. The heart is only nervous, requires calming!</description>

12th November 1899.
CHRISTINA —
Mrs. Bull has gone to Boston without seeing me. I am with the Guernseys. All today laid up with colds.
Oh, these nasty colds. The doctor here declares my case as entirely one of nervous exhaustion. Even the dyspepsia is entirely nervous.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL —
I am laid up with a bad cold. The clothes are not ready — they will be next week. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what my next step will be. Dr. Guernsey is very kind. Several Doctors have examined me and none could detect any organic disease.</description>

21 WEST 34TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
21st November 1899.
MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
Circumstances have so fallen that I have to start for California tomorrow. It is for my physical benefit too; as the doctor says, I had better be off where the severe winter of the North cannot reach.
Well, thus my plans are made and marred.</description>

They have been very kind. Madame [Emma] Calvé‚ came to see me day before yesterday. She is a great woman.
I have nothing to write here except that Margo [Sister Nivedita] is doing very well, except some people were complaining last night that she frightened them with her assertion that Swami can not make mistakes!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
THE TRIANGLE OF LOVE We may represent love as a triangle, each of the angles of which corresponds to one of its inseparable characteristics. There can be no triangle without all its three angles; and there can be no true love without its three following characteristics. The first angle of our triangle of love is that love knows no bargaining. Wherever there is any seeking for something in return, there can, be no real love; it becomes a mere matter of shop-keeping.</description>

THE CALIFORNIA LIMITED
SANTA FE ROUTE
December 2nd, 1899
MY DEAR MARGOT,
Two nights are passed — today the third will come. If it proves as pleasant and somnolent as the last two, I [shall] rejoice.
The scenery today I am passing through is much like the neighborhood of Delhi, the beginning of a big desert, bleak hills, scanty, thorny shrubs, very little water.</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
After all, it is good for me, and good for those I love, that I should come here. Here at last in California! One of our poets says: &amp;ldquo;Where is Benares, where is Kashmir, where Khorasan, where Gujarat! O Tulsi! thus, man&amp;rsquo;s past Karma drags him on&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DEAR CHRISTINA,
So you are awake and can&amp;rsquo;t go to sleep any more. Good! Keep awake, wide awake. It was good I came here. For, in the first place, I am cured. What do you think of this — able to walk, and every day walk three miles after a heavy dinner!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VIII
THE GOD OF LOVE IS HIS OWN PROOF What is the ideal of the lover who has quite passed beyond the idea of selfishness, of bartering and bargaining, and who knows no fear? Even to the great God such a man will say, &amp;ldquo;I will give You my all, and I do not want anything from You; indeed there is nothing that I can call my own.&amp;rdquo; When a man has acquired this conviction, his ideal becomes one of perfect love, one of perfect fearlessness of love.</description>

CLXXII To Sister Christine
VEDANTA SOCIETY,
102 EAST 58TH STREET,
NEW YORK,
13th June 1900.
DEAR CHRISTINA,
There is no cause for any anxiety. As I wrote, I am healthier than ever; moreover, all the past fear of kidney troubles has passed away. &amp;ldquo;Worry&amp;rdquo; is the only disease I have, and I am conquering it fast.
I will be here a week or two, and then I come to Detroit.</description>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,
I am getting better every day, only this New York is a bad place for sleep. Again, I am working some, though not hard, to get the old friends together and put the thing in shape.
Now, you know, I will in a week or so finish this work and then be ready for a real quiet of a week or two or more.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER IX
HUMAN REPRESENTATIONS OF THE DIVINE IDEAL OF LOVE It is impossible to express the nature of this supreme and absolute ideal of love in human language. Even the highest flight of human imagination is incapable of comprehending it in all its infinite perfection and beauty. Nevertheless, the followers of the religion of love, in its higher as well as its lower forms, in all countries, have all along had to use the inadequate human language to comprehend and to define their own ideal of love.</description>

MY DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH —
This is to introduce Swami Turiyananda. The lady who gave the piece of land for Vedanta work belongs to Los Angeles. She has taken Turiyananda with her. He is a great spiritual teacher — but has no experience in platform work.
The best thing would be to help him to start a centre for quiet and rest and meditation in the land near San Jose.</description>

CONCLUSION When this highest ideal of love is reached, philosophy is thrown away; who will then care for it? Freedom, Salvation, Nirvāna — all are thrown away; who cares to become free while in the enjoyment of divine love? &amp;ldquo;Lord, I do not want wealth, nor friends, nor beauty, nor learning, nor even freedom; let me be born again and again, and be Thou ever my Love.

GAUHATI
April 17, 1901
I have great pleasure in certifying the great amiability and helpfulness of the brothers Shivakanta and Lakshmikanta, Pandas of Shri Kamakhya Peetham.
They are men who help most and are satisfied with the least.
I can unhesitatingly recommend them to the Hindu public visiting this most holy shrine.

REVERED SIR,
We, the inhabitants of Jaffna professing the Hindu religion, desire to offer you a most hearty welcome to our land, the chief centre of Hinduism in Ceylon, and to express our thankfulness for your kind acceptance of our invitation to visit this part of Lanka.
Our ancestors settled here from Southern India, more than two thousand years ago, and brought with them their religion, which was patronised by the Tamil kings of Jaffna; but when their government was displaced by that of the Portuguese and the Dutch, the observance of religious rites was interfered with, public religious worship was prohibited, and the Sacred Temples, including two of the most far-famed Shrines, were razed to the ground by the cruel hand of persecution.</description>

DEAR JOE —
I received a note yesterday from Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo]. They have seen Agra on their way to Gwalior. They must be there now.
The wire he sent to Japan was to Mr. [Tokuno] Oda to come immediately. There was a work. &amp;ldquo;Six&amp;rdquo; in it also.</description>

      <description>REPLY TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME AT PAMBAN On the arrival of Swami Vivekananda at Pamban, he was met by His Highness the Raja of Ramnad, who accorded him a hearty welcome. Preparations had been made at the landing wharf for a formal reception; and here, under a pandal which had been decorated with great taste, the following address on behalf of the Pamban people was read:

I would, therefore, suggest that you start after breakfast and remain the day here and have some Bengalee fish lunch, and go back in the evening.

It is in love that religion exists and not in ceremony, in the pure and sincere love in the heart. Unless a man is pure in body and mind, his coming into a temple and worshipping Shiva is useless.</description>

The following lecture was delivered at Cambridge, December 17, 1894, and recorded by Miss Frances Willard’s stenographer.
Swami Vivekananda faced bigotry in America on several issues of Indian culture — one was the Indian woman. Naturally he sought to correct Western misconceptions. When he lectured in his own country, however, there was no greater advocate for improving the life of Indian women than the Swami.</description>

We know that all these ideas of worship are right and all good, and we have seen that the worship of God, and God alone, is Bhakti.</description>

Unfortunately the Swami was not always accompanied by a professional stenographer who could keep pace with the exceptional speed of his extempore deliveries. However, a few students managed to take notes of some lectures and classes, which are today the only available records of works that would otherwise have been lost to the world.</description>

Everything progresses in waves. The march of civilization, the progression of worlds, is in waves. All human activities likewise progress in waves — art, literature, science, religion.
Great waves succeed each other, and between these great waves is a quiet, a calm, a period of rest, a period of recuperation.</description>

The first point is the position. Sit with the spine perfectly free, with the weight resting on the hips. The next step is breathing. Breathe in the left nostril and out the right. Fill the lungs full and eject all the breath.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s notes of a Bhagavad-Gitā class delivered Thursday, May 24, 1900, in San Francisco, California]
The Gitā is the gist of the Vedas. It is not our Bible; the Upanishads are our Bible. It [the Gita] is the gist of the Upanishads and harmonizes the many contradictory parts of the Upanishads.
The Vedas are divided into two portions — the work portion and the knowledge portion.</description>

[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel&amp;rsquo;s random lecture notes, most of which seem to pertain to chapter two of the Bhagavad-Gitā]
&amp;ldquo;Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone.&amp;rdquo;
The first discourse in the Gita can be taken allegorically.
&amp;ldquo;The Vedas only teach of things in nature, only teach of nature.&amp;rdquo;
We are always letting sentiment usurp the place of duty, and flattering ourselves that we are acting in response to true love.</description>

This article first appeared anonymously in the February 1895 issue of the New York Medical Times, a prestigious monthly medical journal founded and edited by Dr. Egbert Guernsey.
Classification or grouping of phenomena by their similarities is the first step in scientific knowledge — perhaps it is all. An organized grouping, revealing to us a similarity running through the whole group, and a conviction that under similar circumstances the group will arrange itself in the same form — stretched over all time, past, present and future — is what we call law.</description>

After his experience of the macrocosm within the microcosm while absorbed in meditation under the peepul tree at Kakrighat, in 1890, Swami Vivekananda jotted down in Bengali fragments of his realization in his notebook.
In the beginning was the Word etc.
The microcosm and the macrocosm are built on the same plan. Just as the individual soul is encased in the living body, so is the universal Soul in the Living Prakriti [Nature] — the objective universe.</description>

      <description>13. THE HIDDEN TREASURES
If only India knew the treasure trove hidden in her midst! There is a knowledge here, which has been lost to the world; there is a spiritual fervor in this country, which is found nowhere in this degree on this planet; there is a diversity of cultural and social expression in India, which is unique in an increasingly unipolar world. We have chosen four stories to illustrate this point: pranayama the science of breathing; the astounding festival of Ayappa; kalaripayat, the ancestor of all great Asian martial arts; and the jallikatu festival in Madurai.</description>

      <description>10. Jitendra D. Desai
 FIRST DOCUMENT:
1. What is the harm in adding Jesus and Muhammad to the 33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses?
Response: What is the need? Why do we want to add two more gods to 33 crore gods and goddesses? Is this a genuine desire to assimilate two communities following two Semitic religions?
In my opinion, the Sangh leadership is guided by BJP leadership, which in turn is guided by desire to achieve political supremacy at any cost, and this desire (of political power at any cost) has brought down the BJP leadership to the lowly depths of electoral arithmetic - votes count, votes of Christians and Muslims also count.</description>

HIGHLIGHT OF AGITATION AGAINST THE TIPU SULTAN SERIAL
B.N. JOG
Three years back, one news item which appeared on the pages of many dailies attracted my attention. The news item was about a big studio-fire in Bangalore, where shooting of Shri Sanjay Khan&amp;rsquo;s tele-serial, &amp;ldquo;The Sword of Tipu Sultan&amp;rdquo; was in progress. Scores of young artistes died and many others were injured in the studio-fire. While going through the press report, I was amazed to read that &amp;ldquo;in this TV serial Tipu Sultan is being depicted as a great warrior and secular benevolent ruler&amp;rdquo;.</description>

A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-3
An year or so before Sardar Patel&amp;rsquo;s death in December 1950, there was a serious rift between him and Prime Minister Nehru on questions concerning the foreign policy of India. The Sardar did not like the way in which our foreign affairs were being conducted. He felt that our foreign policy was too servile to the Soviet camp in spite of the violent hostility which that camp had all along shown towards the Government of independent India.</description>

 To,

Writers’ Building,
Calcutta - 1.
Dear Sir,
Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.
As you may be aware, the Islamic religious book, Koran, also spelt as ‘Qur’an’, said to be a collection of revelations made through the angel Gabriel by the almighty Allah to the Prophet Muhammad, containing numerous sayings, repeated in the book over and over again, which on grounds of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility, and though most of the events which had occasioned those sayings have now lost all historical significance, the book is still published in the unabridged form, with persistence, and clearly with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging or insulting other religions and the religious feelings of other communities in India which is apparent from the fact that all the publishers of the book know very well that the various sayings of the book are offensive in this sense.</description>

Encounter with Maharshi Dayananda
Compared to the intervals between the encounters narrated so far, the next encounter between Hinduism and Christianity took a much longer time in coming. John Muir had published the third and final edition of his MataparIkshA in 1854. Before Hindu Pandits could take notice of any new points raised in it, the Great Rebellion broke out in 1857. Christianity was no longer a subject of public debate.</description>

This was a central theme in the work of the late Ram Swarup and has remained so for those who have learned from him, including Sita Ram Goel and Arun Shourie, the authors specifically studied in the paper under consideration.</description>

      <description>12. General conclusion
12.1. A concession to convention
As part of their entrenched power position, the British colonisers and later their Nehruvian successors have always tried to control the discourse on religion. Among other concerns, they have seen to it that the term “Hindu” got divorced from its historical meaning, which quite inclusively encompassed all Indian Pagans, in order to fragment Hindu society. In parallel with their effort to pit caste against caste, they have tried to pit sect against sect, offering nurture to the egos of sect leaders by telling them that in fact they were popes in their own right of full-fledged religions, equal in status but morally superior to Hinduism.</description>

      <description>13. Hindutva and other peoples&#39; nationalism
 The BJP&#39;s subordination of any and every ideological or  religious conflict to questions of &amp;ldquo;national unity and integrity&amp;rdquo;, this most mindless form of territorial nationalism, is also a worrying retreat from the historical Hindu conception of Indian nationhood and its implications for the evaluation of foreign problems of national unity. Along with Mahatma Gandhi and other Freedom Fighters, the BJS used to be convinced that India was a self-conscious civilizational unit since several thousands of years, strengthened in its realization of unity by the Sanskrit language, the Brahmin caste, the pilgrimage cycles which brought pilgrims from every part of India all around the country (&amp;ldquo;country&amp;rdquo; rather than the &amp;ldquo;Subcontinent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;South Asia&amp;rdquo;, terms which intrinsically question this unity), and other socio-cultural factors of national integration.</description>

Jihãd in the Shariat
In Islam, the term ‘Shariat’ is often used to mean the system of ordinances as given in the Koran and the Hadis. But I shall use it in a more restrictive sense - for those ordinances which were formulated in the schools of jurisprudence (Fiqh) of the famous Imams Hanîfah, Hanbal, Mãlik and Shãfi’î. The school of Hanîfah being the most popular in the Islamic world, I shall confine my attention to that school alone and use Shykh Burhanuddin Ali’s (d.</description>

ISLAMIC MANIFESTO FOR INDIA
It is old. It is new. It is an enduring theme on which the Ulama and the Sufis of Islam thrive.
It is a rueful review of an opportunity lost in the past. It is a fond dream about a future fulfilment. It is a fanatic faith to fight for in the present.
Borrowing a metaphor from the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx, the theme can be summarised as well as sloganized as follows: “We, the Ulama and the Sufis of Islam, disdain to hide our aim.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER TWELVE
MONOTHEISM SPREADS TO ARABIA
Monotheism had infected the Jews some two millenia before the birth of Muhammad. Moses had sold them into slavery to Jehovah, a demoniacal Spirit masquerading as the one and only God.¹ Many books of the Bible tell the blood-curdling story of what the Jews did to themselves and to the others when goaded by this Gangster. The end result was their own ruination, and their dispersal as slaves and refugees in all directions.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XI
RULES REGARDING MANUMISSION AND SALE OF SLAVES
It has been seen in the preceding pages that a very prominent feature of Muslim polity, society and economy in this country was its slave system. Muslim history throughout the country and indeed in this world is incomplete without its slaves. The two main sources of obtaining slaves were by capture and purchase. The two main means of their disposal were by manumission and sale.</description>

      <description>Thus is was political and national necessity that was at once the cause and the effect of the decline of Buddhism in India. Buddhism had its geographicalcentre of gravity nowhere. So it was an imperative need to restore at least the national centre of gravity that India had lost in attempting to get identified with Buddhism. When the nation grew intensely self-conscious as an organism would do and was in direct conflict with non-self it instinctively turned to draw the line of division and mark well the position it occupied so as to make it clear to themselves where they exactly stood and to the world how they were unmistakably a people by themselves-not only a racial and national, but even a geographical and political unit.</description>

      <description>Meanwhile Raghoba was dominating and shaping great events at Delhi. He helped Gaziuddin to assume the office of the Imperial Vazir. He forced the Emperor to cede Gaya and Kurukshetra to the Marathas. He personally advanced and occupied Mathura, Brindawan, Gadmukteshwar, Pushpavati, Pushkar and several other religious places of the Hindus : the sacred city of Benares, too, was entered and occupied and held by a strong Maratha detachment. Thus one of the most cherished dreams of the Hindu people was at last realized and Raghoba could proudly report to the Peshwa of having liberated and recovered almost all the holy sites and cities of Hindudom from the Moslem hands.</description>

      <description>SIND
In Sind the Sikh population was not large, though the Hindus formed about 30% of-the population of the province. Out of the total non-Muslim population of 14 Lakhs, now^(1) only about 2 lakhs are left in Sind, the rest having come to India as refugees. The turning out of non-Muslims from Sind is very amply illustrative of the naked policy of turning out of Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan, for no other reason whatever except that they were not Muslims.</description>

In 1889, Swami Vivekananda translated into Bengali selections from Book I, chapters 1-6 of Thomas à Kempis&amp;rsquo;s The Imitation of Christ. They were published along with a preface in a now-defunct Bengali monthly magazine, Sāhitya Kalpadruma. The Swami&amp;rsquo;s preface and Bengali translation, entitled &amp;ldquo;Ishānusharana&amp;rdquo;,1 were later published in the Bengali Complete Works (first edition), VI, pp. 16-28. However, only the preface to The Imitation of Christ was published in the English edition of the Complete Works, VIII.</description>

Om Salutations to Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna
Brothers of Calcutta!
1. We feel happy when you are happy, and we suffer when you suffer. Therefore, during these days of extreme adversity, we are striving and ceaselessly praying for your welfare and an easy way to save you from disease and the fear of an epidemic.
2. If that grave disease — fearing which both the high and the low, the rich and the poor are all fleeing the city — ever really comes in our midst, then even if we perish while serving and nursing you, we will consider ourselves fortunate because you are all embodiments of God.</description>

The Swami&amp;rsquo;s translation is from Sister Nivedita&amp;rsquo;s Unpublished Notes of Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda — selected verses recorded almost verbatim, but not necessarily in Bhartrihari&amp;rsquo;s order, by Sister Nivedita as Swami Vivekananda translated them orally for some of his Western disciples during a Himalayan pilgrimage in 1898.</description>

PLACE: Different parts of India.
TIME: The year 1898.
Beautiful have been the days of this year. In them the Ideal has become the Real. First in our riverside cottage at Belur; then in the Himalayas, at Naini Tal and Almora; afterwards wandering here and there through Kashmir — everywhere have come hours never to be forgotten, words that will echo through our lives forever, and once, at least, a glimpse of the Beatific Vision.</description>

CHAPTER I THE HOUSE ON THE GANGES
PLACE: A cottage at Belur, beside the Ganges.
TIME: March to May, 1898.
Of the home by the Ganges the Master had said to one, &amp;ldquo;You will find that little house of Dhira Mata like heaven, for it is all love, from beginning to end.
It was so indeed. Within, an unbroken harmony, and without, everything alike beautiful — the green stretch of grass, the tall cocoanut palms, the little brown villages in the jungle, and the Nilkantha that built her nest in a tree — top beside us, on purpose to bring us the blessings of Shiva.</description>

The first morning the talk was that of the central ideals of civilization — in the West, truth; in the East, chastity. He justified Hindu marriage customs as springing from the pursuit of this ideal and from the woman&amp;rsquo;s need of protection, in combination.

CHAPTER IV ON THE WAY TO KATHGODAM
JUNE 11.
On Saturday morning we left Almora. It took us two days and a half to reach Kathgodam. . . .
Somewhere en route near a curious old water-mill and deserted forge, the Swami told Dhira Mata of a legend that spoke of this hill-side as haunted by a race of centaur-like phantoms, and of an experience known to him by which one had first seen forms there and only afterwards heard the folk tale.</description>

In the mornings we still had long talks as before — some-times it would be the different religious periods through which Kashmir had passed, or the morality of Buddhism, or the history of Shiva-worship, or perhaps the position of Srinagar under Kanishka.

Vivekananda attended a prayer meeting Wednesday evening and witnessed the baptism of two young women. The service impressed him very much. He said:
I see. The sentiment is ennobling and the ceremony beautiful. It is the more impressive that the minister is honest, earnest and believes what he says.</description>

Before he left the city [Des Moines, Iowa], Vive Kananda took occasion to say a warm word of praise for the Bramo-Somaj [sic], the work it is doing in India, especially for the women, and of its representative in this country. The visit of Vive Kananda, stirring as it did the intellectual centers of the city to their depths and starting a lively religious discussion, prepared the way for the present visitor [Nagarkar] from the Orient and heightened public interest in whatever he might have to say.</description>

True brotherhood is possible only when the soul draws so near to the All-Father that jealousies and petty claims of superiority must vanish because we are so much above them.

      <description>VEDANTA IN ITS APPLICATION TO INDIAN LIFE There is a word which has become very common as an appellation of our race and our religion. The word &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; requires a little explanation in connection with what I mean by Vedantism. This word &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo; was the name that the ancient Persians used to apply to the river Sindhu. Whenever in Sanskrit there is an &amp;ldquo;s&amp;rdquo;, in ancient Persian it changes into &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo;, so that &amp;ldquo;Sindhu&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;Hindu&amp;rdquo;; and you are all aware how the Greeks found it hard to pronounce &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo; and dropped it altogether, so that we became known as Indians.</description>

To find an ascetic of the Highest Eastern type clad in a red and flowing Hindoo cloak over unmistakable American trousers is necessarily a surprise. But in other things besides dress is Swami Vivekananda astonishing. In the first place he declares that your religion or any one else&amp;rsquo;s religion is just as good as his own, and if you should happen to be a Christian or Mussulman, Baptist or Brahmin, atheist, agnostic or Catholic, it will make no difference to him.</description>

I come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to bring no new religion. I desire simply to tell you a few points that bind together all religions. I shall touch upon some things in the thought of eastern civilization that will appear strange to you and on others that I hope will appeal to you. All the religions of the world have a backbone of unity.</description>

      <description>THE WORK BEFORE US (Delivered at the Triplicane Literary Society, Madras)
The problem of life is becoming deeper and broader every day as the world moves on. The watchword and the essence have been preached in the days of yore when the Vedantic truth was first discovered, the solidarity of all life. One atom in this universe cannot move without dragging the whole world along with it. There cannot be any progress without the whole world following in the wake, and it is becoming every day dearer that the solution of any problem can never be attained on racial, or national, or narrow grounds.</description>

Owing to other attractions in the town the attendance was not large. Many of the public also associated the lecturer with the Theosophical Society, with which, however, he has, we are informed, nothing whatever to do, nor with any other society, neither does he propose forming any society himself. He believes in expounding his views to whoever will listen to them and leaving those individuals to advocate them as a whole, or with whatever modifications they may deem fitting, or to reject them altogether, believing that out of the strife of all opinions truth at length prevails.</description>

[Standard, October 23, 1895]
Since the days of Ramahoun [Ram Mohan] Roy, says the Standard, with the single exception of Keshub Chunder [Keshab Chandra] Sen, there has not appeared on an English platform a more interesting Indian figure than the Brahman who lectured in Princes&#39; [Prince&amp;rsquo;s] Hall last night. . . .
The lecture1 was a most fearless and eloquent exposition of the pantheistic philosophy of the Vedanta school, and the Swami seems to have incorporated into his system a good deal also of the moral element of the Yoga school, as the closing passage of his lecture presented in a modified form not the advocacy of mortification, which is the leading feature of the latter school, but the renunciation of all so-called material comforts and blessings, as the only means of entering into perfect union with the supreme and absolute Self.</description>

discussed in a liberal spirit, and not without humour, the chances and the charms of an universal religion.1 He showed that the underlying principles of all the great religions of the world resembled one another, and amongst the great prophets he placed the Christian Redeemer very high, implying, however, that His teaching was little borne out sometimes by His professed followers.</description>

When first we heard that the Swami Vivekananda was coming to London to expound the Vedanta Philosophy, we were hopeful that his teaching would not only confirm the faith of Spiritualists, but might also add to their number. We hoped this, because the very essence of the Hindu Philosophy is that man is a spirit, and has a body, and not that man is a body, and may have a spirit also; which is as far as many a Western mind can reach.</description>

There has been some lively correspondence between Swami Vivekanand and a retired Christian Missionary on the work and prospects of Christianity in India. Among other things, the Swami is reported to have said that &amp;ldquo;the way of converting is absolutely absurd&amp;rdquo;;
Missionary doctors do no good, because they are not in touch with the people.</description>

Swami Vivekananda explained in America the central idea of the Vedas as follows:
I humbly beg to differ from those who see in monotheism, in the recognition of a personal God, apart from Nature, the acme of intellectual development. I believe, it is only a kind of anthropomorphism which the human mind stumbles upon in its first efforts to understand the unknown.</description>

[The Bengalee, May 18, 1895]
There is not a Hindoo who is not proud of Vivekananda Swami — who would not honor him and his teachings. He has done honor to himself, to his race and his religion. If we are right in this view, it follows that the opinions of Vivekananda are entitled to the highest consideration.</description>

Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s speech, delivered in Chicago at the presentation of the Buddhists on September 26, 1893, is published in MacNeely&amp;rsquo;s edition of the &amp;ldquo;History of the Parliament of Religions&amp;rdquo;. The following were his concluding words: —
We cannot live without you, nor you without us. Then believe that separation has shown to us, that you cannot stand without the brain and the philosophy of the Brahman [sic], nor we without your heart.</description>

was given by Swami Vivekananda. The Swami who wore the red robe of his sect, spoke with great fluency and in perfect English for more than an hour without the help of a single note. He said that religion was the most wonderful factor in the social organism. If knowledge was the highest gain that science could give, what could be greater than the knowledge of God, of the soul, of man&amp;rsquo;s own nature which was given by the study of religion?</description>

      <description>14. THE RENAISSANCE OF INDIA
There is no doubt that under Prime Minister Vajpayee, India had entered her Golden Period, her second Renaissance. But will the BJP remain faithful to its original aspirations, or will it become &amp;ldquo;Congressized&amp;rdquo; as Nostradamus has predicted? Do Indians even know about their own civilization and how it influenced the whole world at one time? Unfortunately schools and universities&#39; curriculums teach a very bland and westernized outlook on India and one man, Murali Manohar Joshi, is fighting a lonely battle so that Indian children can learn to be proud of their own countries.</description>

HISTORY OF LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST THE T.V. SERIAL - The Sword of Tipu Sultan
Madhavrao D. Pathak, Advocate
 The legal fight against the shameful and motivated attempt of Doordarshan and the Government of India to project the usurper king of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, as a national hero, was a long, expensive and frustrating ordeal. According to authentic and documented history of the period, Tipu Sultan had hanged to death and sold as slaves a large number of innocent men, women, and children; looted and destroyed and burnt down hundreds of Hindu temples and Christian churches; and circumcised and converted to Muhammadanism thousands of Hindus and Christians in Mangalore, Coorg, Coimbatore, Dindigal, and Kerala.</description>

A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-4
Shri D.G. Mohan Rao, a friend from Warrangal, who has been reading this series, writes: &amp;ldquo;There is confusion to know exactly what is Ekaki&amp;rsquo;s name to write about either Shri Nehru or Krishna Menon. Ekaki collected only the &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; quotations of him-Nehru. But Nehru tells sometimes &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; also about communists. The theory and the way of collecting only &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; quotations in Nehru&amp;rsquo;s praise of communism does not underline the psychology in perfect way because there are so many other &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; quotations also in Shri Nehru&amp;rsquo;s warnings against communists.</description>

Dear Sir,
Sub: Request for proscription of ‘Koran’.
Please refer to my letter dated 20th July, 1984, (delivered in your office on the same date) in which I had made a request for forfeiture of the Islamic book, Koran, for the reason that it contains numerous sayings of Prophet Muhammad which on ground of religion promote disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities; incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility and outrage or insult other religions and the religious feelings of other communities in India, which render the book liable to be forfeited to the Government in terms of Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, read with Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code.</description>

Jihãd and Religious Riot
An important question relating to the subject of jihãd is this: in mixed populations consisting of Muslims and non-Muslims alike, should this sanguinary creed not inevitably lead to religious riots? Certainly, the Koran furnishes us with verses which have the appearance of extremely provocative utterances aimed at rousing the Mussalmans to a state of murderous mob-fury. “Go forth light armed and heavy armed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah,” says the Koran (9/41).</description>

Second Encounter in Tamil Nadu
While a heated dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity was going on in the North, with Maharshi Dayananda in the forefront, another dialogue was taking shape in South India. Its centre was in the Cauvery Delta, particularly the District of Tiruchirapally, which had witnessed the first Hindu-Christian dialogue nearly 175 years earlier. This stronghold of Hindu learning had invited concentrated missionary attention since the days of the Portuguese pirates.</description>

It happened a whole decade ago, but the method could still be tried out today. In the dying days of Khalistani terrorism, secularist Prime Minister V.P. Singh visited Panjab and proposed as his solution for terror and separatism this colourful formula: “We must open the treasury of our hearts.” He was indulging in mere poetic sentimentalism to avoid facing the real problem of Khalistani terrorism.</description>

Some people in Indian politics and in the press seem to think that by repeating the mantra secularism often enough, you will get secularism. But by saying food, food, food your hunger will not be satisfied. Rather, you will starve to death, or get bored to death by this insupportable repetitiveness.</description>

 In criticizing the Sangh&#39;s simplistic anti-Americanism, I am  not holding a brief for American foreign policy. The Organiser is entirely right in arguing that American officials are being extremely silly when they base their policies on the assumption that Pakistan is a bulwark against (rather than of) Islamic fundamentalism. But this mistake is hardly typically American: in Organiser itself, columnists play the same game of labelling Muslim entities, without asking their consent, as bulwarks against Islamic fanaticism.</description>

      <description>Nor was this attempt to identify our frontier line with the river Indus an innovation. In fact it was but the natural consequence of the great war-cry of the national revivalists &amp;lsquo;Back to the Vedas.&amp;rsquo; The Vedic State based on and backed up by the Vedic Church must be designed by the Vedic name, and-so far as it was then possible-identified with the Vedic lines. And this process of events which the very general trend of history should have enabled us to anticipate seems to have actually gone through.</description>

SEX SLAVERY
In the preceding pages it has been seen how women and children were special targets for enslavement throughout the medieval period, that is, during Muslim invasions and Muslim rule. Captive children of both sexes grew up as Muslims and served the sultans, nobles and men of means in various captives. Enslavement of young women was also due to many reasons; their being sex objects was the primary consideration and hence concentration on their captivity.</description>

Hindu intellectuals should expose Quran and Hadith i.e. Islam. Islam in itself is very very weak and fragile without any reason and philosophy. It is medieval and unscientific. So it will not at all stand the test of time.</description>

      <description>Soon after penning the letter, Raghunath Rao hastend back with his forces to the Deccan as the rainy season was imminent. It was, however, unfortunate that he had to do so and leave the newly conquered but weakly garrisoned provinces. A yet more fatal factor that was not satisfactorily dealt with was that Nazib- Khan, the most intriguing leader of the Pathani plot, was yet spared even after he was captured by the Marathas and in spite of the desire of almost all the Marathas to make him pay with his life for his treacherous dealing with Ahmedsha Abdally, in instigating him against the Maratha power.</description>

Swamiji pointed out that this had its good as well as its bad side.

      <description>(New York Times September 10, 1893) The meetings of the Social Science Association have been a considerable factor in the week’s excitement, attracting a large and representative gathering of persons at every session. A most picturesque figure at these meetings has been the Hindu priest, (Swami Vive Kananda,) who has spoken at several of them upon the deplorable condition of the poor of India and some of the causes which bring it about.</description>

      <description>(Iowa State Register December 3, 1893) Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, spoke three times in Des Moines. During his stay in the city, which was happily prolonged by the cancellation of engagements farther west, Vivekananda met many of the best people in the city, who found their time well spent discussing religious and metaphysical questions with him. But it was woe to the man who undertook to combat the monk on his own ground, and that was where they all tried it who tried it at all.</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASES (Delivered in Calcutta)
Away back, where no recorded history, nay, not even the dim light of tradition, can penetrate, has been steadily shining the light, sometimes dimmed by external circumstances, at others effulgent, but undying and steady, shedding its lustre not only over India, but permeating the whole thought-world with its power, silent, unperceived, gentle, yet omnipotent, like the dew that falls in the morning, unseen and unnoticed, yet bringing into bloom the fairest of roses: this has been the thought of the Upanishads, the philosophy of the Vedanta.</description>

      <description>(Indian Nation April 9, 1894) He (the Swami) is beating his head against the rocks when he tries to prove that a religion which lays claim to organic unity and to spirituality may embrace theism and atheism, vedantism and low ideas of idolatry. ‘Religion,’ of course, may be so defined as to be applicable to atheism, agnosticism, &amp;amp;c. Carlyle gave such a definition. But no one religion can claim at once to affirm and to deny God, to ignore Him and worship Him, to believe in Him as a subtle essence inconceivably fine, and to have &amp;lsquo;low ideas of idolatry.</description>

The “V” Club is a young organization, and its membership is “shrouded in mystery,” but that it is composed of merry and hospitable men and women was fully evidenced by the very pleasant gathering last evening.</description>

      <description>(New York Times December 13, 1895) PERSONALS &amp;ndash; Swami Trigunatitananda, a brother Sanyasi of Swami Vivekananda, who is now lecturing in New-York, undertook a few months ago a perilious journey over the snowy ranges of the Himalayas, with a view of visiting the shrines of Mount Kailas and lake Manaswarabara. He has now returned to india, after an eventful journey. From what he has seen of Tibet and of Tibetan monasteries, he has reason to believe that the discovery of the Tibetan record of Christ’s life by the Russian traveler Notovitch, regarded by many critics as a fake, is not without truth.</description>

      <description>(Indian Mirror January 21, 1897) Swami Vivekananda was accorded a most enthusiastic reception at Colombo, where he landed on the 15th instant. All classes of the Colombo community, whether Hindus or Buddhists, forgot their differences, and went to work together to render fitting honour, where honour was so eminently due. The appreciation of his splendid record of work in the West is by no means confined to his brethren in the faith, for the fact of the Buddhists having co-operated with the Hindus in acknowledging the debt of gratitude, under which he has laid all followers of the several Eastern creeds, is a proof positive of his services having been estimated at their true worth, outside the ranks of Hinduism.</description>

      <description>VEDIC TEACHING IN THEORY AND PRACTICE When the Swami&amp;rsquo;s visit was drawing to a close, his friends in Almora invited him to give a lecture in Hindi. He consented to make the attempt for the first time. He began slowly, and soon warmed to his theme, and found himself building his phrases and almost his words as he went along. Those best acquainted with the difficulties and limitations of the Hindi language, still undeveloped as a medium for oratory, expressed their opinion that a personal triumph had been achieved by Swamiji and that he had proved by his masterly use of Hindi that the language had in it undreamt-of possibilities of development in the direction of oratory.</description>

      <description>BHAKTI (Delivered at Sialkote, Punjab)
In response to invitations from the Punjab and Kashmir, the Swami Vivekananda travelled through those parts. He stayed in Kashmir for over a month and his work there was very much appreciated by the Maharaja and his brothers. He then spent a few days in visiting Murree, Rawalpindi, and Jammu, and at each of these places he delivered lectures. Subsequently he visited Sialkote and lectured twice, once in English and once in Hindi.</description>

      <description>THE COMMON BASES OF HINDUISM On his arrival at Lahore the Swamiji was accorded a grand reception by the leaders, both of the Ârya Samāj and of the Sanātana Dharma Sabhā. During his brief stay in Lahore, Swamiji delivered three lectures. The first of these was on &amp;ldquo;The Common Bases of Hinduism&amp;rdquo;, the second on &amp;ldquo;Bhakti&amp;rdquo; , and the third one was the famous lecture on &amp;ldquo;The Vedanta&amp;rdquo; . On the first occasion he spoke as follows:</description>

      <description>BHAKTI (Delivered at Lahore on the 9th November, 1897)
There is a sound which comes to us like a distant echo in the midst of the roaring torrents of the Upanishads, at times rising in proportion and volume, and yet, throughout the literature of the Vedanta, its voice, though clear, is not very strong. The main duty of the Upanishads seems to be to present before us the spirit and the aspect of the sublime, and yet behind this wonderful sublimity there come to us here and there glimpses of poetry as we read; न तत्र सुर्यो भाति न चंन्द्रतारकं नेमा विद्युतो भान्ति कुतोऽयमग्निः — &amp;ldquo;There the sun shines not, nor the moon, nor the stars, what to speak of this fire?</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA (Delivered at Lahore on 12th November, 1897)
Two worlds there are in which we live, one the external, the other internal. Human progress has been made, from days of yore, almost in parallel lines along both these worlds. The search began in the external, and man at first wanted to get answers for all the deep problems from outside nature. Man wanted to satisfy his thirst for the beautiful and the sublime from all that surrounded him; he wanted to express himself and all that was within him in the language of the concrete; and grand indeed were the answers he got, most marvellous ideas of God and worship, and most rapturous expressions of the beautiful.</description>

      <description>VEDANTISM At Khetri on 20th December 1897, Swami Vivekananda delivered a lecture on Vedantism in the hall of the Maharaja&amp;rsquo;s bungalow in which he lodged with his disciples. The Swami was introduced by the Raja, who was the president of the meeting; and he spoke for more than an hour and a half. The Swami was at his best, and it was a matter of regret that no shorthand writer was present to report this interesting lecture at length.</description>

      <description>**12. Adwayanand R. Galatge **
 Dr. Shreerang Godbole, an RSS worker from Pune, has done some plain speaking to the Sangh leaders on the question of Muslims. It is tragic to find that they really deserve it. It is a measure of the level to which the RSS has been reduced by its leaders’ recent preoccupation with politics. The sordid drama recently enacted on the Gujarat stage exposes the hazards of politics to which RSS is open and can ill-afford.</description>

A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-5
Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru have always been associated in our intelligentsia&amp;rsquo;s mind as leftists and socialists who are supposed to have stood for the same sort of ideals during the days of our struggle against foreign rule or at least upto 1939 when Bose was ousted from the Indian National Congress by &amp;ldquo;Sardar Patel&amp;rsquo;s rightist clique&amp;rdquo;. The intelligentsia is also aware that at no time did Pandit Nehru have a soft corner for Bose whom he increasingly came to suspect as a sympathiser of Fascism and Nazism.</description>

Recapitulation
In summing up the contents of this book one must remember that its aim is the exposition of the theoretical aspects of jihãd, and as such its subject is Islamic tenets rather than Islamic history. This remark applies with equal force to the brief historical accounts of the Prophet’s own jihãds which this book mentions. These are intended as accounts of the Prophet’s Sunnah or practice which is part and parcel of theoretical Islam as distinct from the Islam of history.</description>

Encounter with Swami Vivekananda
The spokesman for Hinduism in the next dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity was Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902). A significant feature of this dialogue was that, for the most part, it was held in the homelands of Christianity. Vivekananda not only carried the message of Hinduism to the USA and Europe during his two trips from 1893 to 1897 and from 1899 to 1900, he also turned the tide against Christianity in India so far as educated, upper class Hindus were concerned.</description>

      <description>14. &amp;ldquo;Hindu Fascism&amp;rdquo; 14.1. Hinduism, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s mother? A Contention often heard in secularist circles, is that this Hindu revivalism is a form of Hindu fascism. Specifically, a BJP in power would soon reveal itself to be a Nazi government&amp;ndash; but then it would be too late. I will not bother about quoting all the people who have made such allegations (there are many), and just deal with the substance of this allegation.</description>

      <description>15. A party of shopkeepers
 The BJP eagerly wants to be friends with everyone who counts as  respectable. The best predictor of their positions in upcoming political issues is: what will the opinion-making establishment say? When new fads appear on the public scene, whether it is the Ambedkar cult or reservations for women in Parliament, the BJP is sure to pick them up in due course.[1] Instead of radicalism, the record of its manifestoes, resolutions, interventions in parliament, and public statements, shows a goody-goody approach to all the forces which are animated by a declared and unyielding hatred of the BJP.</description>

Ban this Book1
Koenraad Elst
In a letter dated August 20, 1993, Janata Dal MP Syed Shahabuddin has asked the Minister of State for Home, P.M. Sayeed, to ban the book Hindu View of Christianity and Islam by Ram Swarup (Voice of India, New Delhi 1992). It is not his first time: in 1988, Shahabuddin was instrumental in getting Salman Rushdie&amp;rsquo;s The Satanic Verses banned. This time he has not been equally successful in getting the book swiftly banned, but judicial proceedings are under way to get it banned after all.</description>

Hinduism Today invited some interesting letters from its readers, Hindus as well as Christians. They are reproduced as below:
HINDUISM TODAY, APRIL-MAY 1987
Catholic Ashrams
The article on the above subject in your November-December issue exposes a fraud which Catholic missionaries have been practising upon unwary Hindus for a long time. An average Hindu does not know that the missionary clad in ochre robes is no sadhu, but a scheming impostor.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER FOURTEEN
THE BIBLE APPEARS IN ARABIC
The Qur’ãn can, without an exaggeration, be called the Bible in Arabic so far as its dominant theme is concerned. That dominant theme is monotheism with all its implications, of which the most important is iconoclasm. Our judgement is confirmed by the way the pagan Arabs responded to the Qur’ãn.
The Allah of the Qur’ãn announced again and again that he was making his revelations available in the Arabic language so that the Arabs could have a scripture of their own.</description>

Pakistan propaganda has sought to make the world believe that the happenings of 1947 in the Punjab were the result of what it calls ‘Some specific Plan’ on the part of Sikhs. -What this ‘Plan’ exactly was, what were the specific objectives which it set out to achieve is not made exactly clear, but nevertheless it is asserted that a Sikh ‘Plan’ existed to destroy Muslim life.</description>

Nazibkhan and other Mnhammadan leaders pointed at those events as justifying their fears and attempts to rouse the Muhammadans to the gravity of the situation. They loudly declared that the much dreaded Hindu- Pad-Padashahi—nay, as Nazib and Muhammadan zealots would deliberately have it—the Brahman padshahi +++(5)+++ had become an accomplished fact.</description>

      <description>POSTSCRIPT
We began by quoting Thomas Patrick Hughes to say that “slavery of Islam is interwoven with the Law of marriage, the Law of sale, and the Law of inheritance… and its abolition would strike at the very foundation of the code of Muhammadanism”.^(1) The statement holds as good today as in the early years of Islam. The rules of Islam remain the same for all time, for Islam is changeless and unchangeable.</description>

I come, oh free Ocean, to measure my huge soul with thee.+++(5)+++

      <description>The most ancient of the names of our country of which we have a record is Saptasindhu or Sindhu. Even Bharatvarsha is and must necessarily be a latter designation besides being personal in its appeal. The glories of a person however magnificent, lose their glamour as time passes on. The name that recommends itself by appealing to such personal glories and achievements can never be so effective and permanent a source of everrising consciousness of gratitude and pride as a name that besides being reminiscent of such national achievements and beloved personal touches, is in addition to it associated with some great beneficent and perennial natural phenomena.</description>

Savarkar’s dramatic release was a pleasant surprise to Hindudom. Leaders like Sri Kelkar, Bhai Parmananda, Dr. Moonje and Sri Aney were happy over the exhilarating event that brought to them the release of a national force. The reaction of the Congress High Command to his release was notable. Pandit Nehru welcomed Savaikar back to freedom. Rajaji felt great joy at the release of a national hero, who was to him a symbol of courage, bravery and patriotism.</description>

Noble) delivered a lecture on &amp;ldquo;The Influence of Indian Spiritual Thought in England&amp;rdquo; on 11th March, 1898, at the Star Theatre, Calcutta. Swami Vivekananda on rising to introduce Miss Noble spoke as follows:

When I was travelling through the Eastern parts of Asia, one thing especially struck me — that is the prevalence of Indian spiritual thought in Eastern Asiatic countries.</description>

      <description>WHAT HAVE I LEARNT? (Delivered at Dacca, 30th March, 1901)
At Dacca Swamiji delivered two lectures in English. The first was on &amp;ldquo;What have I learnt?&amp;rdquo; and the second one was &amp;ldquo;The Religion we are born in &amp;ldquo;. The following is translated from a report in Bengali by a disciple, and it contains the substance of the first lecture:
First of all, I must express my pleasure at the opportunity afforded me of coming to Eastern Bengal to acquire an intimate knowledge of this part of the country, which I hitherto lacked in spite of my wanderings through many civilised countries of the West, as well as my gratification at the sight of majestic rivers, wide fertile plains, and picturesque villages in this, my own country of Bengal, which I had not the good fortune of seeing for myself before.</description>

In spite of the warm weather of yesterday afternoon, a goodly number of members of the Thought and Work club, with guests, gathered in Wesley chapel to meet Swami Vive Kanonda,1 a Hindoo monk, now travelling in this country, and to listen to an informal address from that gentleman, principally upon the religion of the Hindoos as taught by their Vedar (Vedas.</description>

Chicago, Sept. 23:
There is a room at the left of the entrance to the Art Palace marked &amp;ldquo;No. 1 — keep out.&amp;rdquo; To this the speakers at the Congress of Religions all repair sooner or later, either to talk with one another or with President Bonney, whose private office is in one corner of the apartment.

      <description>AT THE PARLIAMENT OF RELIGIONS (The Dubuque, Iowa, Times, September 29, 1893)
WORLD&amp;rsquo;S FAIR, Sept. 28. — (Special.) — The Parliament of religions reached a point where sharp acerbities develop. The thin veil of courtesy was maintained, of course, but behind it was ill feeling. Rev. Joseph Cook criticised the Hindoos sharply and was more sharply criticised in turn. He said that to speak of a universe that was not created is almost unpardonable nonsense, and the Asiatics retorted that a universe which had a beginning is a self-evident absurdity.</description>

      <description>PERSONAL TRAITS (Critic, October 7, 1893)
. . . It was an outgrowth of the Parliament of Religions, which opened our eyes to the fact that the philosophy of the ancient creeds contains much beauty for the moderns. When we had once clearly perceived this, our interest in their exponents quickened, and with characteristic eagerness we set out in pursuit of knowledge. The most available means of obtaining it, after the close of the Parliament, was through the addresses and lectures of Swami Vivekananda, who is still in this city [Chicago].</description>

At the Congregational Church, during the past week, there have been given a course of lectures which in nature much resembled the Religious Parliament which has just been completed. The lecturers were Dr. Carl van Bergen of Sweden, and Suami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk. &amp;hellip; Suami Vivekananda is a representative from India to the Parliament of Religions. He has attracted a great deal of attention on account of his unique attire in Mandarin colors, by his magnetic presence and by his brilliant oratory and wonderful exposition of Hindu philosophy.</description>

      <description>HINDU CIVILISATION [Although the lecture at Streator on October 9 was well attended, the Streator Daily Free Press of October 9 ran the following somewhat dreary review:]
The lecture of this celebrated Hindoo at the Opera House, Saturday night, was very interesting. By comparative philology, he sought to establish the long admitted relationship between the Aryan races and their descendants in the new world. He mildly defended the caste system of India which keeps three-fourths of the people in utter and humiliating subjection, and boasted that the India of today was the same India that had watched for centuries the meteoric nations of the world flash across the horizon and sink into oblivion.</description>

 I have your request for response to the circular titled ‘Time for Stock Taking’ and here is my response for the first document given item-wise in order to keep it to the minimum.
 1. It may be possible in the next 100 years or so to add Jesus Christ as one of the many Gods (33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses) as Jesus is a Godhead for Christians and Christians have no objection for portraying Jesus and his disciples in the form of idols and pictures just as Hindus have added Buddha as one of the Avataras.</description>

      <description>FOURTEEN
A FELLOW-TRAVELLER OF SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY-6
The main plank of Congress propaganda after independence has been that it drove out the British by means of non-violent non-cooperation and brought freedom to the country. The Congress refers with particular pride to the policies it pursued during the Second World War period, particularly after the Quit India Resolution was passed in Bombay in August 1942. To put it simply, we are asked to believe that British imperialism in India got frightened because some Congressmen in some parts of the country pulled down some telephone poles and broke a number of letter-boxes before they were herded into British jails.</description>

Conclusion
In concluding this small treatise on the important Islamic doctrine of jihãd, the reader must be reminded that it does not purport to be a critique of Islam as such. Even in the restricted field of its survey, its aim has been descriptive rather than critical. But before one leaves the subject it is only fair to address to the reader certain reflections which the foregoing discussion inevitably raises.</description>

Encounter with Mahatma Gandhi
The next dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity was the longest in duration and the richest in content. The spokesman for Hinduism was Mahatma Gandhi. Christianity was represented by many men and women from India and abroad. Some of them occupied high positions in the worldwide Christian mission.
The dialogue started in 1893 when Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi reached South Africa as a barrister and discovered that the Christians who befriended him were looking forward to his conversion.</description>

But for people who are part of it, symbols do matter. The Indian Constitution specifically demands respect for the flag and the anthem, even though these are only symbols. So, all due respect for symbols. Nevertheless, a symbol is only a symbol of something. It is this something that makes the symbol into something that matters.</description>

      <description>16. Things to do for the BJP
 The cleverness of the BJP is in evidence again in its choice to  put the enactment of a Common Civil Code on India&amp;rsquo;s political agenda. In India, marriage, divorce and inheritance are regulated by religion-based law codes which are different for Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis. Thus, a Hindu who wants to marry two women, knows that he will be punishable, but no longer if he converts to Islam (which is why there are actual cases of conversion for the sake of bigamy).</description>

MUHAMMAD AND THE MECCANS
The Prophet had kept his mission concealed for three years after he received the first revelations. The Muslim brotherhood had functioned as a secret society. Ibn Ishãq gives a list of persons who had joined.^(1) “The advantage of the darkness for the first few years was great. The darkness saved it from being crushed at the outset. Ridicule and contempt could be more easily endured when some hundred persons were involved, than if the Prophet had been compelled to endure them by himself.</description>

The ideal and ideology which Sav£irkar laid down and propagated is called the Hindu Sanghatan ideology or Hindu Nationalism or Savarkarism. Although a natural development, an outgrowth and a manilestation of the various views and tenets upheld by several Hindu nationalists jointly, severally or individually, the ideology is put into a form and finally formulated and codified into an integrated doctrine of social and political outlook on life by Savarkar.</description>

      <description>The loss was formidable, for, while Bhau along with the bravest that followed him was sustaining an unequal struggle round their national standard, the Marathas were getting completely routed all along the line, hotly pursued by the foes. Thousands fell dead. Thousands were made prisoners whom the next morning their furious victor made to stand in row after row and butchered in cold blood. The booty the Afghans got was also immense.</description>

      <description>But it must not be supposed that the epithet Sindhu recommended itself to our patriots only because it was geographically the best fitted; for we find it emphatically stated that the concept expressed by this word was national and not merely geographical. Sindhusthan was not merely a piece of land but it was a nation which was ideally if not always actually a state (rajnah-rashtram). It also clearly followed that the culture that flourished in Sindhusthan and the citizens thereof were Sindhus even as they had been in the Vedic days.</description>

      <description>AN INTERESTING LECTURE (Wisconsin State Journal, November 21, 1893)
The lecture at the Congregational Church [Madison] last night by the celebrated Hindoo monk, Vivekananda, was an extremely interesting one, and contained much of sound philosophy and good religion. Pagan though he be, Christianity may well follow many of his teachings. His creed is as wide as the universe, taking in all religions, and accepting truth wherever it may be found. Bigotry and superstition and idle ceremony, he declared, have no place in &amp;ldquo;the religions of India&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Swami Vive Kananda, the Hindoo monk, who is to lecture at the Auditorium [Memphis] tonight, is one of the most eloquent men who has ever appeared on the religious or lecture platform in this country. His matchless oratory, deep penetration into things occult, his cleverness in debate, and great earnestness captured the closest attention of the world&amp;rsquo;s thinking men at the World&amp;rsquo;s Fair Parliament of Religion, and the admiration of thousands of people who have since heard him during his lecture tour through many of the states of the Union.</description>

An audience of fair proportions gathered last night at the Auditorium to greet the celebrated Hindu monk. Swami Vive Kananda, in his lecture on Hinduism.
He was introduced in a brief but informing address by Judge R. J. Morgan, who gave a sketch of the development of the great Aryan race, from which development have come the Europeans and the Hindus alike, so tracing a racial kinship between the people of America and the speaker who was to address them.</description>

The subject discussed was &amp;ldquo;Manners and Customs in India.&amp;rdquo; Vive Kananda is advancing theories of religious thought which find ready lodgment in the minds of some of the most advanced thinkers of this as well as other cities of America.</description>

The second lecture of the Hindoo monk, Swami Vive Kananda, was given last evening at the Unitarian church to a large and very appreciative audience. The expectation of the audience that the speaker would enlighten them regarding &amp;ldquo;Hindoo Philosophy,&amp;rdquo; as the lecture was entitled, was gratified to only a limited extent. Allusions were made to the philosophy of Buddha, and the speaker was applauded when he said that Buddhism was the first missionary religion of the world, and that it had secured the largest number of converts without the shedding of a drop of blood; but he did not tell his audience anything about the religion or philosophy of Buddha.</description>

I cannot comply with the request of The News to work a miracle in proof of my religion,&amp;quot; said Vive Kananda to a representative of this paper, after being shown The News editorial on the subject. &amp;ldquo;In the first place, I am no miracle worker, and in the second place the pure Hindoo religion I profess is not based on miracles. We do not recognize such a thing as miracles.</description>

Kananda lectured last night at the Unitarian church on &amp;ldquo;The Women of India.&amp;rdquo; The speaker reverted to the women of ancient India, showing in what high regard they are held in the holy books, where women were prophetesses. Their spirituality then was admirable. It is unfair to judge women in the east by the western standard. In the west woman is the wife; in the east she is the mother.</description>

For, the Soviet Union won the War along with her Western allies.</description>

The Hoax of Human Rights
The next encounter between Hinduism and Christianity took place in the Constituent Assembly which started framing independent India’s Constitution in 1947 and completed the work by the end of 1949. The dialogue centred round what the Christian participants proclaimed as the their fundamental human right, namely, to propagate their religion.
The Christians were quite clear in their mind as well as pronouncements that the “right to propagate” religion entitled them to 1) receive massive financial help from foreign sources; 2) maintain and multiply churches and missions; 3) train and mobilize an ever expanding army of missionaries, native and foreign; 4) enlarge the mission infrastructure of seminaries, social service institutions and mass media; and 5) convert an increasing number of Hindus to Christianity by every means including fraud and material inducements.</description>

 The Sangh is even less combative vis-à-vis Christianity than  vis-à-vis Islam. The Christian Churches must be counted among Hindutva&amp;rsquo;s most determined enemies. Much of the negative image which the BJP has acquired internationally is due to the lasting powerful impact of the Churches on the information stream concerning the Third World. In quarrels between the Hindutva forces and the Muslims or the secularists, the Christian institutions are invariably on the anti-Hindu side.</description>

**Jihãd and Expulsion of Non-Muslims **
from Islamic Countries
Is expulsion of non-Muslims from countries conquered by Islam a tenet of jihad? The question is important, for a whole chapter of the Koran is concerned with this very topic. Sûrah 59 of the Koran is entitled Hashr which in plain English means ‘banishment’. The sûrah refers to the expulsion of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nazir from Medina in early 625 AD.</description>

      <description>Book Two, Part VIIIâ€”Conversion of the Fallen and the Criminals
1. *Conversion of a Vagabond* &amp;ndash; 2. *Conversion of Angulimala, the Robber* &amp;ndash; 3. *Conversion of Other Criminals* &amp;ndash; 4. *Risk of Conversion*
§ 1 Conversion of a Vagabond
 There was in olden times a certain disorderly person living in Rajagraha, who neither reverenced his parents nor paid respect to his superiors, but always had resort to sacrifice and worship of the sun and moon and fire when he went wrong, hoping thereby to get merit, and feel happy in himself.</description>

The Third Dialogue
This dialogue developed around a letter which K.V. Ramakrishna Rao wrote to the Indian Express in protest against Christian missionaries masquerading as Hindu sannyasins.
INDIAN EXPRESS, 13 FEBRUARY 1989
Crucifying the &amp;lsquo;Om&amp;rsquo;
Sir,-Nowadays, we find several Christian missionaries putting up ashrams at various places in India donning ochre robes, building temple-like churches, reciting Sanskrit slokas and practising other Hindu rites in the guise of &amp;lsquo;inculturation&amp;rsquo; - synthesis of Hinduism and Christianity.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER SIXTEEN
THE PROPHET DESTROYS PAGAN TEMPLES
Judaism and Christianity had equipped the Prophet of Islam with an exclusive god and a sectarian scripture which declared war on pagan Gods and their places of worship. The Jews and Christians in Arabia, descended from immigrants or native converts, also provided practical demonstration of how to proceed vis-a-vis pagan temples, whenever and wherever these two sects acquired political power, howsoever shortlived.
We do not know what the Christianized Arabs on the borders of the Byzantine Empire did to pagan places of worship; the sources are silent on the subject.</description>

      <description>I
Owing to their stupendous ignorance of and a wrong approach to the Moslem problem, the Congress leaders betrayed a woeful lack of self-confidence in the conduct of the national struggle. This ultimately discredited the prestige and patriotism of the Hindus, undermined the pov/er of the national majority, and mortgaged the destiny of the country to the anti-national forces.
Savarkar’s insight perceived this growing danger from the designs of the awakened Muslim mind.</description>

      <description>This Royal Decree was as all Royal Decrees in Sindhusthan had generally been, the mere executive outcome of a strong and popular movement. For, the custom of looking upon Attock as the veritable Indian land&amp;rsquo;s end as the very word Attock signifies could not have been originated and observed so universally and so long, had it not been inspired by and appealing to our national imagination. This custom that is so tenaciously and reverently observed by millions of people, premiers and peasants alike, is a good proof that strongly corroborates the fact that some such royal edict sanctioning the identification of our frontiers with the ancient Sindhu and associating the name of our land and nation with it as Sindhusthan had actually been issued; and that the highest religious sanctification consecrating this royal sanction and popular will must have enabled this attempt to restore the Vedic name of our country to triumph in the end.</description>

      <description>The enemies of Maharashtra, seeing it left practically leaderless by the death of Nanasaheb and expecting the Maratha Confederacy to collapse under the heavy blow it had to face at Panipat, rose and beset her on all sides. Haidar found the opportunity to usurp the Government of Mysore from the hands of his Hindu master and sovereign and to invade the Maratha territories from the south. The Nizam at Hyderabad had made feverish preparations to avenge his defeat at Udgir.</description>

Standing Up to Scrutinize Islam1
G.A. Wells
Why I Am Not a Muslim, By Ibn Warraq (Amherst, N.Y. : Prometheus Books, 1995) 402 pp., $25.95 cloth.
Why I Am Not a Muslim certainly deserves the epithet &amp;ldquo;courageous&amp;rdquo; with which R. J. Hoffmann introduces it in his Foreword, not so much because of its thesis that Islamic civilization often reached magnificent heights despite the religion of Islam, as because almost all the fundamental tenets of Islam are here scrutinized uncompromisingly.</description>

(Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, on February 2, 1900)
Buddhistic India is our subject tonight. Almost all of you, perhaps, have read Edwin Arnold&amp;rsquo;s poem on the life of Buddha, and some of you, perhaps, have gone into the subject with more scholarly interest, as in English, French and German, there is quite a lot of Buddhistic literature.</description>

      <description>THE PREPARATION The best definition given of Bhakti-Yoga is perhaps embodied in the verse: &amp;ldquo;May that love undying which the non-discriminating have for the fleeting objects of the senses never leave this heart of mine — of me who seek after Thee!&amp;rdquo; We see what a strong love men, who do not know any better, have for sense-objects, for money, dress, their wives, children, friends, and possessions. What a tremendous clinging they have to all these things!</description>

      <description>THE FIRST STEPS The philosophers who wrote on Bhakti defined it as extreme love for God. Why a man should love God is the question to be solved; and until we understand that, we shall not be able to grasp the subject at all. There are two entirely different ideals of life. A man of any country who has any religion knows that he is a body and a spirit also.</description>

      <description>THE TEACHER OF SPIRITUALITY Every soul is destined to be perfect, and every being, in the end, will attain to that state. Whatever we are now is the result of whatever we have been or thought in the past; and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we do or think now. But this does not preclude our receiving help from outside; the possibilities of the soul are always quickened by some help from outside, so much so that in the vast majority of cases in the world, help from outside is almost absolutely necessary.</description>

      <description>THE NEED OF SYMBOLS Bhakti is divided into two portions. One is called Vaidhi, formal or ceremonial; the other portion is called Mukhyā, supreme. The word Bhakti covers all the ground between the lowest form of worship and the highest form of life. All the worship that you have seen in any country in the world, or in any religion, is regulated by love. There is a good deal that is simple ceremony; there is also a good deal which, though not ceremony, is still not love, but a lower state.</description>

      <description>THE CHIEF SYMBOLS There are two Sanskrit words, Pratika and Pratimā. Pratika means coming towards, nearing. In all countries you find various grades of worship. In this country, for instance, there are people who worship images of saints, there are people who worship certain forms and symbols. Then there are people who worship different beings who are higher than men, and their number is increasing very rapidly — worshippers of departed spirits.</description>

      <description>THE ISHTA The theory of Ishta, which I briefly referred to before, is a subject requiring careful attention because with a proper understanding of this, all the various religions of the world can be understood. The word Ishta is derived from the root Ish, to desire, choose. The ideal of all religions, all sects, is the same — the attaining of liberty and cessation of misery. Wherever you find religion, you find this ideal working in one form or other.</description>

      <description>THE RAMAYANA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, January 31, 1900)
There are two great epics in the Sanskrit language, which are very ancient. Of course, there are hundreds of other epic poems. The Sanskrit language and literature have been continued down to the present day, although, for more than two thousand years, it has ceased to be a spoken language. I am now going to speak to you of the two most ancient epics, called the Rāmāyana and the Mahābhārata.</description>

The other epic about which I am going to speak to you this evening, is called the Mahābhārata. It contains the story of a race descended from King Bharata, who was the son of Dushyanta and Shakuntalā. Mahā means great, and Bhārata means the descendants of Bharata, from whom India has derived its name, Bhārata. Mahabharata means Great India, or the story of the great descendants of Bharata.</description>

      <description>THOUGHTS ON THE GITA During his sojourn in Calcutta in 1897, Swami Vivekananda used to stay for the most part at the Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrisnna Mission, located then at Alambazar. During this time several young men, who had been preparing themselves for some time previously, gathered round him and took the vows of Brahmacharya and Sannyāsa, and Swamiji began to train them for future work, by holding classes on the Gitā and Vedanta, and initiating them into the practices of meditation.</description>

 I am thankful to you for a copy of ‘Time for Stock Taking’ booklet.
Religions are made for people to shape their lives, in short, to establish a code of conduct for themselves. A religion which preaches that other religions are inferior, cannot be equated with a religion which preaches that all are equal and that all can attain salvation whatever way they adopt. For this matter the comparing of Islam or Christianity with Hinduism is not only impractical but totally naive.</description>

Bede Griffiths Drops the Mask
Hindus who are not conversant with the history and methods of the Christian mission, have been taken in by the soft language adopted by the mission strategists in recent years. Shri K. Swaminathan whose letters to the Indian Express have been reproduced in the previous chapter, is a typical example. It is, therefore, necessary to point out that soft language by itself means little if it does not spring from a sincere mind, and is not good-intentioned.</description>

Debate in the Constituent Assembly
On April 29, 1947, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel presented to the Constituent Assembly the interim report on Fundamental Rights as submitted by the Advisory Committee. Clause 13 and 17 among the ‘Rights relating to religion’ generated a debate which took place on May I. It was started by Shri K. M. Munshi who moved an amendment for rewording Clause 17 to read as follows: “Any conversion from one religion to another of any person brought about by fraud, coercion or undue influence or of a minor under the age of 18 shall not be recognised by law.</description>

 When Akbar had Rajput armies fight his Rajput enemies, he  rejoiced at the sight of &amp;ldquo;Hindus wielding the sword of Islam&amp;rdquo;. When his archers could not distinguish between the Rajput mercenaries and the Rajput freedom-fighters, he told them that it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter, since anyone killed would be a Kafir anyway. India&amp;rsquo;s greatest Moghul is often mindlessly lauded by Hindus as a &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; ruler, but while he should be credited with a certain wisdom, he was and remained an enemy of the Infidels.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 1
MUSLIM DYNASTIES IN INDIA’S HISTORY
Muslim dynasties which figure in the history of India are divided, by modern historians of medieval India into two categories - Imperial and Provincial. Dynasties which ruled from Delhi/Agra are called Imperial Dynasties, whatever might have been the extent of their domain or power. On the other hand, dynasties which ruled independently of Delhi/Agra are labelled as Provincial Dynasties, even though some of them overshadowed the contemporary Imperial Dynasties in terms of territory controlled, or power wielded, or both.</description>

      <description>Appendix II
Jizyah and the Zimmî
The imposition of jizyah on a vanquished infidel population being one of the five fundamentals of jihãd, besides forcible conversions, mass slaughter and the two kinds of ghanîmah (=plunder), a short discussion of this tax on religion is essential for a full understanding of the doctrine of jihãd. Needless to say, every single aspect of jihãd is aimed at the ultimate Islamic objective of conquering the whole world for Islam, but jizyah has a very special role to play in attaining that objective.</description>

We have while writing this section wounded our own feelings. So we hasten to add that the few harsh words we had to say in explaining the political necessity that led to the rejection of Buddhism in India should not be understood to mean that we have not a very high opinion of that Church as a whole !</description>

Roll Over, Rushdie1
Daniel Pipes
In March 1989, shortly after Ayatollah Khomeini issued his decree sentencing Salman Rushdie to death for his novel The Satanic Verses, London&amp;rsquo;s Observer newspaper published an anonymous letter from Pakistan. &amp;ldquo;Salman Rushdie speaks for me,&amp;rdquo; wrote its author, who explained: &amp;ldquo;Mine is a voice that has not yet found expression in newspaper columns. It is the voice of those who are born Muslims but wish to recant in adulthood, yet are not permitted to on pain of death.</description>

Actually they had been taken away from the Lalian Camp by the police guard of the camp at 2 p.m. on the 31st October, 1947. On my arrival, I received reports about this abduction from their husbands and went in search of them. I searched the above chak and recovered them at about 10-30 a.</description>

There was a great monarch named Bharata. The land which is called India by foreigners is known to her children as Bhārata Varsha. Now, it is enjoined on every Hindu when he becomes old, to give up all worldly pursuits — to leave the cares of the world, its wealth, happiness, and enjoyments to his son — and retire into the forest, there to meditate upon the Self which is the only reality in him, and thus break the bonds which bind him to life.</description>

Hiranyakashipu was the king of the Daityas. The Daityas, though born of the same parentage as the Devas or gods, were always, at war with the latter. The Daityas had no part in the oblations and offerings of mankind, or in the government of the world and its guidance. But sometimes they waxed strong and drove all the Devas from the heaven, and seized the throne of the gods and ruled for a time.</description>

      <description>THE GREAT TEACHERS OF THE WORLD (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club, Pasadena, California, February 3, 1900)
The universe, according to the theory of the Hindus, is moving in cycles of wave forms. It rises, reaches its zenith, then falls and remains in the hollow, as it were, for some time, once more to rise, and so on, in wave after wave and fall after fall. What is true of the universe is true of every part of it.</description>

      <description>ON LORD BUDDHA (Delivered in Detroit)
In every religion we find one type of self-devotion particularly developed. The type of working without a motive is most highly developed in Buddhism. Do not mistake Buddhism and Brāhminism. In this country you are very apt to do so. Buddhism is one of our sects. It was founded by a great man called Gautama, who became disgusted at the eternal metaphysical discussions of his day, and the cumbrous rituals, and more especially with the caste system.</description>

      <description>CHRIST, THE MESSENGER (Delivered at Los Angeles, California, 1900)
The wave rises on the ocean, and there is a hollow. Again another wave rises, perhaps bigger than the former, to fall down again, similarly, again to rise — driving onward. In the march of events, we notice the rise and fall, and we generally look towards the rise, forgetting the fall. But both are necessary, and both are great. This is the nature of the universe.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails, I come down to help mankind,&amp;rdquo; declares Krishna, in the Bhagavad-Gitā. Whenever this world of ours, on account of growth, on account of added circumstances, requires a new adjustment, a wave of power comes; and as a man is acting on two planes, the spiritual and the material, waves of adjustment come on both planes.</description>

 I have received your pamphlet “Time for Stock Taking”, and gone through it in detail.
Your first document mentions the attitude of Hindu organizations towards the Muslims problem.
Only Hindus who are unware of the Vedas, say that there is no harm in adding Jesus and Mohammed to the 33 crore Hindu gods and goddesses. It is an indication of the slave mentality of Hindus. Christianity and Islam are Semitic religions.</description>

When the Soviet Union denounced Pandit Nehru in 1948 as a puppet whom &amp;ldquo;American imperialism&amp;rdquo; was trying to prop up in place of the old &amp;ldquo;paper tiger&amp;rdquo;, President Chiang Kai-shek of China, the Western nations, particularly the United States of America, had proclaimed immediately that Pandit Nehru was the &amp;ldquo;bulwark of democracy in Asia&amp;rdquo;. But the Korean War was hardly half through when it was widely realised in the West that at least in the field of international politics Pandit Nehru was no friend of the West, and that his sympathies, whenever and wherever they became manifest, were always and all along with the communist camp.</description>

Missions Since Independence
The Constitution of independent India adopted in January 1950 made things quite smooth for the Christian missions. They surged forward with renewed vigour. Nationalist resistance to what had been viewed as an imperialist incubus during the Struggle for Freedom, broke down when the very leaders who had frowned upon it started speaking in its favour. Voices which still remained ‘recalcitrant’ were sought to be silenced by being branded as those of ‘Hindu communalism’.</description>

      <description>19. How not to deal with Islam
 When dealing with Islam, it is crucially important to keep in  mind the distinction between Islam as a doctrine and the Muslims, a group of people who were born or tricked into an Islamic environment. There is nothing intrinsically Islamic about human beings, not even when they are named Mohammed or Aisha.
 In Europe, the secularist Left accuses the mushrooming  national‑populist and xenophobic parties of a &amp;ldquo;biologization of cultural differences&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 2
WAS THE KA‘BA A ŠIVA TEMPLE?
Some years ago I read an article proposing that the Ka‘ba was a Šiva temple before it was converted into a mosque by Prophet Muhammad. The article cited a long hymn in Arabic addressed to Mahãdeva who, according to the article, was the presiding deity of the Ka‘ba. The hymn, it was stated, had been composed in the reign of Vikramãditya of Ujjain in the first century BC.</description>

      <description>Appendix III
Development of the Doctrine of Jihãd in the Koran
The study of any Islamic doctrine as it developed step by step in the Koran is important on many counts. Not least among these is the consideration as to how far the doctrine was moulded by pressure of immediate circumstance, and how far it stood for any perennial religious concern. As regards jihãd this question can be answered with some assurance.</description>

      <description>That a Madhao Rao, the hope of a whole people, should die young, while Raghoba, the curse of whole people, should survive a generation after him, is one of those events that make men doubt at times if God be really omnipotent as it is said to be.
The death of Madhao Rao was a great national calamity, but the survival of Raghoba was calamity even greater than that. No sooner was the childless Madho Rao succeeded in accordance with his wish and the nation’s will, by his younger brother Narayan Rao, than did Raghoba begin anew to hatch up bloody conspiracies against the young boy and those who supported him.</description>

Different Paths Meeting in God
This is an anthology1 of 12 articles contributed by distinguished theologians Catholic and Protestant, all belonging to prestigious divinity schools and universities. Some authors speak more philosophically, others more sociologically, but the book has a kind of unity which comes from a shared outlook. The authors also met at the Claremont Graduate school, California, where their first drafts were subjected to mutual criticism, thus ensuring further unity in the final product.</description>

Goes for the Jugular1
Barnard Katz
Buckle up your seat belts as Warraq takes us for a nerve-wracking ride through the seamy and sordid parts of Islam. With his book as travel guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the dark and treacherous sides of Islam.
Warraq has the credentials because he&amp;rsquo;s taken the journey himself - one that started with the certainties of growing up in a Muslim family, then through the dark night of doubt and, finally, to rejecting completely all revealed religion.</description>

      <description>So far we have depended upon Sanskrit records in tracing the growth of the word Sindhu and we have left the thread of our inquiry at the point where the growing concept of an Indian nation was found to be better expressed by the word Sindhusthan than by any other existing words. It was precisely to refute any parochial and narrow-minded significance which might, as in the case of Aryawarta be attached to this word that the definition of the word Sindhusthan was rid of any association with a particular institution or party-coloured suggestion.</description>

The Akhand Hindusllian movement was gradually gaining ground. Savarkar’s voi. was capturing the imagination of the people. Congress iri&amp;rsquo;u- nce with the ma.sses was at a low ebb. Even in Englan-i and in America the people and the Press evinced interest and eagerness to learn more about the Hindu Mahasabha and its movement, its organiza- tion and its leaders. The Hindu Mahasabha was defeating Congress candidates in Municipal, Local and District Local Board elections and bye-elections to the Legislatures.</description>

      <description>Appendix 2. Ram Swarup on Indian secularism I gladly leave the last world to Ram Swarup. By way of introduction, let me quote the first part of Arun Shourie&amp;rsquo;s article Fomenting reaction, concerning the ban on the Hindi translation of Ram Swarup&amp;rsquo;s book understanding Islam through Hadis:
Ram Swarup, now in his seventies, is a scholar of the first rank. In the 1950&amp;rsquo;s when our intellectuals were singing paeans to Marxism and to Mao in particular, he wrote critiques of communism and of the actual-that is, dismal - performance of communist governments.</description>

      <description>MEDITATION (Delivered at the Washington Hall, San Francisco, April 3, 1900*)
Meditation has been laid stress upon by all religions. The meditative state of mind is declared by the Yogis to be the highest state in which the mind exists. When the mind is studying the external object, it gets identified with it, loses itself. To use the simile of the old Indian philosopher: the soul of man is like a piece of crystal, but it takes the colour of whatever is near it.</description>

      <description>THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION (Delivered at Alameda, California, on April 18, 1900*)
We read many books, many scriptures. We get various ideas from our childhood, and change them every now and then. We understand what is meant by theoretical religion. We think we understand what is meant by practical religion. Now I am going to present to you my idea of practical religion.
We hear all around us about practical religion, and analysing all that, we find that it can be brought down to one conception — charity to our fellow beings.</description>

&amp;ldquo;None has power to destroy the unchangeable.&amp;quot; — Bhagavad-Gitā.
In the great Sanskrit epic, the Mahābhārata, the story is told how the hero, Yudhishthira, when asked by Dharma to tell what was the most wonderful thing in the world, replied, that it was the persistent belief of man kind in their own deathlessness in spite of their witnessing death everywhere around them almost every moment of their lives.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Both you and I have passed through many births; you know them not, I know them all.&amp;quot; — Bhagavad-Gitā
Of the many riddles that have perplexed the intellect of man in all climes and times, the most intricate is himself. Of the myriad mysteries that have called forth his energies to struggle for solution from the very dawn of history, the most mysterious is his own nature.</description>

      <description>ON DR. PAUL DEUSSEN (Written for the Brahmavādin, 1896.)
More than a decade has passed since a young German student, one of eight children of a not very well-to-do clergyman, heard on a certain day Professor Lassen lecturing on a language and literature new — very new even at that time — to European scholars, namely, Sanskrit. The lectures were of course free; for even now it is impossible for any one in any European University to make a living by teaching Sanskrit, unless indeed the University backs him.</description>

Though the ideal of work of our Brahmavādin should always be &amp;ldquo;कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन — To work thou hast the right, but never to the fruits thereof&amp;rdquo;, yet no sincere worker passes out of the field of activity without making himself known and catching at least a few rays of light.

      <description>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF PAVHARI BABA To help the suffering world was the gigantic task to which the Buddha gave prominence, brushing aside for the time being almost all other phases of religion; yet he had to spend years in self-searching to realise the great truth of the utter hollowness of clinging to a selfish individuality. A more unselfish and untiring worker is beyond our most sanguine imagination: yet who had harder struggles to realise the meaning of things than he?</description>

The Dolmens are not wanting. Flint implements can be dug out almost anywhere. The lake-dwellers — at least the river-dwellers — must have been abundant at one time. The cave-men and leaf-wearers still persist. The primitive hunters living in forests are in evidence in various parts of the country.</description>

      <description>(1) Rajasthan - Physiography (1) :
Rajasthan comprises the area between 23rd degree to 30th degree North latitude and 68th degree to 78th East longitude. The earliest reference to Rajasthan is in connection with its agidity. The word Maru is found in Rugwed the Mahabharat (Vanaparva, 201.41) and Brahatsamhita.
Aravalli range runs through Rajasthan, northeast to southwest, for about 430 miles, starting from Delhi (known as Delhi ridge) and extending to Ahmadabad.</description>

There is a Hindu resurgence but not to the extent it should be.
It is also true that in spite of Hindu resurgence, the Hindu organisations are becoming softer towards Islam and Muslims.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Liberal&amp;rdquo; Christianity1
Whether Christianity improves the general morals of its followers is doubtful, but it is certain that it does not widen their intellectual sympathies and does not open their hearts to the larger spiritual wealth of different peoples and cultures. This is also true of Islam, another revealed religion, but in the present discussion we shall restrict ourselves to Christianity alone.
From its early days, Christianity has claimed a monopoly of things divine.</description>

SAPPERS AND MINERS OF COMMUNISM
An ideology can be taken to have triumphed when those whom it declares to be its enemies start speaking its language. Communism has already passed that test and arrived at a stage when its thought-categories have acquired an almost universal adherence. Let us sample some of the more basic communist slogans and see how strongly and systematically they have seeped into the thought and language of the present-day intelligentsia in every corner of the world.</description>

Dethroning Monotheism
Another dialogue between Hinduism and Christianity commenced with the publication of Shri Ram Swarup’s magnum opus, The Word As Revelation: Names of Gods, in September 1980. It is still continuing.
The dialogue which Raja Ram Mohun Roy had started in the third decade of the nineteenth century stopped abruptly with the passing away of Mahatma Gandhi in January 1948. The Hindu leadership or what passed for it in post-independence India was neither equipped for nor interested in the battle for men’s minds.</description>

      <description>20. How to deal with Islam
 The &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; problem is simple, and so is its solution. The  root cause of communal riots, of the Partition with its nearly a million victims, and of the East Bengal genocide with its three million victims, is the Islamic doctrine of permanent hostility against the unbelievers.[1] As the Quran says: &amp;ldquo;Fight them until idolatry is no more and religion belongs to Allah alone&amp;rdquo; (2:193 and 8:39), and: &amp;ldquo;Enmity and hate shall reign between us until ye believe in Allah alone&amp;rdquo; (60:4).</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 3
MEANING OF THE WORD “HINDU”
In the present study we have used the expression “Hindu temples” to cover Brahmanical as well as Buddhist Jain, and Sikh temples. This sounds contrary to current usage in the world of scholarship as well as politics. But the history of the word “Hindu” supports our case. It was only in the nineteenth century that Western Indologists and Christian missionaries separated the Buddhists, the Jains, and the Sikhs from the Hindus who, in their turn, were defined as only those subscribing to Brahmanical sects.</description>

Akbar’s Attitude to Jihãd
The story of how Akbar, the Mughal emperor, earned the title of ghãzî by beheading the defenceless Himu on November 5, 1556, and its repudiation by his court historians (Abul Fazl etc.) is a silent commentary on the doctrine of jihãd by the one and the only Muslim potentate of medieval times who had a wiser head on his shoulders. I give below the two versions of the story - one from the pen of the Afghan historian Ahmad Yadgar and the other from that of Badauni (who drew his material from Nizamuddin’s Tabaqãt-i-Akbarî).</description>

      <description>At this period of our history-the rise as well as the fall of Buddhism were accompanied by a remarkable spread and growth of the vernaculars of India and Sanskrit was fast being shut up in the impenetrable fortresses of classical conventionality to such an extent that new ideas and new names had to be sanskritized before they could be incorporated in any acceptable work. Naturally the every day life and the ever changing phases of national and social activities gradually sought expession through the spoken Prakrit which thus grew better fitted to convey the living and throbbing thoughts of the people in all their freshness and vigour and precision.</description>

      <description>As soon as the news of the capitulation of a great English army reached Calcutta, the English were so wild with rage as to make them utterly unscrupulous and refusing to sanction the treaty their Commander had at Vadgaon, signed, after the captured army had been allowed to pass back to Bombay by the Marathas, according to the treaty, they renewed hostilities with added zeal. In the meanwhile Raghoba, too, who would have in other states, been shot for high treason or betrayal, was so leniently treated as a prince would have been, abused that liberty and once more effected his escape and went over to the English camp.</description>

      <description>THE SOCIAL CONFERENCE ADDRESS &amp;ldquo;God created the native, God created the European, but somebody else created the mixed breed&amp;rdquo; — we heard a horribly blasphemous Englishman say.
Before us lies the inaugural address of Mr. Justice Ranade, voicing the reformatory zeal of the Indian Social Conference. In it there is a huge array of instances of inter-caste marriages of yore, a good leaf about the liberal spirit of the ancient Kshatriyas, good sober advice to students, all expressed with an earnestness of goodwill and gentleness of language that is truly admirable.</description>

The Theosophists are having a jubilee time of it this year, and several press-notices are before us of their goings and doings for the last twenty-five years.
Nobody has a right now to say that the Hindus are not liberal to a fault. A coterie of young Hindus has been found to welcome even this graft of American Spiritualism, with its panoply of taps and raps and hitting back and forth with Mahātmic pellets.</description>

REPLY TO THE ADDRESS OF THE MAHARAJA OF KHETRI INDIA — THE LAND OF RELIGION
During the residence of the Swamiji in America, the following Address from the Maharaja of Khetri (Rajputana), dated March 4th, 1895, was received by him:
My dear Swamiji,
As the head of this Durbar (a formal stately assemblage) held today for this special purpose, I have much pleasure in conveying to you, in my own name and that of my subjects, the heartfelt thanks of this State for your worthy representation of Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions, held at Chicago, in America.</description>

FRIENDS, FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN AND CO-RELIGIONISTS OF MADRAS,
It is most gratifying to me to find that my insignificant service to the cause of our religion has been acceptable to you, not because it is as a personal appreciation of me and my work in a foreign and distant land, but as a sure sign that, though whirlwind after whirlwind of foreign invasion has passed over the devoted head of India, though centuries of neglect on our part and contempt on the part of our conquerors have visibly dimmed the glories of ancient Âryāvarta, though many a stately column on which it rested, many a beautiful arch, and many a marvellous corner have been washed away by the inundations that deluged the land for centuries — the centre is all sound, the keystone is unimpaired.</description>

WHAT WE BELIEVE IN (Written to &amp;ldquo;Kidi&amp;rdquo; on March 3, 1894, from Chicago.)
I agree with you so far that faith is a wonderful insight and that it alone can save; but there is the danger in it of breeding fanaticism and barring further progress.
Jnāna is all right; but there is the danger of its becoming dry intellectualism. Love is great and noble; but it may die away in meaningless sentimentalism.</description>

Push on with the organization. Nothing else is necessary but these — love, sincerity, and patience. What is life but growth, i.e. expansion, i.e. love? Therefore all love is life, it is the only law of life; all selfishness is death, and this is true here or hereafter. It is life to do good, it is death not to do good to others.</description>

      <description>**18. B.L. Jaju **
 I have received the circular ‘Time For Stock Taking’. You have desired that the intelligentsia, particularly the Hindu intelligentsia, should offer their opinion about the ideology of Islam and how do they react to the same.
I am liberally educated, having an open mind, and have no prejudices or preconceived thoughts about any religion, much less against Christianity or Islam.
In my opinion Hinduism or Sanatan Dharma has a long history of toleration.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX 3
The Great Command and a Cosmic Auditing1
The volume surveys 788 most important evangelizing Plans produced by Christianity during its career of over 19 hundred years. All these Plans relate to the Great Commission - the command that Jehovah gave through the mouth of His only Begotten Son, Jesus, to the believers to &amp;ldquo;go and make disciples of all nations&amp;rdquo; (Mt. 28.19, 20). If there was also a command to improve their morals, it was neglected, but the one to preach and recruit more followers for their God was rather taken in earnest.</description>

      <description>NINETEEN
CHOOSING BETWEEN USA AND USSR1
Communist China&amp;rsquo;s aggression along our Himalayan frontier has once again posed before the nation the problem of finding friends against foes in a dangerous and divided world. The nation had faced this problem at first when Pakistan signed a military pact with the United States of America, and started talking tough in the context of her self-chosen controversy over Kashmir. During those days, at least, it was seriously apprehended by the Indian people at large that Pakistan might mount an aggression against India from a position of superior military strength.</description>

Sannyasins or Swindlers?
Hinduism Today, a bimonthly^(1) published by the Saiva Siddhanta Church with headquarters in Hawaii, U.S.A., carried an article, ‘Catholic Ashrams: Adopting and Adapting Hindu Dharma’, in its issue of November-December, 1986. It noticed particularly the Saccidananda Ashram at Shantivanam in the Tiruchirapally District of Tamil Nadu. “The Shantivanam Ashram,” it said, “looks like a rishi’s home transported from Vedic times to the bank of sacred Cauvery River… A pilgrim’s first impressions are strong, and very Hindu; the elaborately colorful Hindu shrine; the bearded, saffron-robed ‘swami’ seated cross-legged on a straw mat; devotees practising yogic meditation, even chanting Hindu scriptures.</description>

      <description>21. Know the truth, and the truth shall make you free
 The struggle against Islamic aggression cannot be won without  taking issue with the basic doctrines of Islam, i.e. explaining to the Muslims that they have no reason to stay with the refuted dogmas of Islam. The same is true for Christianity. The Sangh Parivar has made much ado about the Christian demand for reservations for &amp;ldquo;Christian Dalits&amp;rdquo;, and about continuing Christian proselytization in tribal areas.</description>

QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE MARXIST PROFESSORS
We return to the Marxist professors with whom we started.
We have cited from eighty histories written by Muslims over a period of more than one thousand years. We have also cited several Islamic inscriptions which confirm what the historians say. The citations show how Hindu temples continued to be destroyed over a vast area and for a long time. We have added no “editorial comments” and given no “communal twist” to the events that took place.</description>

      <description>Appendix V
Doctrine of Jihãd as Defensive War
This book has attempted to show by means of adequate citations from the Koran that jihãd is aggressive war par excellence, with one or two verses thrown in, in between, to indicate that counsels of moderation and non-aggression are not wholly absent from the Islamic scheme of things. But as Islamic apologists the world over have of late started protesting rather loudly that Koranic^(1) jihãd is war in self-defence and nothing else, it is important that we discuss threadbare the worth of the Koranic verse which is most often referred to in this connection.</description>

Now we come to a very important chapter in the life of Savarkar. By now Rajaji, the whilom member of the All- India Congress Committee, released to the press his corres- pondence with Mr. Jinnah concerning his offer to the League leader which was fathered by Gandhiji during his fast at the Aga Kh^n Palace. Rajaji had now advanced to the far end of the proposed Pakistan scheme. Speaking on the birthday anniversary of the Prophet at Bangalore on April 12, 1943, Rajaji had said : “ I stand for Pakistan because I do not want that State where we Hindus and Muslims are both not honoured.</description>

      <description>But as it often happens in history this very undisturbed enjoyment of peace and plenty lulled our Sindhusthan, in a sense of false security and bred a habit of living in the land of dreams. At last she was rudely awakened on the day when Mohammad of Gazni crossed the Indus, the frontier line of Sindhusthan and invaded her. That day the conflict of life and death began. Nothing makes Self conscious of itself so much as a conflict with non- self.</description>

A non-Christian: Change of religion is objectionable, but it is only sentimental. Allurement of money to innocent people, which may be in the form of help to needy persons, is practised in this area. Similarly free education of children. People who were formerly Gond, Baigas and Pardhans are now calling themselves Christians.</description>

 The situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public man has occupied in India. He was the most success- ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing workers who started the New English School (1880), the Kesari and the Mahratta (1881). His opponents — Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered to their fathers before the substantial achievement of their labours.</description>

The tradition teaches that Jesus and his family were from Nazareth but that he was born in Bethlehem. Why again was it that he was born in Bethlehem? Because of Roman Emperor Augustus&#39; order to organize a census. The Bible narrates how this census took place when one Quirinius was Roman Governor of Greater Syria. For this census, we are told, Jesus&#39; parents had to go to Bethlehem, and there his birth took place.</description>

      <description>FUNDAMENTALS OF RELIGION (This incomplete article was found in the papers of Miss S. E. Waldo. The heading is inserted by us — Publisher.)
My mind can best grasp the religions of the world, ancient or modern, dead or living, through this fourfold division:
1. Symbology — The employment of various external aids to preserve and develop the religious faculty of man.
2. History — The philosophy of each religion as illustrated in the lives of divine or human teachers acknowledged by each religion.</description>

Wrenching trees by the roots,
Sweeping all from the path.

No winter was but summer came behind,
Each hollow crests the wave,

Wake up the note! the song that had its birth
Far off, where worldly taint could never reach,
In mountain caves and glades of forest deep,
Whose calm no sigh for lust or wealth or fame
Could ever dare to break; where rolled the stream
Of knowledge, truth, and bliss that follows both.
Sing high that note, Sannyāsin bold!</description>

Behold, it comes in might,
The power that is not power,

The shade in dazzling light.
It is joy that never spoke,
And grief unfelt, profound,
Immortal life unlived,
Eternal death unmourned.
It is not joy nor sorrow,
But that which is between,
It is not night nor morrow,
But that which joins them in.
It is sweet rest in music;</description>

 General
It is a tragedy that the 3 different wings, namely, the BJP which is a political institution for establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra, the RSS which is an organisational wing of BJP, and the VHP which is a religious platform for Hindus, are not able to work in unison for a common cause - establishment of Bharatiya (Hindu) Rashtra, which is the need of the hour to prevent threats of Muslim rule, either direct on by proxy in the name of secular, democratic Bharat.</description>

A Hornet’s Nest
One wonders whether it is a virtue or vice, but the Christian missionaries have been and remain compulsive record-keepers and plan-publishers. By now there are literally hundreds of thousands of publications providing details of what the Christian missions did or plan to do, where, to whom, in which manner and with what resources in money and manpower. “Each year,” says a recent publication on the subject, “some 10,000 new books and articles on mission and evangelization are published, involving seventy or so major languages.</description>

      <description>22. Hindu objections
 A Hindu policy of ideological confrontation with hostile  religions is necessary for the survival of India as an essentially Hindu country. After having flattered Christianity and Islam for several centuries, Hindus inside and outside the Sangh may come up with many objections against such a policy. As a BJP man once told me: &amp;ldquo;When we attack Christianity, it is not the Christians who leave us &amp;ndash; they are not with us anyway &amp;ndash;, it is the Hindus who won&amp;rsquo;t vote for us.</description>

A Religion Incompatible with Human Rights1
N. Innaiah
Overview
&amp;ldquo;The ability to listen to a story,&amp;rdquo; said the renowned Telugu litterateure Rachakonda Vishwanatha Shastri, &amp;ldquo;is as important as the genius for writing one.&amp;rdquo; Similarly, if writing a book is one dimension of the effort, publishing is another. These days, it often takes courage to publish a controversial book. In the wake of the persecution of Salman Rushdie and the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, many publishers have become reluctant to bring out controversial books.</description>

The Ideal An all-India Hindu Empire under the hegemony of Maharashtra Our motive in undertaking the review of Maratha history was to bring out prominently, from a general confusion of details those events which, when cogently arranged, were most likely to enable us better to appraise and appreciate the value of the modern history of Maharashtra from a Pan-Hindu point of view and to correlate and fit it in comprehensive whole—the History of the Hindu nation itself—of which the first forms but a chapter, however glorious and momentous in itself it be.</description>

The year 1946 opened with general elections to the Provincial Legislatures all over India. Congressmen used the same old tactics and reiterated the pledge of a United India. On January 14, 1946, Sardar Patel thundered at Ahmedabad : ‘‘ Granting of Pakistan is not in the hands of the British Gov- ernment. If Pakistan is to be achieved, Hindus and Muslims will have to fight. There will be a civil war.</description>

      <description>In this prolonged furious conflict our people became intensely conscious of ourselves as Hindus and were welded into a nation to an extent unknown in our history. It must not be forgotten that we have all along referred to the progress of the Hindu movement as a whole and not to that of any particular creed or religious section thereof—of Hindutva and not Hinduism only. Sanatanists, Satnamis, Sikhs, Aryas, Anaryas, Marathas and Madrasis, Brahmins and Panchamas—all suffered as Hindus and triumphed as Hindus.</description>

Government do not make any provision for schools and, therefore, missionaries have got an opportunity of working in Jabalpur. Christian mothers are put in charge of children.</description>

 T IKE his literary career, Mr. Tilak&amp;rsquo;s private life was almost absorbed into his political existence and it serves but to enhance the charm of his magnetic per- sonality and romantic career ; and yet, considered even separately, that private life, lived in the full blaze of publicity, will serve as a model for all those who consider self-introspection and self-elevation as the principle duty of life.</description>

On the 28th January, 1948, four trucks were sent from Gujranwala to Nowshera Vikram police station for local (Pocket) evacuation. When one truck had been loaded with the luggage of the evacuees, a mob of one thousand local Muslims collected with axes, etc. and attacked the party and looted the property.

The ancient history of India is full of descriptions of the gigantic energies and their multifarious workings, the boundless spirit, the combination of indomitable action and reaction of the various forces, and, above all, the profound thoughtfulness of a godly race.</description>

The Rig-Veda Samhitā, the whole of which no one could even get at before, is now very neatly printed and made accessible to the public, thanks to the munificent generosity of the East India Company and to the Professor&amp;rsquo;s prodigious labours extending over years.</description>

In the Paris Exhibition, the Congress of the History of Religions recently sat for several days together. At the Congress, there was no room allowed for the discussions on the doctrines and spiritual views of any religion; its purpose was only to inquire into the historic evolution of the different forms of established faiths, and along with it other accompanying facts that are incidental to it.</description>

      <description>KNOWLEDGE: ITS SOURCE AND ACQUIREMENT (Translated from a Bengali contribution by Swami Vivekananda to the Udbodhana, 12th February, 1899.)
Various have been the theories propounded as regards the primitive source of knowledge. We read in the Upanishads that Brahmā, who was the first and the foremost among the Devas, held the key to all knowledge, which he revealed to his disciples and which, being handed down in succession, has been bequeathed as a legacy to the subsequent age.</description>

      <description>MODERN INDIA (Translated from a Bengali contribution to the Udbodhana, March 1899)
The Vedic priests base their superior strength on the knowledge of the sacrificial Mantras. (Vedic hymns uttered by the priests to invoke the Devas at the time of sacrifice.) By the power of these Mantras, the Devas are made to come down from their heavenly abodes, accept the drink and food offerings, and grant the prayers of the Yajamānas.</description>

Where darkness is interpreted as light,
Where misery passes for happiness,
Where disease is pretended to be health,
Where the new-born&amp;rsquo;s cry but shows &amp;lsquo;tis alive;
Dost thou, O wise, expect happiness here?
Where war and competition ceaseless run,
Even the father turns against the son,
Where &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; — this always the only note,
Dost thou, O wise, seek for peace supreme here?</description>

One Mass, devoid of form, name, and colour,
Timeless, devoid of time past and future,
Spaceless, voiceless, boundless, devoid of all —
Where rests hushed even speech of negation.1
From thence, down floweth the river causal,
Wearing the form of desire radiant,
Its heaving waters angrily roaring
The constant roar, &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;.
In that ocean of desire limitless,
Appear shining waves, countless, infinite,</description>

Lo! The sun is not, nor the comely moon,
All light extinct; in the great void of space
Floats shadow-like the image-universe.
In the void of mind involute, there floats
The fleeting universe, rises and floats,
Sinks again, ceaseless, in the current &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;.
Slowly, slowly, the shadow-multitude
Entered the primal womb, and flowed ceaseless,
The only current, the &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>20. Dr. S.D. Kulkarni
 Semitic Faiths are Political Creeds, not Religions
Since its inception, Islam is being practised as a political creed. It is not a religion. These two terms creed and religion are poles apart. Creed is a dogmatic belief system as propounded by a person who claims himself to be a prophet like the Jewish prophet Moses or the Islamic prophet Muhammad, or a super-intelligent person, or a thinker like Marx, next only to God.</description>

Exploding a Mischievous Myth
The history of Christianity, crowded as it is with crimes of the most horrendous kind, provides a running commentary on the Christian doctrine. And the biggest share in Christian crimes down the centuries can safely be alloted to the Roman Catholic Church, its head, its hierarchy, its theologians, its religious orders, and its missionaries.
There is, however, one criminal field in which the Roman Catholic Church has remained unrivalled.</description>

      <description>23. Conclusion
 In spite of Hinduism&#39;s nominal magnitude, the chance that  Hinduism gets wiped out by its enemies can no longer be discounted. More than ever, fortunes are spent on the war to destroy Hinduism in favour of Islam or some suitably adapted variety of Christianity or Marxism. The hostile activities of Islamic and Christian agitators and the attempts at Hindu demoralization and loss of Hindu self-respect by the secularists are now compounded by a fast-spreading loss of Hindu memory at the mass level by consumerism and Western pulp media.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX II
A Glimpse of Mission Finance
The following figures of foreign funds flowing to a few of the Christian organisations in India during 1986, were provided by the Government of India. There are several hundred such organisations spread all over the country.
We have taken the figures from Hinduism Today which cited them in its issue of October, 1987:

Note: We have not tried to collect figures for more Christian organisations or subsequent years.</description>

Demystifying Islam1
Curt van den Heuvel
Why I am not a Muslim is a rare book. It is not often that one comes across Muslim apostates who are willing to openly share their views of Islam. As such, Warraq does an excellent job of demystifying Islam, and revealing it&amp;rsquo;s very human origins.
Through several chapters devoted to Muhammed and the Koran, Warraq traces the development of Islamic thought in Arabia.</description>

      <description>Great is Journalism. Is not every Able Editor a Ruler of the World, being a persuader of it ; though self-elected yet sanctioned by the sale of his Numbers ?
Thomas Carlyle
 Mr. TILAK became the declared editor of the Kesari on 22nd October 1887, and of the Mahratta on 3rd Spetember 1891. Since then, he conducted these journals as proprietor till the last, and though, the editorship was occasionally transferred to others, still he supplied the necessary inspiration, except during the intervals when he was a guest of His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s gaols.</description>

      <description>Having thus tried to trace the successive chapters of the history of the words Hindu and Hindusthan from the earliest Vedic period to the fall of the last of our Hindu empire in 1818 A. D., we are now in a position to address ourselves to the main task of determining the essentials of Hindutva. The first result of our enquiry is to explode the baseless suspicion which has crept into the minds of some of our well-meaning but hasty countrymen that the origin of the words Hindu and Hindusthan is to be traced to the malice of the Mohammedans!</description>

Ours has never been the intention of recounting and examining all the details of the Maratha movement, but only to bring out those which would enable us to ascertain the leading motive, the underlying principle, that inspired and informed it and ascertain, in that &amp;hellip; teal place in the history of our Hindu people.</description>

      <description>With the shots fired by Nathuram Vinayak Godse disappeared one of the greatest political figures from the stage of world politics. The act was committed in broad daylight, in a public place, in the sight of a multitude by a man dressed in khaki bush jacket and blue trousers. The newspapers described him as a batchelor of thirty-seven with medium height, fair skin, square jaws, a resolute and sober face, serious flickering eyes, a high forehead, close-cropped hair, all giving the appearance of a man of serious purpose.</description>

Of the universe! May the devotion,
The burning devotion of this my life
Attach itself to Him, to Shiva, who,
While being Lord of all, transcends Himself.</description>

We salute Thee!
Lord! Adored of the world,
Samsāra&amp;rsquo;s bondage breaker, taintless Thou,
Embodiment of blessed qualities,
Thou transcendest all Gunas: human form
Thus bearest.
Thee we salute and adore!
Refuge of mind and speech, Thou art beyond
The reach of either. Radiance art Thou
In all radiance that is. The heart&amp;rsquo;s cave
Is by Thy visitance resplendent made.</description>

Shed lavishly upon the homes of earth;

Murmuring rivers and brooks, rippling lakes

In earlier years, he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the readers, these volumes use the more familiar name of Vivekananda.

ALLAHABAD
5th January, 1890.
MY DEAR FAKIR, (Shri Yajneshwar Bhattacharya)
. . . A word for you. Remember always, I may not see you again. Be moral. Be brave. Be a heart-whole man. Strictly moral, brave unto desperation. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother your head with religious theories. Cowards only sin, brave men never, no, not even in mind. Try to love anybody and everybody. Be a man and try to make those immediately under your care, namely Ram, Krishnamayi, and Indu, brave, moral, and sympathising.</description>

Received your letter yesterday. Perhaps you have by this time got my letter from Japan. From Japan I reached Vancouver. The way was by the Northern Pacific. It was very cold and I suffered much for want of warm clothing. However, I reached Vancouver anyhow, and thence went through Canada to Chicago. I remained about twelve days in Chicago. And almost every day I used to go to the Fair.</description>

Thy Kingdom is the Third World1
Tempted by Satan to number Israel, King David ordered a census of his people. This angered Jehovah and He offered him three alternatives to choose from : either three years of famine, or three months of destruction at the hand of his enemies, or the three days of the Lord. Counting on the great mercies of Jehovah, David chose to fall into His hand rather than into the hand of man.</description>

Plea for Rejecting Jesus as junk
Jesus Christ has been the stock-in-trade of Christian missions down the ages. He has been packed in all shapes and sizes depending upon the gullibility of the clients to be duped. And he has been rammed down the throats of those who have refused to be hoodwinked by the hoax. As one surveys the history of Christian missions in lands where this hoax has been hawked or imposed, one comes across no end of force and fraud employed in its service by a variety of soldiers and salesmen most of whom are presented as saints.</description>

      <description>But throughout our inquiry we have been concerning ourselves more with what would have been or what should be. Not that to paint what should be is not a legitimate pursuit; nay, it is as necessary and at times more stimulating; but even that could be better done by first getting a firm hold of what actually is. We must try, therefore, to be on our guard so that in our attempt to determine the essentials of Hindutva we be guided entirely by the actual contents of the word as it stands at present.</description>

      <description>I
The story of Savarkar is the history of resistance, strife, struggle, sufferings and sacrifices for the cause of political, social and economic emai^cipation of this Bharat Varsha. His is a political career extended over fifty long years. How many of his great contemporaries could see pioneers from Ranade to philosophers like M. N. Roy, could strive for inde- pendence of India and yet have the good fortune to see the sun of freedom rise over India ?</description>

The Problem is not Islamic Fundamentalism but Islam itself1
Taslima Nasreen
In the wake of the Rushdie Affair, a report in The New York Times (February 27, 1989) voiced a common fear: &amp;ldquo;Ayotollah Khomeini has probably succeeded in preventing publication in this country of books critical of Muslims and Islam.&amp;rdquo; This prophecy has proved, fortunately wrong, witness the writings of Anwar Shaikh that have earned him a fatwa from the mullahs in Pakistan, or Dr.</description>

      <description>To me it (i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant because it appeared in the midst of the author&amp;rsquo;s direst persecution when money reputation, influence and everything were at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles.

 The scholar in politics is either a remarkable failure or an extraordinary success. In the scholar&amp;rsquo;s temperament, hesitency, lack of strong will-power, im- patience and petulance usually form the chief mgrcdi- ents.</description>

      <description>V CHICAGO,
2nd November, 1893.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I am so sorry that a moment&amp;rsquo;s weakness on my part should cause you so much trouble; I was out of pocket at that time. Since then the Lord sent me friends. At a village near Boston I made the acquaintance of Dr. Wright, Professor of Greek in the Harvard University. He sympathised with me very much and urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give me an introduction to the nation.</description>

DEAR HARIPADA, (Haripada Mitra)
It is very strange that news of my Chicago lectures has appeared in the Indian papers; for whatever I do, I try my best to avoid publicity. Many things strike me here. It may be fairly said that there is no poverty in this country. I have never seen women elsewhere as cultured and educated as they are here.</description>

DEAR FRIENDS, (His disciples in Madras)
Your letters have reached me. I am surprised that so much about me has reached you. The criticism you mention of the Interior is not to be taken as the attitude of the American people. That paper is almost unknown here, and belongs to what they call a &amp;ldquo;blue-nose Presbyterian paper&amp;rdquo;, very bigoted.</description>

9th April, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I got your last letter a few days ago. You see I am so very busy here, and have to write so many letters every day, that you cannot expect frequent communications from me. But I try my best to keep you in touch with whatever is going on here. I will write to Chicago for one of the books on the Parliament of Religions to be sent over to you.</description>

MY DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA),
I am in receipt of your letter and am glad to learn that Shashi (Ramakrishnananda) is all right. Now I tell you a curious fact. Whenever anyone of you is sick, let him himself or anyone of you visualise him in your mind, and mentally say and strongly imagine that he is all right. That will cure him quickly. You can do it even without his knowledge, and even with thousands of miles between you.</description>

28th May, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
I could not reply to your note earlier, because I was whirling to and fro from New York to Boston, and also I awaited Narasimha&amp;rsquo;s letter. I do not know when I am going back to India. It is better to leave everything in the hands of Him who is at my back directing me. Try to work without me, as if I never existed.</description>

11th July, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
You must never write to me anywhere else but 541 Dearborn Ave., Chicago. Your last letter has travelled the whole country to come to me, and this was only because I am so well known. Some of the resolutions are to be sent to Dr. Barrows with a letter thanking him for his kindness to me and asking him to publish the letter in some American newspapers — as that would be the best refutation of the false charges of the missionaries that I do not represent anybody.</description>

Your very kind letter duly reached me at Annisquam. I am with the Bagleys once more. They are kind as usual. Professor Wright was not here. But he came day before yesterday and we have very nice time together. Mr. Bradley of Evanston, whom you have met at Evanston, was here. His sister-in-law had me sit for a picture several days and had painted me.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
I just now saw an editorial on me about the circular from Madras in the Boston Transcript. Nothing has reached me yet. They will reach me soon if you have sent them already. So far you have done wonderfully, my boy. Do not mind what I write in some moments of nervousness. One gets nervous sometimes alone in a country 15,000 miles from home, having to fight every inch of ground with orthodox inimical Christians.</description>

21st September, 1894.
DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I have been continuously travelling from place to place and working incessantly, giving lectures, holding classes, etc.
I have not been able to write yet for my proposed book. Perhaps I may be able to take it in hand later on. I have made some nice friends here amongst the liberal people, and a few amongst the orthodox. I hope to return soon to India — I have had enough of this country and especially as too much work is making me nervous.</description>

 First Document
With reference to Dr. Godbole’s analysis of the eight conceptions of the so-called Hindu Organizations regarding the Muslim Problem, his first two responsive comments reiterate the fact that Cults of Uniformism masquerading as religions are bound to be imperialist aggressors.
Regarding the third conception – ‘Islam is good but Muslims are bad’ - Dr Godbole has rightly reiterated that the difficulty resides in the Cult that is fundamental to the group consciousness of the Muslims.</description>

      <description>23
Encounter with Arun Shourie
Missiology is a meticulous discipline developed quite early in the history of Christianity as auxiliary to an exclusivist and aggressive doctrine - Jesus Christ is the only saviour; there is no salvation outside the Church; and infidels should be compelled to come in. By now the discipline has become rather rich with experience gained over several centuries and in all parts of the world. Many universities in Europe and the Americas teach Missiology in their faculties of Catholic and Protestant theologies.</description>

      <description>The reason that explains why the term Hindu cannot be synonymous with Bharatiya or Hindi and mean an Indian only, naturally introduces us to the second essential implication of that term. The Hindus are not merely the citizens of the Indian state because they are united not only by the bonds of the love they bear to a common motherland but also by the bonds of a common blood. They are not only a Nation but also a race-jati.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Go into the world and preach the gospel to all creatures.

Christian scholars now know this biblical passage to be an interpolation but this fact has in no way cooled off their zeal for proselytizing.</description>

The book Why I am Not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq is a nice aggregate of learning, intellect and courage. I was delighted when its author paid me a visit in the early part of 1997. During the conversation, I was impressed by his motive and mastery of the subject.
Ibn Warraq is the pen-name of the author whose parents emigrated from India to Pakistan as a result of the Partition.</description>

DEAR KIDI,
I am very sorry to hear your determination of giving up the world so soon. The fruit falls from the tree when it gets ripe. So wait for the time to come. Do not hurry. Moreover, no one has the right to make others miserable by his foolish acts. Wait, have patience, everything will come right in time.
Yours with blessings,</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)
Your letter with the India mail just to hand. A quantity of newspaper clippings were sent over to me from India. I send them back for your perusal and safe keeping.
I am busy writing letters to India last few days. I will remain a few days more in Boston.
With my love and blessings,
Yours ever affly.,

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . One thing I find in the books of my speeches and sayings published in Calcutta. Some of them are printed in such a way as to savour of political views; whereas I am no politician or political agitator. I care only for the Spirit — when that is right everything will be righted by itself&amp;hellip;. So you must warn the Calcutta people that no political significance be ever attached falsely to any of my writings or sayings.</description>

You all have done well, my brave unselfish children. I am so proud of you. . . . Hope and do not despair. After such a start, if you despair you are a fool. . . .
Our field is India, and the value of foreign appreciation is in rousing India up. That is all. . . . We must have a strong base from which to spread.</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)
Excuse my long silence; but I have been regularly writing to Mother Church. I am sure you are all enjoying this nice cool weather. I am enjoying Baltimore and Washington very much. I will go hence to Philadelphia. I thought Miss Mary was in Philadelphia, and so I wanted her address. But as she is in some other place near Philadelphia, I do not want to give her the trouble to come up to see me, as Mother Church says.</description>

I am glad to leant that the phonograph and the letter have reached you safely. You need not send any more newspaper cuttings. I have been deluged with them. Enough of that. Now go to work for the organisation. I have started one already in New York and the Vice-President will soon write to you. Keep correspondence with them.

DEAR KIDI,
. . . As to the wonderful stories published about Shri Ramakrishna, I advise you to keep clear of them and the fools who write them. They are true, but the fools will make a mess of the whole thing, I am sure. He had a whole world of knowledge to teach, why insist upon unnecessary things as miracles really are! They do not prove anything.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED, (Alasinga Perumal)
. . . In reference to me every now and then attacks are made in missionary papers (so I hear), but I never care to see them. If you send any of those made in India, I should throw them into the waste-paper basket. A little agitation was necessary for our work. We have had enough. Pay no more attention to what people say about me, whether good or bad.</description>

 Dr. S. Godbole’s comments at a Seminar in Pune and his letter to Shri K.S. Sudarshan, published by the Voice of India in the form of a brochure titled Time for Stock Taking, raise issues of vital importance to the Majority population of Hindus in the country. There are many minority groups in India. But except the Muslims, they pose no serious problem. The Muslim position has been intractable both before and after Partition.</description>

Fixing a Christian Windbag
The United States of America is a land of sharp contradictions when it comes to matters of faith. On the one hand, it is the land of Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, James Madison and Mark Twain who distrusted or denounced or ridiculed the Christian dogma and scripture in unmistakable words. On the other hand, it is the land of the most fanatical and fundamentalist Christian sects each one of which will have not only the USA but the whole world exclusively for itself.</description>

Islam is religious fascism1
Ibn Al-Rawandi
Why I am not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq
(Prometheus Books, £ 15 to RPA members).
In one of his early works the traditionalist writer Frithjof Schuon makes an acute observation about the mentality of Muslims: &amp;ldquo;The intellectual - and thereby the rational - foundation of Islam results in the average Muslim having a curious tendency to believe that non-Muslims either know that Islam is the truth and reject it out of pure obstinacy, or else are simply ignorant of it and can be converted by elementary explanations; that anyone should be able to oppose Islam with a good conscience quite exceeds the Muslim&amp;rsquo;s power of imagination, precisely because Islam coincides in his mind with the irresistible logic of things.</description>

      <description>APPENDIX V
Proselytisation as it is Practised1
I did not realise I was stirring a hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest in reviewing the Mission Handbook (March 13, 14). It invoked many rejoinders, most of them harsh. It helps inter-faith dialogue which the church has recently invited.
Many points have been made but, quite understandably I can only deal with a few more salient ones, and that too briefly. Mr Kuruvilla Chandy presents a justification for Christian proselytizing which is novel in its being so openly avowed.</description>

      <description>But what is civilization ? Civilization is the expression of the mind of man. Civilization is the account of what man has made of matter. If matter is the creation of the Lord, then civilization is the miniature secondary creation of man. At its best it is the perfect triumph of the soul of man over matter and man alike. Wherever and to the extent to which man has succeeded in moulding matter to the delight of his soul, civilization begins.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
Your letter just to hand. . . . I was mistaken in asking you to publish the scraps I sent you. It was one of my awful mistakes. It shows a moment&amp;rsquo;s weakness. Money can be raised in this country by lecturing for two or three years.

DEAR ALASINGA,
Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road saw an old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire of him the whereabouts of a certain place. &amp;ldquo;How far is such and such a village?&amp;rdquo; he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the traveller turned to go away.</description>

I lectured at Brooklyn last Sunday, Mrs. Higgins gave a little reception the evening I arrived, and some of the prominent members of the Ethical Society including Dr. Jain [Janes] were there. Some of them thought that such Oriental religious subjects will not interest the Brooklyn public.

      <description>XXXI BROOKLYN,
20th January, 1895.
(Written to Mrs. Ole Bull whom Swamiji called &amp;ldquo;Dhirā Mātā&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;Steady Mother&amp;rdquo; on the occasion of the loss of her father.)
. . . I had a premonition of your father&amp;rsquo;s giving up the old body and it is not my custom to write to anyone when a wave of would-be inharmonious Māyā strikes him. But these are the great turning points in life, and I know that you are unmoved.</description>

1st February, 1895.
DEAR SISTER (Miss Mary Hale)
I just received your beautiful note&amp;hellip;. Well, sometimes it is a good discipline to be forced to work for work&amp;rsquo;s sake, even to the length of not being allowed to enjoy the fruits of one&amp;rsquo;s labour&amp;hellip;. I am very glad of your criticisms and am not sorry at all. The other day at Miss Thursby&amp;rsquo;s I had an excited argument with a Presbyterian gentleman, who, as usual, got very hot, angry, and abusive.</description>

      <description>XXXIII 19 W., 38 ST.,
NEW YORK, 1895.
DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . Meddle not with so-called social reform, for there cannot be any reform without spiritual reform first. Who told you that I want social reform? Not I. Preach the Lord — say neither good nor bad about the superstitions and diets. Do not lose heart, do not lose faith in your Guru, do not lose faith in God. So long as you possess these three, nothing can harm you, my child.</description>

DEAR SISTER,1
I am sorry you had an attack of illness. I will give you an absent treatment though your confession takes half the strength out of my mind.
That you have rolled put of it is all right. All&amp;rsquo;s well that ends well.
The books have arrived in good condition and many thanks for them.
Your ever affectionate bro.,

      <description>24. Professor R. R. Mangasuli
 No organization has so far found any solution to merge the Muslims in India with Hindu society. National Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Janata Dal and such parties have only succeeded in increasing the rift between the two creeds and making Muslims more stubborn. Muslims are like an idiotic son of negligent parents. Careful attention only can correct him. Muslim as an individual is quite accommodative like other human beings.</description>

Calling the Pope’s Bluff
The Papacy started as a crimes cartel which it has remained throughout its long career. But the collapse of Christianity in the West and the retreat of Western imperialism has forced it to change its methods, and function more and more like a multinational corporation. Buyers for its stale and discredited merchandise -Jesus Christ, the only son of the only God and the only saviour from eternal perdition - are becoming increasingly scarce, and it is no more in a position to thrust the garbage down people’s throats.</description>

      <description>Common institutions and a common law that sanctions and sanctifies them, however they may differ in details are nevertheless both the cause and the effect of the basic unity of our race. The Hindu law with the underlying principles of Hindu jurisprudence whatever the superficial differences be and howsoever contradictory a detail here or an injunction there may seem to be, is too organic a growth to lose its individuality by the manifold changes wrought by times and climes.</description>

Ibn Warraq grew up in a Muslim family. Islam is a jealous religion so that any man who grew up in a Muslim family and is, for that reason considered a Muslim, not by his own volition, has to remain a Muslim for life, or else he is sentenced to death, and this sentence will be carried out as soon as a Muslim assassin can get him in the crossed hairs.</description>

      <description>( Appendix A and B will give the reader an idea of the principal arguments advanced by Mr. Tilak in the Orion and the Arctic Home in the Vedas to establish his theories. The Gita-Rahasya being com- paratively a recent production is too well-known to require any summary. )
Oriental scholars have advanced vague and uncertain conjectures about the age and character of the Vedas. Prof. Max Muller has divided the Vedic literature into four arbitrary periods, the Chhandas, Mantra, Brahmana and Sutra and by assigning two hundred years for each period he arrives at about 1200 B.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . Do not for a moment think the &amp;ldquo;Yankees&amp;rdquo; are practical in religion. In that the Hindu alone is practical, the Yankee in money-making, so that as soon as I depart, the whole thing will disappear. Therefore I want to have a solid ground under my feet before I depart. Every work should be made thorough. . . . You need not insist upon preaching Shri Ramakrishna.</description>

So you have made up your mind to renounce the world. I have sympathy with your desire. There is nothing so high as renunciation of self. But you must not forget that to forgo your own favourite desire for the welfare of those that depend upon you is no small sacrifice. Follow the spotless life and teachings of Shri Ramakrishna and look after the comforts of your family.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
I received your missionary book and the Ramnad photos. I have written to the Raja as well as the Dewan at Mysore. The missionary pamphlet must have reached here long ago, as the Ramabai circle controversy with Dr. Janes savoured of it, it seems. Now you need not be afraid of anything. There is one misstatement in that pamphlet. I never went to a big hotel in this country, and very few times to any other.</description>

 Before going into the questions raised by Dr. Godbole, let us understand the stage where we stand and discuss.
In today’s Bharath, a Hindu is a Hindu because his father is a Hindu. So is the case with a Muslim or a Christian. Generally, nobody knows or even bothers to know the guiding principles of one’s own faith, leave alone understanding someone else’s faith. Hindus go to temples, perform some rituals (of which they do not have any understanding) and claim to be devout Hindus.</description>

      <description>Up to the middle of the 19th century, myths and traditions were the only materials available for the study of pre-historic man. So various attempts were made to systematise these myths and explain them ra- tionally. But the mythologists carried on their re- searches at a time when man was believed to be post- glacial and when the physical and geographical sur- roundings of the ancient man were assumed not to have been materially different from those of the present day.</description>

Dear Sir,
The following are replies to the questionnaire you sent I am sorry I am not in a position to answer all the questions.

      <description>The words Hindutva and Hinduism both of them being derived from the word Hindu, must necessarily be understood to refer to the whole of the Hindu people. Any definition of Hinduism that leaves out any important section of our people and forces them either to play false to their convictions or to go outside the pale of Hindutva stands self- condemned. Hinduism means the system of religious beliefs found common amongst the Hindu people.</description>

DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Betty Sturges.)
I am sure you are in New York by this time, and that it is not very hot there now.
We are having great times here. Marie Louise arrived yesterday. So we are exactly seven now including all that have come yet.
All the sleep of the world has come upon me. I sleep at least two hours during the day and sleep through the whole night as a piece of log.</description>

I had two beautiful letters from Miss MacLeod and Mrs. Sturges. Also they sent over two pretty birch bark books. I have filled them with Sanskrit texts and translations, and they go by today&amp;rsquo;s post.</description>

I have planted a seed in this country; it is already a plant, and I expect it to be a tree very soon. I have got a few hundred followers. I shall make several Sannyāsins, and then I go to India leaving the work to them.</description>

I wrote you before this a letter, but as I am afraid it was not posted carefully, I write another.
I shall be in time before the 14th. I shall have to come to New York before the 11th anyway. So there will be time enough to get ready.
I shall go with you to Paris, for my principal object in going with you is to see you married.</description>

By the time this reaches you, dear Alasinga, I shall be in Paris. . . . I have done a good deal of work this year and hope to do a good deal more in the next. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother about the missionaries. It is quite natural that they should cry. Who does not when his bread is dwindling away? The missionary funds have got a big gap the last two years, and it is on the increase.</description>

I shall have to stop here with him till that time; and after that I shall be free to come to London.

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I am surprised you take so seriously the missionaries&#39; nonsense. . . . If the people in India want me to keep strictly to my Hindu diet, please tell them to send me a cook and money enough to keep him. This silly bossism without a mite of real help makes me laugh. On the other hand, if the missionaries tell you that I have ever broken the two great vows of the Sannyāsin — chastity and poverty — tell them that they are big liars.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . In England my work is really splendid, I am astonished myself at it. The English people do not: talk much in the newspapers, but they work silently. I am sure of more work in England than in America. Bands and bands come, and I have no room for so many; so they squat on the floor, ladies and all. I tell them to imagine that they are under the sky of India, under a spreading banyan, and they like the idea.</description>

 I entirely agree with Dr. Shreerang Godbole’s view on the likelihood of confusion being created by the leaders of the Sangh Parivar, owing to its contradictory stances on its approach towards the Muslim problem. The Mantra of “Sarvadharmasamabhãva” has clogged the mind of Hindu leaders for too long. Firstly, how many of these leaders who have interiorized this concept can claim to be aware of the tenets of Christianity and Islam which have time and again wreaked havoc on Hindu Society?</description>

      <description>The rough analysis to which the conception of Hindutva was subjected in the foregoing pages has enabled us to frame a working definition embodying or rather indicating the salient essentials of it. It now remains to see how far this general definition can stand a detailed examination that could be best conducted by testing a few typical and some of the most different cases which have in fact made the necessity of a definition so badly felt.</description>

About the Sannyāsin coming over from India, I am sure he will help you in the translation work, also in other work. Later on, when I come, I may send him over to America.

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . I have used some very harsh words in my letters, which you ought to excuse, as you know, I get nervous at times. The work is terribly hard; and the more it is growing, the harder it is becoming. I need a long rest very badly. Yet a great work is before me in England.
Have patience, my son — it will grow beyond all your expectations.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . One of my new Sannyāsins is indeed a woman. . . . The others are men. I am going to make some more in England and take them over to India with me. These &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; faces will have more influence in India than the Hindus; moreover, they are vigorous, the Hindus are dead. The only hope of India is from the masses.</description>

March, 1896.
DEAR ALASINGA,
. . . Push on with the work. I will do all I can. . . . If it pleases the Lord, yellow-garbed Sannyāsins will be common here and in England. Work on, my children.
Mind, so long as you have faith in your Guru, nothing will be able to obstruct your way. That translation of the three Bhāshyas (commentaries) will be a great thing in the eyes of the Westerners.</description>

DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,
I received your note this morning. As I am sailing for England tomorrow, I can only write a few hearty lines. I have every sympathy with your proposed magazine for boys, and will do my best to help it on. You ought to make it independent, following the same lines as the Brahmavādin, only making the style and matter much more popular.</description>

14th July, 1896.
DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,
The numbers of Prabuddha Bharata have been received and distributed too to the class. It is very satisfactory. It will have a great sale, no doubt, in India. In America I may get also a number of subscribers. I have already arranged for advertising it in America and Goodyear has done it already. But here in England the progress will be slower indeed.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
I learnt from your letter the bad financial state the Brahmavādin is in. I will try to help you when I go back to London. You must not lower the tone. Keep up the paper. Very soon I will be able to help you in such a manner as to make you free of this nonsense teacher business. Do not be afraid. Great things are going to be done, my child.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
Since writing to you a few days ago I have found my way to let you know that I am in a position to do this for the Brahmavadin. I will give you Rs. 100 a month for a year or two, i.e. £60 or £70 a year, i.e. as much as would cover Rs. 100 a month. That will set you free to work for the Brahmavadin and make it a better success.</description>

 Thanks for mailing the small but thought provoking pamphlet “TIME FOR STOCK TAKING”. I very much appreciate your gesture of inviting the responses from the Hindu Mind.
1. The Indian National Congress from the very inception was not for the welfare of Hindusthan and its citizens, especially the Hindus and their culture, but for the unhindered continuation of the British rule. Pseudo-Nationalist leaders steeped in Western culture took over and gave the call of Nationalism, which was taken up by the common man and became a mass frenzied Nationalism, an outcome of the Westernised Indian leaders.</description>

      <description>So far we have not allowed any considerations of utility to prejudice our inquiry. But having come to its end it will not be out of place to see how far the attributes, which we found to be the essentials of Hindutva, contribute towards the strength, cohesion, and progress of our people. Do these essentials constitute a foundation so broad, so deep, so strong that basing upon it the Hindu people can build a future which can face and repel the attacks of all the adverse winds that blow ; or does the Hindu race stand on feet of clay ?</description>

Today I received a letter from India written by Abhedānanda that in all probability he had started on the 11th August by the B.I.S.N., &amp;ldquo;S.S.Mombassa&amp;rdquo;. He could not get an earlier steamer; else he would have started earlier. In all probability he would be able to secure a passage on the Mombassa. The Mombassa will reach London about the 15th of September.</description>

DEAR NANJUNDA RAO,
I have just now got your letter. I am on the move. I have been doing a great deal of mountain-climbing and glacier-crossing in the Alps. Now I am going to Germany. I have an invitation from Prof. Deussen to visit him at Kiel. From thence I go back to England. Possibly I will return to India this winter.
What I objected to in the design for the Prabuddha Bhārata was not only its tawdriness, but the crowding in of a number of figures without any purpose.</description>

DEAR MADAM, (An American lady.)
We have only to grasp the idea of gradation of morality and everything becomes clear.
Renunciation — non-resistance — non-destructiveness — are the ideals to be attained through less and less worldliness, less and less resistance, less and less destructiveness. Keep the ideal in view and work towards it. None can live in the world without resistance, without destruction, without desire.</description>

I feel much obliged for the Bhārati sent by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause, to which my humble life has been dedicated, has been able to win the approbation off highly talented ladies like you.
In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the initiator off new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land.</description>

 I refer to the document “Time For Stock Taking”. I am surprised that the Sangh Parivar has been popularizing these eight slogans. Obviously, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar have not read either the Bible or the Quran. If they had read them, they would not be making such ridiculous statements. With friends like these, Hindus do not need enemies.

1. We have kept no such record as we do not recognize castes.
2. A small rise in the population of our Church is mostly due to natural increase.
3. Out of about 4,000 members in our Church, at present, about 94 per cent are born Christians (i.e., 240 converts).
4. In our churches in the districts of Sagar, Chhindwara, Betul and Baikunthpur tahsil, 154 converts have been admitted into our fold since 1947.</description>

      <description>LXXV ALMORA,
29th May, 1897.
MY DEAR DOCTOR SHASHI (BHUSHAN GHOSH),
Your letter and the two bottles containing the medicines were duly received. I have begun from last evening a trial of your medicines. Hope the combination will have a better effect than the one alone.
I began to take a lot of exercise on horseback, both morning and evening. Since that I am very much better indeed. I was so much better the first week of my gymnastics that I have scarcely felt so well since I was a boy and used to have kusti (wrestling) exercises.</description>

DEAR MR.—,
The objections you show about the Vedas would be valid if the word Vedas meant Samhitās. The word Vedas includes the three parts, the Samhitas, the Brāhmanas, and the Upanishads, according to the universally received opinion in India. Of these, the first two portions, as being the ceremonial parts, have been nearly put out of sight; the Upanishads have alone been taken up by all our philosophers and founders of sects.</description>

Many many thanks for your beautiful and kind letter. I wish I were in London to be able to accept the invitation with the Raja of Khetri. I had a great many dinners to attend in London last season. But it was fated not to be, and my health did not permit my going over with the Raja.
So Alberta is once more at home in America.</description>

MY DEAR JAGAMOHANLAL,
. . . Leave words when you start for Bombay to somebody to take care of three Sannyasins I am sending to Jaipur. Give them food and good lodging. They will be there till I come. They are fellows — innocent, not learned. They belong to me, and one is my Gurubhāi (brother-disciple). If they like, take them to Khetri where I will come soon.</description>

The move is quite original, and never was the life of a great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the writer&amp;rsquo;s mind, as you are presenting this one. The language also is beyond all praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy.
I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the leaflets. I am really in a transport when I read them.</description>

I am starting for Kashmir on Saturday next. I have your letter of introduction to the Resident, but better still if you kindly drop a line to the Resident telling him that you have already given an introduction to me.
Will you kindly ask Jagamohan to write to the Dewan of Kishangarh reminding him of his promise to supply me with copies of Nimbārka Bhāshya on the Vyāsa-Sutras and other Bhashyas (commentaries) through his Pandits.</description>

I have been very ill here for two weeks. Now getting better. I am in want of funds. Though the American; friends are doing everything they can to help me, I feel shame to beg from them all the time, especially as illness makes one incur contingent expenses. I have no shame; to beg of one person in the world and that is yourself.</description>

      <description>29. Virendra V. Parekh
 Dr. Shreerang Godbole has issued a timely warning against cosy soporific slogans currently mouthed by leaders of some prominent Hindu organisations. His documents display a clarity of mind and courage of conviction that is rare among Hindu intellectuals.
While one agrees entirely with the tone and tenor of the documents, some of Dr. Godbole’s formulations need improvement. It is sufficient to say that the openness of Hinduism should not be misused to sanction those dogmas of other religious groups which breed exclusiveness, intolerance and aggressiveness.</description>

      <description>Rishi, Muni, or God — none has power to force an institution on society. When the needs of the times press hard on it, society adopts certain customs for self-preservation. Rishis have only recorded those customs As a man often resorts even to such means as are good for immediate self-protection but which are very injurious in the future, similarly society also not unfrequently saves itself for the time being, but these immediate means which contributed to its preservation turn out to be terrible in the long run.</description>

. . . Life is a series of fights and disillusionments. . . . The secret of life is not enjoyment, but education through experience. But, alas, we are called off the moment we begin really to learn. That seems to be a potent argument for a future existence. . . . Everywhere it is better to have a whirlwind come over the work.</description>

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Ole Bull.)
I send you forthwith a translation of the Nāsadiya Hymn sent by Dr. Bose through you. I have tried to make it as literal as possible.
I hope Dr. Bose has recovered his health perfectly by this time.
Mrs. Sevier is a strong woman, and has borne her loss quietly and bravely.</description>

 I am replying to the issues raised by your brochure.
1. The doctrine of Islam is Unity. The Koran say that Allah is one and alone, without a second. In Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God, which means he is second to God. Thus other men cannot be sons of God and will go to Heaven or Hell for ever, not according to their actions but on the recommendations of Jesus.</description>

MY DEAR STURDY,
I learn from Saradananda that you have sent over Rs. 1,529-5-5 to the Math, being the money that was in hand for work in England. I am sure it will be rightly used.
Capt. Sevier passed away about three months ago. They have made a fine place here in the mountains and Mrs. Sevier means to keep it up. I am on a visit to her, and I may possibly come over to England with her.</description>

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Ole Bull)
Many thanks for your very encouraging words. I needed them very much just now. The gloom has not lifted with the advent of the new century, it is visibly thickening. I went to see Mrs. Sevier at Mayavati. On my way I learnt of the sudden death of the Raja of Khetri. It appears he was restoring some old architectural monument at Agra, at his own expense, and was up some tower on inspection.</description>

Sometimes it is hard work to be tied to the shoestrings of a great name. And that was just what happened to my letter. You wrote on the 22nd January, 1901. You tied me to the latchet of a great name, Miss MacLeod. Consequently the letter has been following her up and down the world.</description>

      <description>Reading your letter I felt like laughing, and also rather sorry. The cause of the laughter is that you had a dream through indigestion and made yourself miserable, taking it to be real. The cause of my sorrow is that it is clear from this that your health is not good, and that your nerves require rest very badly.
Never have I laid a curse on you, and why should I do so now?</description>

 We cannot be sufficiently grateful to Dr. Godbole for having questioned the validity of a thesis advanced by the BJP think-tank and its allied organisations with a view to creating a constituency among the Indian Muslims who form barely 12% of the total population of India. The BJP brains trust has devised an agenda of which the eight formulations pointed out by Dr. Godbole form the core.</description>

I wish to present a few statements in answer to the questionnaire your office has circulated regarding the activities of missionaries.
69. There is one Mission Hospital in the Yeotmal district. It is a general hospital known as Umri Mission Hospital. It was started in July 1951.
79. Admission is allowed to all depending only on limitation of accommodations available and services available.</description>

I am so glad you are enjoying Japan — especially Japanese art. You are perfectly correct in saying that we will have to learn many things from Japan. The help that Japan will give us will be with great sympathy and respect, whereas that from the West unsympathetic and destructive.

      <description>I had to consult Brahmananda and others, and they were everyone in Calcutta, hence the delay in replying to your last.
The idea of taking a house for a whole year must be worked out with deliberation. As on the one hand there is some risk of catching malaria in Belur this month, in Calcutta on the other hand there is the danger of plague. Then again one is sure to avoid fever if one takes good care not to go into the interior of this village, the immediate bank of the river being entirely free from fever.</description>

      <description>. There are references, though in Buddhistic literature, to Vedanta, and the Mahāyāna school of Buddhism is even Advaitistic. Why does Amara Singha, a Buddhist, give as one of the names of Buddha — Advayavādi ? Charu writes, the word Brahman does not occur in the Upanishads! Quelle bêtise!
I hold the Mahayana to be the older of the two schools of Buddhism.
The theory of Māyā is as old as the Rik-Samhitā.</description>

 Thanks for sending the booklet ‘Time for Stock Taking’. I have noted that the author has shown his utmost concern regarding the ‘Hindu-Muslim’ problem nagging the country even after partition in a new form, i.e., Secularism vs. Communalism, and the Congress policy of appeasement of Muslims going on merrily as before with help of its allies (Communists, Casteists and Communalists) to the detriment of the Majority community.</description>

Sir,
We, the undersigned members of the Independent Christian Laymen Association, Yeotmal, beg to answer some of the questions, out of the questionnaire set up by the Committee.
1. The General Missionary Secretary of Free Methodist Mission had paid a visit to Yeotmal in the year 1948 and we other, Christians who do not work for the Mission had put a representation, dated April 4, 1948, before him explaining him how Christians like us are treated by the Missionaries, vide paragraph 2 of our letter quoted above (original and copy enclosed).</description>

Welcome to India once more, dear mother (Mrs. Ole Bull) and daughter. A copy of a Madras journal that I received through the kindness of Joe delighted me exceedingly, as the reception Niveditā had in Madras was for the good of both Nivedita and Madras. Her speech was indeed beautiful.
I hope you are resting well after your long journey, and so is Nivedita.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL, (Swami Brahmananda.)
I was glad to get all the detailed news from your letter. Regarding Nivedita&amp;rsquo;s School, I have written to her what I have to say. My opinion is that she should do what she considers to be best.
Don&amp;rsquo;t ask my opinion on any other matter either. That makes me lose my temper.</description>

DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)
It seems the plan of going to Japan seems to have come to nought. Mrs. Bull is gone, you are going. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the Japanese.
Sadananda has accompanied the Japanese to Nepal along with Kanai. Christine could not start earlier, as Margot could not go till the end of this month.
I am getting on splendidly, they say, but yet very weak and no water to drink.</description>

      <description>. . . In my opinion, a race must first cultivate a great respect for motherhood, through the sanctification and inviolability of marriage, before it can attain to the ideal of perfect chastity. The Roman Catholics and the Hindus, holding marriage sacred and inviolate, have produced great chaste men and women of immense power. To the Arab, marriage is a contract or a forceful possession, to be dissolved at will, and we do not find there the development of the idea of the virgin or the Brahmachārin.</description>

 After Kumbhakarna had practised severe austerities, Brahmã appeared before him and said, “I am pleased with your tapasyã, what boon would you have?”
“God, give me plenty of sleep: good, long sleep, for I enjoy it most!” replied Kumbhakarna.
“So be it,” blessed Brahmã and disappeared.
And thereafter, goes the story, Kumbhakarna used to sleep for six months at a stretch, wake up for a day to eat and drink, and go back to sleep for another six months.</description>

Dear Sirs,

First, it seems to me that the tone, as well as the character, of some questions reflects the attitude that the Christian position is weak and open to suspicion in certain fundamental respects.</description>

Indian philosophy has in recent years had a deep and growing fascination for many minds, though up to the present time its exponents in this country have been entirely Western in their thought and training, with the result that very little is really known of the deeper mysteries of the Vedanta wisdom, and that little only by a select few.</description>

      <description>INDIA AND ENGLAND (India, London, 1896)
During the London season, Swami Vivekananda has been teaching and lecturing to considerable numbers of people who have been attracted by his doctrine and philosophy. Most English people fancy that England has the practical monopoly of missionary enterprise, almost unbroken save for a small effort on the part of France. I therefore sought the Swami in his temporary home in South Belgravia to enquire what message India could possibly send to England, apart from the remonstrances she has too often had to make on the subject of home charges, judicial and executive functions combined in one person, the settlement of expenses connected with Sudanese and other expeditions.</description>

. . . I presume that in his own country the Swami would live under a tree, or at most in the precincts of a temple, his head shaved, dressed in the costume of his country. But these things are not done in London, so that I found the Swami located much like other people, and, save that he wears a long coat of a dark orange shade, dressed like other mortals likewise.</description>

Q. — The theory that the universe is false seems to be understood in the following senses: (a) the sense in which the duration of perishing forms and names is infinitesimally small with reference to eternity; (b) the sense in which the period between any two Pralayas (involution of the universe) is infinitesimally small with reference to eternity; (c) the sense in which the universe is ultimately false though it has an apparent reality at present, depending upon one sort of consciousness, in the same way as the idea of silver superimposed on a shell or that of a serpent on a rope, is true for the time being, and, in effect, is dependent upon a particular condition of mind; (d) the sense in which the universe is a phantom just like the son of a barren woman or like the horns of a hare.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Aggression,&amp;rdquo; said the Swami promptly, &amp;ldquo;aggression in a religious sense only.

      <description>ON INDIAN WOMEN — THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE (Prabuddha Bharata, December, 1898)
It was early one Sunday morning, writes our representative, in a beautiful Himalayan valley, that I was at last able to carry out the order of the Editor, and call on the Swami Vivekananda, to ascertain something of his views on the position and prospects of Indian Women.
&amp;ldquo;Let us go for a walk&amp;rdquo;, said the Swami, when I had announced my errand, and we set out at once amongst some of the most lovely scenery in the world.</description>

      <description>ON THE BOUNDS OF HINDUISM (Prabuddha Bharata, April, 1899)
Having been directed by the Editor, writes our representative, to interview Swami Vivekananda on the question of converts to Hinduism, I found an opportunity one evening on the roof of a Ganga houseboat. It was after nightfall, and we had stopped at the embankment of the Ramakrishna Math, and there the Swami came down to speak with me.
Time and place were alike delightful.</description>

 First Document:
 1. Muhammad is Allah’s messenger, and a mortal human being. Hence he is only an intermediary, which is also the claim made by his votaries. Some sentimental Hindus may have no objection to count him as a saint. But there is no question of his being included in the category of Hindu Gods.
Jesus is considered as the Son of God. But according to Christian belief, he presented himself as a martyr for the sake of humanity.</description>

Dear Sir,
Since I am not a mission or Church employee I am not in a position to give a precise answer to most of the questions asked. Therefore, I shall give my reaction to the questionnaire in general terms. Wherever possible I shall also answer the questions, according to their serial number.</description>

      <description>ON KARMA-YOGA Isolation of the soul from all objects, mental and physical, is the goal; when that is attained, the soul will find that it was alone all the time, and it required no one to make it happy. As long as we require someone else to make us happy, we are slaves. When the Purusha finds that It is free, and does not require anything to complete Itself, that this nature is quite unnecessary, then freedom (Kaivalya) is attained.</description>

      <description>ON FANATICISM There are fanatics of various kinds. Some people are wine fanatics and cigar fanatics. Some think that if men gave up smoking cigars, the world would arrive at the millennium. Women are generally amongst these fanatics. There was a young lady here one day, in this class. She was one of a number of ladies in Chicago who have built a house where they take in the working people and give them music and gymnastics.</description>

A ship is said to have passed over a mountain of magnet ore, and all the bolts and bars were drawn out, and it went to pieces. It is in ignorance that struggle remains, because we are all really atheists. Real theists cannot work. We are atheists more or less. We do not see God or believe in Him.</description>

      <description>WORK WITHOUT MOTIVE At the forty-second meeting of the Ramakrishna Mission held at the premises No. 57 Rāmkānta Bose Street, Baghbazar, Calcutta, on the 20th March, 1898, Swami Vivekananda gave an address on &amp;ldquo;Work without Motive&amp;rdquo;, and spoke to the following effect:
When the Gita was first preached, there was then going on a great controversy between two sects. One party considered the Vedic Yajnas and animal sacrifices and such like Karmas to constitute the whole of religion.</description>

      <description>SADHANAS OR PREPARATIONS FOR HIGHER LIFE If atavism gains, you go down; if evolution gains, you go on. Therefore, we must not allow atavism to take place. Here, in my own body, is the first work of the study. We are too busy trying to mend the ways of our neighbours, that is the difficulty. We must begin with our own bodies. The heart, the liver, etc., are all atavistic; bring them back into consciousness, control them, so that they will obey your commands and act up to your wishes.</description>

      <description>THE COSMOS AND THE SELF Everything in nature rises from some fine seed-forms, becomes grosser and grosser, exists for a certain time, and again goes back to the original fine form. Our earth, for instance, has come out of a nebulous form which, becoming colder and colder, turned into this crystallised planet upon which we live, and in the future it will again go to pieces and return to its rudimentary nebulous form.</description>

      <description>WHO IS A REAL GURU? A real Guru is one who is born from time to time as a repository of spiritual force which he transmits to future generations through successive links of Guru and Shishya (disciple). The current of this spirit-force changes its course from time to time, just as a mighty stream of water opens up a new channel and leaves the old one for good. Thus it is seen that old sects of religion grow lifeless in the course of time, and new sects arise with the fire of life in them.</description>

      <description>ON ART The secret of Greek Art is its imitation of nature even to the minutest details; whereas the secret of Indian Art is to represent the ideal. The energy of the Greek painter is spent in perhaps painting a piece of flesh, and he is so successful that a dog is deluded into taking it to be a real bit of meat and so goes to bite it. Now, what glory is there in merely imitating nature?</description>

      <description>ON LANGUAGE Simplicity is the secret. My ideal of language is my Master&amp;rsquo;s language, most colloquial and yet most expressive. It must express the thought which is intended to be conveyed.
The attempt to make the Bengali language perfect in so short a time will make it cut and dried. Properly speaking, it has no verbs. Michael Madhusudan Dutt attempted to remedy this in poetry. The greatest poet in Bengal was Kavikankana.</description>

      <description>THE SANNYASIN In explanation of the term Sannyāsin, the Swami in the course of one of his lectures in Boston said:
When a man has fulfilled the duties and obligations of that stage of life in which he is born, and his aspirations lead him to seek a spiritual life and to abandon altogether the worldly pursuits of possession, fame, or power, when, by the growth of insight into the nature of the world, he sees its impermanence, its strife, its misery, and the paltry nature of its prizes, and turns away from all these — then he seeks the True, the Eternal Love, the Refuge.</description>

 I am reacting only to one of the points raised in Dr. Godbole’s Second Document, namely, the similarity between Christianity, Islam and Marxism as distinguished from true religions.
David Frawley in his book, Hinduism; The Eternal Tradition, says that “the attempt to connect human being with the Eternal is the very essence of true religion”. He further elucidates that true religions base themselves upon something Universal and function harmoniously with the World and Nature.</description>

      <description>THE SANNYASIN AND THE HOUSEHOLDER The men of the world should have no voice in the affairs of the Sannyāsins. The Sannyasin should have nothing to do with the rich, his duty is with the poor. He should treat the poor with loving care and serve them joyfully with all his might. To pay respects to the rich and hang on them for support has been the bane of all the Sannyasin communities of our country.</description>

      <description>ISHVARA AND BRAHMAN In reply to a question as to the exact position of Ishvara in Vedantic Philosophy, the Swami Vivekananda, while in Europe, gave the following definition:
&amp;ldquo;Ishvara is the sum total of individuals, yet He is an Individual, as the human body is a unit, of which each cell is an individual. Samashti or collected equals God; Vyashti or analysed equals the Jiva. The existence of Ishvara, therefore, depends on that of Jiva, as the body on the cell, and vice versa.</description>

      <description>ON JNANA-YOGA All souls are playing, some consciously, some unconsciously. Religion is learning to play consciously.
The same law which holds good in our worldly life also holds good in our religious life and in the life of the cosmos. It is one, it is universal. It is not that religion is guided by one law and the world by another. The flesh and the devil are but degrees of difference from God Himself.</description>

      <description>THE CAUSE OF ILLUSION The question — what is the cause of Māyā (illusion)? — has been asked for the last three thousand years; and the only answer is: when the world is able to formulate a logical question, we shall answer it. The question is contradictory. Our position is that the Absolute has become this relative only apparently, that the Unconditioned has become the conditioned only in Maya. By the very admission of the Unconditioned, we admit that the Absolute cannot be acted upon by anything else.</description>

at afternoon talks with Harvard students on March 22 and 24, 1896. There have also been added notes and selections from unpublished lectures and discourses.)
In the matter of the projection of Akāsha and Prāna into manifested form and the return to fine state, there is a good deal of similarity between Indian thought and modern science.</description>

      <description>BUDDHISM AND VEDANTA The Vedanta philosophy is the foundation of Buddhism and everything else in India; but what we call the Advaita philosophy of the modern school has a great many conclusions of the Buddhists. Of course, the Hindus will not admit that — that is the orthodox Hindus, because to them the Buddhists are heretics. But there is a conscious attempt to stretch out the whole doctrine to include the heretics also.</description>

      <description>ON THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY The Vedantist says that a man is neither born nor dies nor goes to heaven, and that reincarnation is really a myth with regard to the soul. The example is given of a book being turned over. It is the book that evolves, not the man. Every soul is omnipresent, so where can it come or go? These births and deaths are changes in nature which we are mistaking for changes in us.</description>

      <description>LAW AND FREEDOM The struggle never had meaning for the man who is free. But for us it has a meaning, because it is name-and-form that creates the world.
We have a place for struggle in the Vedanta, but not for fear. All fears will vanish when you begin to assert your own nature. If you think that you are bound, bound you will remain. If you think you are free, free you will be.</description>

 I am in receipt of your pamphlet “Time for Stock Taking: A Swayamsevak Speaks” wherein you solicited response to the issues raised therein from Hindus in general and Swayamsevaks in particular.
As I can see, you sent the pamphlet to me for only one reason, that is, myself being one of the participants of the Prajna Bharati Seminar of July’96 at Pune. I see no other reason why you should know my whereabouts.</description>

Sir,
With reference to your Questionnaire under notification No. 318-716-V-Con., dated the 14th April 1954, we enclose herewith our replies.
From the facts narrated you will please note that the activities of the foreign Christian Missionary are very harmful. The Jabalpur Christians in their resolution appearing in the “Amrit Bazar Patrika”, dated the 27th November 1954, desired the Government to wind up your Enquiry also.</description>

      <description>THE GOAL AND METHODS OF REALISATION The greatest misfortune to befall the world would be if all mankind were to recognise and accept but one religion, one universal form of worship, one standard of morality. This would be the death-blow to all religious and spiritual progress. Instead of trying to hasten this disastrous event by inducing persons, through good or evil methods, to conform to our own highest ideal of truth, we ought rather to endeavour to remove all obstacles which prevent men from developing in accordance with their own highest ideals, and thus make their attempt vain to establish one universal religion.</description>

      <description>WORLD-WIDE UNITY Speaking of the world-wide unity, before the Oak Beach Christian Unity, Swami Vivekananda said:
All religions are, at the bottom, alike. This is so, although the Christian Church, like the Pharisee in the parable, thanks God that it alone is right and thinks that all other religions are wrong and in need of Christian light. Christianity must become tolerant before the world will be willing to unite with the Christian Church in a common charity.</description>

      <description>THE AIM OF RAJA-YOGA Yoga has essentially to do with the meditative side of religion, rather than the ethical side, though, of necessity, a little of the latter has to be considered. Men and women are growing to desire more than mere revelation, so called. They want facts in their own consciousness. Only through experience can there be any reality in religion. Spiritual facts are to be gathered mostly from the superconscious state of mind.</description>

      <description>I A DISCUSSION
(This discussion followed the lecture on the Vedanta Philosophy delivered by the Swami at the Graduate Philosophical Society of Harvard University, U. S. A., on March 25, 1896. (Vol. I. ))
Q. — I should like to know something about the present activity of philosophic thought in India. To what extent are these questions discussed?
A. — As I have said, the majority of the Indian people are practically dualists, and the minority are monists.</description>

      <description>II (At the Twentieth Century Club of Boston, U. S. A.)
Q. — Did Vedanta exert any influence over Mohammedanism?
A. — This Vedantic spirit of religious liberality has very much affected Mohammedanism. Mohammedanism in India is quite a different thing from that in any other country. It is only when Mohammedans come from other countries and preach to their co-religionists in India about living with men who are not of their faith that a Mohammedan mob is aroused and fights.</description>

      <description>III (At the Brooklyn Ethical Society, Brooklyn, U. S. A.)
Q. — How can you reconcile your optimistic views with the existence of evil, with the universal prevalence of sorrow and pain?
A. — I can only answer the question if the existence of evil be first proved; but this the Vedantic religion does not admit. Eternal pain unmixed with pleasure would be a positive evil; but temporal pain and sorrow, if they have contributed an element of tenderness and nobility tending towards eternal bliss, are not evils: on the contrary, they may be supreme good.</description>

      <description>IV (Selections from the Math Diary)
(Translated from Bengali )
Q. — Whom can we call a Guru?
A. — He who can tell your past and future is your Guru.
Q. — How can one have Bhakti?
A. — There is Bhakti within you, only a veil of lust-and-wealth covers it, and as soon as that is removed Bhakti will manifest by itself.
Q. — What is the true meaning of the assertion that we should depend on ourselves?</description>

Q. — Does Yoga serve to keep the body in its full health and vitality?
A. — It does. It staves off disease. As objectification of one&amp;rsquo;s own body is difficult, it is very effective in regard to others. Fruit and milk are the best food for Yogis.
Q. — Is the attainment of bliss synchronous with that of Vairagya?
A. — The first step in Vairagya is very painful.</description>

(In answer to a few questions put by Sister Nivedita, Swamiji jotted down the replies on May 24, 1900 at San Francisco.)
Q. — I cannot remember what parts Prithvi Rai and Chānd disguised themselves to play, when they determined to attend the Svayamvara at Kanauj.
A. — Both went as minstrels.
Q. — Also did Prithvi Rai determine to marry Samyuktā partly because she was the daughter of his rival and partly for the fame of her great beauty?</description>

      <description>VII GURU, AVATARA, YOGA, JAPA, SEVA
Q. — How can Vedanta be realised?
A. — By &amp;ldquo;hearing, reflection, and meditation&amp;rdquo;. Hearing must take place from a Sad-guru. Even if one is not a regular disciple, but is a fit aspirant and hears the Sad-guru&amp;rsquo;s words, he is liberated.
Q. — Who is a Sad-guru?
A. — A Sad-guru is one on whom the spiritual power has descended by Guru-paramparā, or an unbroken chain of discipleship.</description>

There existed nothing but cordial relations between the Rajputs and the Maratha till 1743 A.D., but within less than 10 years, the former turned into the most bitter enemies of the latter and conspired with Najib Khan Rohilla and the Durani Chief Ahmad Shah Abdali for their destruction. And even though this enmity turned into a friendship for a temporary period of a few years during 1764 to 1769 A.</description>

 Islam -The Unknown
For years, Mahatma Gandhi made his congregation recite with devotional spirit: “Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram… Ishwar Allah tere naam, Sabko sanmati de Bhagwaan”.
Hindus of all hues were carried away by these chantings, and even after about half a century of his demise, or so to say, bloody partition of the country, this hymn is heard on AIR, DD and through loudspeakers on 2nd October and 31st January from year to year.</description>

1. According to the Census Report the population was as below:- 1931-5,216, 1941-5,552 and 1951-9,006.
These figures are from census report but they are also not correct. The increase in the Christian population is more than indicated in these census.
2. The reason of rise in Christian population is mainly due to conversion and the fall in the population of scheduled tribe and caste is due to this alone.</description>

2. When you think you are a body, are apart from the universe; when you think; you are a soul, you are a spark from the great Eternal Fire; when you think you are the Âtman (Self), you are All.
3. The will is not free — it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect — but there is something behind the will which is free.</description>

      <description>SIX SANSKRIT MOTTOES (Reproduced from Swami Vivekananda in America: New Discoveries. These together with the English translations, were transcribed by Swamiji in six of his photographs.)
1. Ajarāmaravat prājnah vidyām
artham cha chintayet
Grihita iva kesheshu mrityunā
dharmam ācharet
When in search of knowledge or prosperity think that thou would never have death or disease, and when worshipping God think that death&amp;rsquo;s hand is in your hair.
2. Eka eve suhrid dharma</description>

      <description>THE MESSAGE OF DIVINE WISDOM [The following three chapters were discovered among Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s papers. He evidently intended to write a book and jotted down some points for the work.]
I BONDAGE II THE LAW
III THE ABSOLUTE AND THE ATTAINMENT OF FREEDOM
I
BONDAGE
1. Desire is infinite, its fulfilment limited. Desire is unlimited in everyone; the power of fulfilment varies. Thus some are more successful than others in life.</description>

      <description>THE BELUR MATH: AN APPEAL The success which attended the labours of the disciples of Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in diffusing the principles of Hindu religion and obtaining some respect for our much abused faith in the West, gave rise to the hope of training a number of young Sannyāsins to carry on the propaganda, both in and out of India. And an attempt is being made to educate a number of young men according to the Vedic principle of students living in touch with the Guru.</description>

      <description>THE ADVAITA ASHRAMA, HIMALAYAS (These lines were sent in a letter, March, 1899, by Swamiji, for embodying in the prospectus of the Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, Almora, Himalayas.)
In Whom is the Universe, Who is in the Universe, Who is the Universe; in Whom is the Soul, Who is in the Soul, Who is the Soul of Man; knowing Him — and therefore the Universe — as our Self, alone extinguishes all fear, brings an end to misery and leads to Infinite Freedom.</description>

 This is with reference to the pamphlet “Time For Stock Taking: A Swayamsevak Speaks” published by Voice of India. Myself and many others who read it are appalled to learn that R.S.S. leaders have floated a “Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch” which includes, in the definition of panth, religions other than the Sanatan Dharma sects, such as Islam and Christianity, whose fundamentalist and regimented beliefs are diametrically opposed to the spiritual democracy of Hindu Dharma.</description>

      <description>THE RAMAKRISHNA HOME OF SERVICE VARANASI: AN APPEAL (Letter written by Swamiji, to accompany the First Report of the Ramakrishna Home of Service, Varanasi, February, 1902.)
DEAR —
We beg your acceptance of the past year&amp;rsquo;s Report of the Ramakrishna Home of Service, Varanasi, embodying a short statement of our humble efforts towards the amelioration, however little, of the miserable state into which a good many of our fellow-beings, generally old men and women, are cast in this city.</description>

Who knows? Who dares touch
The depths where Mother hides
Her silent failless bolts!
Perchance the child had glimpse
Of shades, behind the scenes,
With eager eyes and strained,
Quivering forms — ready
To jump in front and be
Events, resistless, strong.
Who knows but Mother, how,
And where, and when, they come?
Perchance the shining sage
Saw more than he could tell;</description>

      <description>TO THE FOURTH OF JULY [It is well known that Swami Vivekananda&amp;rsquo;s death (or resurrection, as some of us would prefer to call it!) took place on the 4th of July, 1902. On the 4th of July, 1898, he was travelling with some American disciples in Kashmir, and as part of a domestic conspiracy for the celebration of the day — the anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence — he prepared the following poem, to be read aloud at the early breakfast.</description>

Vast and deep rivers — swelling and impetuous — charming pleasure-gardens by the river banks, putting to shame the celestial Nandana-Kānana; amidst these pleasure-gardens rise, towering to the sky, beautiful marble palaces, decorated with the most exquisite workmanship of fine art; on the sides, in front, and behind, clusters of huts, with crumbling mud-walls and dilapidated roofs, the bamboos of which, forming their skeletons, as it were, are exposed to view; moving about here and there emaciated figures of young and old in tattered rags, whose faces bear deep-cut lines of the despair and poverty of hundreds of years; cows, bullocks, buffaloes everywhere — ay, the same melancholy look in their eyes, the same feeble physique; on the wayside refuse and dirt: This is our present-day India!</description>

      <description>THE METHODS AND PURPOSE OF RELIGION In studying the religions of the world we generally find two methods of procedure. The one is from God to man. That is to say, we have the Semitic group of religions in which the idea of God comes almost from the very first, and, strangely enough, without any idea of soul. It was very remarkable amongst the ancient Hebrews that, until very recent periods in their history, they never evolved any idea of a human soul.</description>

      <description>THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND ITS GOAL The earliest idea is that a man, when he dies, is not annihilated. Something lives and goes on living even after the man is dead. Perhaps it would be better to compare the three most ancient nations — the Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the ancient Hindus — and take this idea from all of them. With the Egyptians and the Babylonians, we find a sort of soul idea — that of a double.</description>

      <description>THE IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY The idea of psychology in the West is very much degraded. Psychology is the science of sciences; but in the West it is placed upon the same plane as all other sciences; that is, it is judged by the same criterion — utility.
How much practical benefit will it do to humanity? How much will it add to our rapidly growing happiness? How much will it detract from our rapidly increasing pain?</description>

      <description>NATURE AND MAN The modern idea of nature includes only that part of the universe that is manifested on the physical plane. That which is generally understood to be mind is not considered to be nature.
Philosophers endeavouring to prove the freedom of the will have excluded the mind from nature; for as nature is bound and governed by law, strict unbending law, mind, if considered to be in nature, would be bound by law also.</description>

      <description>CONCENTRATION AND BREATHING The main difference between men and the animals is the difference in their power of concentration. All success in any line of work is the result of this. Everybody knows something about concentration. We see its results every day. High achievements in art, music, etc., are the results of concentration. An animal has very little power of concentration. Those who have trained animals find much difficulty in the fact that the animal is constantly forgetting what is told him.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION TO JNANA-YOGA This is the rational and philosophic side of Yoga and very difficult, but I will take you slowly through it.
Yoga means the method of joining man and God. When you understand this, you can go on with your own definitions of man and God, and you will find the term Yoga fits in with every definition. Remember always, there are different Yogas for different minds, and that if one does not suit you, another may.</description>

There is difference between love and infatuation. Infatuation can be one-sided but love is reciprocal. Devotion is blind. Quite a few Hindus appear infatuated with Muslims.</description>

      <description>THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY AND CHRISTIANITY (Notes of a lecture delivered at the Unitarian Church, in Oakland, California, on February 28, 1900)
Between all great religions of the world there are many points of similarity; and so startling is this likeness, at times, as to suggest the idea that in many particulars the different religions have copied from one another.
This act of imitation has been laid at the door of different religions; but that it is a superficial charge is evident from the following facts:</description>

We have been taking up the more analytical side of human nature. In this course we [shall] study the emotional side. . . . The former deals with man as unlimited being, [as] principle, the latter with man as limited being. . . .

All of you who are students of the Bible . . . .understand that the whole [of] Jewish history and Jewish thought have been produced by two [types of] teachers — priests and prophets, the priests representing the power of conservatism, the prophets the power of progress.

[Love may be symbolised by a triangle. The first angle is,] love questions not. It is not a beggar. . . . Beggar&amp;rsquo;s love is no love at all. The first sign of love is when love asks nothing, [when it] gives everything. This is the real spiritual worship, the worship through love.</description>

      <description>RELIGION AND SCIENCE Experience is the only source of knowledge. In the world, religion is the only science where there is no surety, because it is not taught as a science of experience. This should not be. There is always, however, a small group of men who teach religion from experience. They are called mystics, and these mystics in every religion speak the same tongue and teach the same truth. This is the real science of religion.</description>

      <description>RELIGION IS REALISATION The greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of realisation; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books and forms and let your soul see its Self. &amp;ldquo;We are deluded and maddened by books&amp;rdquo;, Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The moment you think creed and form and ceremony the &amp;ldquo;be-all&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end-all&amp;rdquo;, then you are in bondage.</description>

      <description>RELIGION IS SELF-ABNEGATION One cannot divide the rights of the universe. To talk of &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; implies limitation. It is not &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;responsibility&amp;rdquo;. Each is responsible for the evil anywhere in the world. No one can separate himself from his brother. All that unites with the universal is virtue; all that separates is sin. You are a part of the Infinite. This is your nature. Hence you are your brother&amp;rsquo;s keeper.</description>

      <description>UNSELFISH WORK IS TRUE RENUNCIATION This world is not for cowards. Do not try to fly. Look not for success or failure. Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on. Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something behind the work.</description>

      <description>FREEDOM OF THE SELF As we cannot know except through effects that we have eyes, so we cannot see the Self except by Its effects. It cannot be brought down to the low plane of sense-perception. It is the condition of everything in the universe, though Itself unconditioned. When we know that we are the Self, then we are free. The Self can never change. It cannot be acted on by a cause, because It is Itself the cause.</description>

      <description>NOTES ON VEDANTA The cardinal features of the Hindu religion are founded on the meditative and speculative philosophy and on the ethical teachings contained in the various books of the Vedas, which assert that the universe is infinite in space and eternal in duration. It never had a beginning and it never will have an end. Innumerable have been the manifestations of the power of the Spirit in the realm of matter, of the force or the Infinite in the domain of the finite, but the Infinite Itself is self-existent, eternal, and unchangeable.</description>

      <description>40. Vikram Singh
 Dr. Shreerang Godbole, a Swayamsewak of the RSS for 17 years, put forth his views frankly and plainly on “Hindu Organisations and the Muslim Problem” at a Seminar in the presence of the think-tanks of the Sangh Parivar. Immediately after that, he wrote a letter to Shri K.S. Sudarshan, Sah-Karyawaha R.S.S., bemoaning the formation of the “Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch” by the Sangh.
Thanks to Voice of India both the documents are now available to the interested persons.</description>

      <description>HINDU AND GREEK Three mountains stand as typical of progress — the Himalayas of Indo-Aryan, Sinai of Hebrew, and Olympus of Greek civilisation. When the Aryans reached India, they found the climate so hot that they would not work incessantly, so they began to think; thus they became introspective and developed religion. They discovered that there was no limit to the power of mind; they therefore sought to master that; and through it they learnt that there was something infinite coiled up in the frame we call man, which was seeking to become kinetic.</description>

      <description>THOUGHTS ON THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS The Vedic sacrificial altar was the origin of Geometry.
The invocation of the Devas, or bright ones, was the basis of worship. The idea is that one invoked is helped and helps.
Hymns are not only words of praise but words of power, being pronounced with the right attitude of mind.
Heavens are only other states of existence with added senses and heightened powers.</description>

      <description>ON RAJA-YOGA The first stage of Yoga is Yama.
To master Yama five things are necessary:
(1) Non-injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.
(2) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed
(3) Non-covetousness in thought, word, and deed.
(4) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.
(5) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.
Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it.
Then come Âsana, or posture, of a devotee.</description>

      <description>ON BHAKTI-YOGA Bhakti-Yoga is the path of systematised devotion for the attainment of union with the Absolute. It is the easiest and surest path to religion or realisation.
Love to God is the one essential to be perfect in this path.
There are five stages of love.
First, man wants help and has a little fear.
Second, when God is seen as Father.
Third, when God is seen as Mother. Then all women are looked upon as reflections of the Mother-God.</description>

      <description>ON JNANA-YOGA First, meditation should be of a negative nature. Think away everything. Analyse everything that comes in the mind by the sheer action of the will.
Next, assert what we really are — existence, knowledge and bliss — being, knowing, and loving.
Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object. Meditate:
Above, it is full of me; below, it is full of me; in the middle, it is full of me.</description>

      <description>THE REALITY AND SHADOW That which differentiates one thing from another is time, space, and causation.
The differentiation is in the form, not in the substance.
You may destroy the form and it disappears for ever; but the substance remains the same. You can never destroy the substance.
Evolution is in nature, not in the soul — evolution of nature, manifestation of the soul.
Maya is not illusion as it is popularly interpreted.</description>

      <description>HOW TO BECOME FREE All things in nature work according to law. Nothing is excepted. The mind as well as everything in external nature is governed and controlled by law.
Internal and external nature, mind and matter, are in time and space, and are bound by the law of causation.
The freedom of the mind is a delusion. How can the mind be free when it is controlled and bound by law?</description>

      <description>SOUL AND GOD Anything that is in space has form. Space itself has form. Either you are in space, or space is in you. The soul is beyond all space. Space is in the soul, not the soul in space.
Form is confined to time and space and is bound by the law of causation. All time is in us, we are not in time. As the soul is not in time and space, all time and space are within the soul.</description>

      <description>THE GOAL Dualism recognises God and nature to be eternally separate: the universe and nature eternally dependent upon God.
The extreme monists make no such distinction. In the last analysis, they claim, all is God: the universe becomes lost in God; God is the eternal life of the universe.
With them infinite and finite are mere terms. The universe, nature, etc. exist by virtue of differentiation. Nature is itself differentiation.</description>

      <description>ON PROOF OF RELIGION The great question about religion is: What makes it so unscientific? If religion is a science, why is it not as certain as other sciences? All beliefs in God, heaven, etc., are mere conjectures, mere beliefs. There seems to be nothing certain about it. Our ideas concerning religion are changing all the time. The mind is in a constant state of flux.
Is man a soul, an unchanging substance, or is he a constantly changing quantity?</description>

      <description>41. Dr. Vinay Kumar Sinha
 I quite agree with what Dr. Godbole has opined about Islam and Christianity and the concept of Secularism or Sarvadharma Sambhãv or Sarva Panth Samãdar etc.
Yes, it is utterly wrong to bracket Hinduism (and its offshoots like Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism) with such exclusivist ideologies as Islam and Christianity. It is in fact wrong to regard Christianity and Islam as Dharmas. Let us discuss why.</description>

      <description>THE DESIGN THEORY The idea that nature in all her orderly arrangements shows design on the part of the Creator of the universe is good as a kindergarten teaching to show the beauty, power, and glory of God, in order to lead children in religion up to a philosophical conception of God; but apart from that, it is not good, and perfectly illogical. As a philosophical idea, it is entirely without foundation, if God is taken to be omnipotent.</description>

      <description>SPIRIT AND NATURE Religion is the realisation of Spirit as Spirit; not Spirit as matter.
Religion is a growth. Each one must experience it himself. The Christians believe that Jesus Christ died to save man. With you it is belief in a doctrine, and this belief constitutes your salvation. With us doctrine has nothing whatever to do with salvation. Each one may believe in whatever doctrine he likes; or in no doctrine.</description>

      <description>THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION (At Alameda, Calif., March 18, 1900)
We read many books, but that does not bring us knowledge. We may read all the Bibles in the world, but that will not give us religion. Theoretical religion is easy enough to get, any one may get that. What we want is practical religion.
The Christian idea of a practical religion is in doing good works — worldly utility.</description>

      <description>NOTES TAKEN DOWN IN MADRAS, 1892-93 The three essentials of Hinduism are belief in God, in the Vedas as revelation, in the doctrine of Karma and transmigration.
If one studies the Vedas between the lines, one sees a religion of harmony.
One point of difference between Hinduism and other religions is that in Hinduism we pass from truth to truth — from a lower truth to a higher truth — and never from error to truth.</description>

      <description>CONCENTRATION Concentration is the essence of all knowledge, nothing can be done without it. Ninety per cent of thought force is wasted by the ordinary human being, and therefore he is constantly committing blunders; the trained man or mind never makes a mistake. When the mind is concentrated and turned backward on itself, all within us will be our servants, not our masters. The Greeks applied their concentration to the external world, and the result was perfection in art, literature, etc.</description>

      <description>THE POWER OF THE MIND The cause becomes the effect. The cause is not one thing and the effect something else that exists as a result. The effect is always the cause worked out. Always, the cause becomes the effect. The popular idea is that the effect is the result of the operation of a cause which is something independent and aloof from the effect. al his is not so. The effect is always the cause worked out into another condition.</description>

PRANA
The theory of creation is that matter is subject to five conditions: ether, luminous ether, gaseous, liquid, and solid. They are all evoked out of one primal element, which is very finest ether.
The name of the energy in the universe is Prāna, which is the force residing in these elements.</description>

      <description>LESSONS ON BHAKTI-YOGA THE YOGA THROUGH DEVOTION
We have been considering Raja-Yoga and the physical exercises. Now we shall consider Yoga through devotion. But you must remember that no one system is necessary (for all). I want to set before you many systems, many ideals, in order that you may find one that will suit you; if one does not, perhaps another may.
We want to become harmonious beings, with the psychical, spiritual, intellectual, and working (active) sides of our nature equally developed.</description>

      <description>MOTHER-WORSHIP (Based on fragmentary notes of a class talk by Swami Vivekananda in New York.)
The two conjoint facts of perception we can never get rid of are happiness and unhappiness — things which bring us pain also bring pleasure. Our world is made up of these two. We cannot get rid of them; with every pulsation of life they are present. The world is busy trying to reconcile these opposites, sages trying to find solution of this commingling of the opposites.</description>

 Dr. Godbole’s views are stated so succinctly, so concisely and so comprehensively that there is really little need for any comments on them: it is for the Sangh leadership to read his views very carefully and repeatedly, and to seriously ponder over the matter.
However, I would like, nevertheless, to make the following elaborations of my views on the following points raised by Dr. Godbole as well as by Voice of India in their comments on his views:</description>

CHAPTER I
1. Bhakti is intense love for God.
2. It is the nectar of love;
3. Getting which man becomes perfect, immortal, and satisfied for ever;
4. Getting which man desires no more, does not become jealous of anything, does not take pleasure in vanities:
5. Knowing which man becomes filled with spirituality, becomes calm, and finds pleasure only in God.</description>

नासतः सत् जायते — Existence cannot be produced by non-existence.
Non-existence can never be the cause of what exists. Something cannot come out of nothing. That the law of causation is omnipotent and knows no time or place when it did not exist is a doctrine as old as the Aryan race, sung by its ancient poet-seers, formulated by its philosophers, and made the corner-stone upon which the Hindu man even of today builds his whole scheme of life.</description>

Ever rising, ever falling with the waves of time,
still rolling on I go
From fleeting scene to scene ephemeral,
with life&amp;rsquo;s currents&#39; ebb and flow.
Oh! I am sick of this unending force;
these shows they please no more.
This ever running, never reaching,
nor e&amp;rsquo;en a distant glimpse of shore!
From life to life I&amp;rsquo;m waiting at the gates,</description>

No ancient soul could dream before —
Be thou to India&amp;rsquo;s future son
The mistress, servant, friend in one.</description>

      <description>THE HYMN OF CREATION (A translation of the Nāsadiya-Sukta, Rig-Veda, X. 129.)
Existence was not then, nor non-existence,
The world was not, the sky beyond was neither.
What covered the mist? Of whom was that?
What was in the depths of darkness thick?
Death was not then, nor immortality,
The night was neither separate from day,
But motionless did That vibrate
Alone, with Its own glory one —
Beyond That nothing did exist.</description>

White, black, of snaky shades and thicknesses;
An orange sun, about to say farewell,
Touches the massed cloud-shapes with streaks of red.
The wind blows as it lists, a hurricane</description>

      <description>HINDUISM AND SHRI RAMAKRISHNA (Translated from Bengali )
By the word &amp;ldquo;Shastras&amp;rdquo; the Vedas without beginning or end are meant. In matters of religious duty the Vedas are the only capable authority.
The Puranas and other religious scriptures are all denoted by the word &amp;ldquo;Smriti&amp;rdquo;. And their authority goes so far as they follow the Vedas and do not contradict them.
Truth is of two kinds: (1) that which is cognisable by the five ordinary senses of man, and by reasonings based thereon; (2) that which is cognisable by the subtle, supersensuous power of Yoga.</description>

      <description>THE BENGALI LANGUAGE (Translated from Bengali )
(Written for the &amp;ldquo;Udbodhan&amp;quot;)
In our country, owing to all learning being in Sanskrit from the ancient times, there has arisen an immeasurable gulf between the learned and the common folk. All the great personages, from Buddha down to Chaitanya and Ramakrishna, who came for the well-being of the world, taught the common people in the language of the people themselves. Of course, scholarship is an excellent thing; but cannot scholarship be displayed through any other medium than a language that is stiff and unintelligible, that is unnatural and merely artificial?</description>

 First Document
We Hindus find it deeply distressing that quite a few Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders of national stature have taken to propagating among the Hindu public certain proposition to propitiate the Muslims. These propositions, besides being false and misleading, are highly dangerous to Hindu society as they implant Negationism - the denial of the centuries-long Muslim havoc in India - in the Hindu mind.</description>

I confirm the statement which I have filed in reply to the questionnaire.

A man presented himself to be blessed by a sight of the Deity. He had an access of joy and devotion at the sight; and perhaps to pay back the good he received, he burst out into a song. In one corner of the hall, reclining against a pillar, was Chobeji dozing. He was the priest in the temple, an athlete, a player on the guitar, was a good hand in swallowing two jugfuls of Bhāng (an intoxicating drink.</description>

VRINDABAN,
12th Aug., 1888.
DEAR SIR,
Leaving Ayodhya I have reached the holy Vrindaban, and am putting up at Kālā Bābu&amp;rsquo;s Kunja. In the town the mind feels contracted. Places like Rādhā-kunda, I have heard, are delightful; but they are at some distance from the town. I have a mind to proceed very shortly to Hardwar. In case you have any acquaintance there, you would be doing me a great favour if you would kindly write him an introduction for me.</description>

VRINDABAN,
20th Aug., 1888.
DEAR SIR,
An aged brother-disciple of mine who has just come back to Vrindaban after visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath met Gangadhar. Twice did Gangadhar ascend up to Tibet and Bhutan. He is in great happiness and felt overwhelmed and wept at the meeting. He spent the winter at Kankhal. The Karoā (waterpot) you gave him, he still keeps with him. He is coming back and is expected at Vrindaban this very month.</description>

RESPECTED SIR,
I have received the two books sent by you and am filled with joy to read your wonderfully affectionate letter which betokens your broad, generous heart. No doubt, it is due to good merit of my previous births that you show, sir, so much kindness to a mendicant like me who lives on begging.</description>

BARANAGORE,
4th Feb., 1889.
DEAR SIR,
For some reason I had been feeling today agitated and cramped in my mind, when your letter of invitation to the heavenly city of Varanasi reached me. I accept it as the call of Vishveshvara. (The Lord of the Universe, or Shiva, as installed in the leading temple of Varanasi or Kashi.) I am going now on a pilgrimage to the place of my Master&amp;rsquo;s nativity, and after a sojourn of a few days there, I shall present myself to you.</description>

DEAR M—,
Thanks a hundred thousand times, Master! You have hit Ramakrishna in the right point.
Few, alas, few understand him!
Yours,
VIVEKANANDA.
PS. My heart leaps with joy — and it is a wonder that I do not go mad when I find anybody thoroughly launched into the midst of the doctrine which is to shower peace on earth hereafter.

DEAR SIR,
For sundry reasons I have been unable to write to you for long, for which please excuse me. I have now obtained news of Gangadhar. He met one of my brother -disciples, and both are now staying in the Uttarakhanda (the sacred Himalayas). Four of us from here are in the Himalayas now, and with Gangadhar they are five.</description>

DEAR SIR,
It pleased me highly to know all the news in your letter yesterday. You have asked me to request Gangadhar to write to you, but I see no chance thereof, for though they are sending us letters, they do not stop anywhere for more than two or three days and therefore do not receive any of ours.</description>

DEAR SIR,
It is more than a week since I received your letter, but having had another attack of fever, I could not send a reply all this time, for which please excuse me. For an interval of a month and a half I kept well, but I have suffered again for the last ten days; now I am doing well.</description>

 I am highly grateful to you for sending to me the views of Dr. Godbole on the recent efforts of some Hindu organisations at bringing Muslims into Indian mainstream by preaching equal respect for every religion. But the exercise is futile and will only weaken the structure of the nation.
Instead, we must give serious thought to the ailments which are bedevilling the nation. Why even after so much accommodation of almost every demand, reasonable or unreasonable, Muslims make a show of disaffection and dissatisfaction?</description>

The problem of Pakistan has given a headache to everyone, more so to me than to anybody else. I cannot help recalling with regret how much of my time it has consumed when so much of my other literary work of greater importance to me than this is held up for want of it. I therefore hope that this second edition will also be the last.</description>

BARANAGORE,
17th Aug., 1889.
DEAR SIR,
You have expressed embarrassment in your last favour for being addressed reverentially. But the blame attaches not to me but to your own excellent qualities. I wrote in one letter before that from the way I feel attracted by your lofty virtues, it seems we had some affinity from previous births. I make no distinction as to householder or Sannyasin in this, that for all time my head shall bend low in reverence wherever I see greatness, broadness of heart, and holiness — Shāntih!</description>

DEAR SIR,
Some days ago I received your two kind letters. I am very much pleased to find in you a wonderful harmony of Jnana and Bhakti. Your advice to me to give up arguing and disputing is very true indeed, and that is really the goal of life for the individual — &amp;ldquo;Sundered are the knots of the heart, torn off are all his doubts, and the seeds of his Karma wear off, when the sight of the Transcendent One is gained.</description>

DEAR SIR,
I have all particulars from your letter; and from Rakhal&amp;rsquo;s which followed, I came to know of your meeting. I have received the pamphlet written by you. A kind of scientific Advaitism has been spreading in Europe ever since the theory of the conservation of energy was discovered, but all that is Parināmavāda, evolution by real modification. It is good you have shown the difference between this and Shankara&amp;rsquo;s Vivartavāda (progressive manifestation by unreal superimposition).</description>

It is so very difficult to meet the Babaji. He does not step out of his home; and, when willing to speak at all, he just comes near the door to speak from inside.

A great sage indeed! — It is all very wonderful, and in this atheistic age, a towering representation of marvellous power born of Bhakti and Yoga! I have sought refuge in his grace; and he has given me hope — a thing very few may be fortunate enough to obtain.</description>

 PROLOGUE
It can rightly be said that the long introduction with which this treatise opens leaves no excuse for a prologue. But there is an epilogue which is affixed to the treatise. Having done that, I thought of prefixing a prologue, firstly, because an epilogue needs to be balanced by a prologue, and secondly, because the prologue gives me room to state in a few words the origin of this treatise to those who may be curious to know it and to impress upon the readers the importance of the issues raised in it.</description>

DEAR SIR,
I feel very happy to hear from you just now. Apparently in his features, the Babaji is a Vaishnava the embodiment, so to speak, of Yoga, Bhakti, and humility. His dwelling has walls on all sides with a few doors in them. Inside these walls, there is one long underground burrow wherein he lays himself up in Samādhi. He talks to others only when he comes out of the hole.</description>

DEAR SIR,
I wrote a letter to brother Gangadhar asking him to stop his wandering and settle down somewhere and to send me an account of the various Sadhus he had come across in Tibet and their ways and customs. I enclose the reply that came from him. Brother Kali is having repeated attacks of fever at Hrishikesh.</description>

DEAR SIR,
The lumbago is giving a good deal of trouble, or else I would have already sought to come to you. The mind does not find rest here any longer. It is three days since I came away from Babaji&amp;rsquo;s place, but he inquires of me kindly almost every day. As soon as the lumbago is a little better, I bid good-bye to Babaji.</description>

DEAR SIR,
Your kind letter comes to hand just now. You know not, sir, I am a very soft-natured man in spite of the stern Vedantic views I hold. And this proves to be my undoing. At the slightest touch I give myself away; for howsoever I may try to think only of my own good, I slip off in spite of myself to think of other peoples&#39; interests.</description>

BELOVED AKHANDANANDA,
Very glad to receive your letter yesterday. I am at present staying with the wonderful Yogi and devotee of this place, called Pavhariji. He never comes out of his room and holds conversations with people from behind the door. Inside the room there is a pit in which he lives. It is rumoured that he remains in a state of Samadhi for months together.</description>

BELOVED AKHANDANANDA,
Received another letter of yours just now, and with great difficulty deciphered the scribblings. I have written everything in detail in my last letter. You start immediately on receipt of this. I know the route to Tibet via Nepal that you have spoken of. As they don&amp;rsquo;t allow anyone to enter Tibet easily, so they don&amp;rsquo;t allow anybody to go anywhere in Nepal, except Katmandu, its capital, and one or two places of pilgrimage.</description>

 It was indeed very nice of you to give me an opportunity to express my views on the important points raised by Dr. Godbole of Pune.
Alas! every word of Dr. Godbole is true. This truth has been brought out clearly in many documented publications on Christianity and Islam.
“Sarva Dharma Samabãhva”
People, who think on these lines commit the blunder of believing that Islam is only Namaz, Roza, Zakat and Hajj which are of course common to all religions in one form or the other.</description>

 INTRODUCTION
The Muslim League&amp;rsquo;s Resolution on Pakistan has called forth different reactions. There are some who look upon it as a case of political measles to which a people in the infancy of their conscious unity and power are very liable. Others have taken it as a permanent frame of the Muslim mind and not merely a passing phase and have in consequence been greatly perturbed.</description>

DEAR SIR,
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been here for the last few days and am again going away today. I have asked brother Gangadhar to come here; and if he comes, we go over to you together. For some special reasons, I shall continue to stay in secret in a village some distance from this place, and there&amp;rsquo;s no facility for writing any letter from that place, owing to which I could not reply to your letter so long.</description>

MY DEAR KALI (ABHEDANANDA),
Glad to receive your letter as well as Pramada Babu&amp;rsquo;s and Baburam&amp;rsquo;s (Premananda&amp;rsquo;s). I am doing pretty well here. You have expressed a desire to see me. I too have a similar longing, and it is this that makes me afraid of going. Moreover, the Babaji forbids me to do so. I shall try to go on a few days&#39; leave from him.</description>

 I. Dipen Banerjee
At first I must thank you, for sending such a valuable document written by Dr. Shreerang Godbole to a man like me of no importance.
Now I like to say something as a Hindu in general. Though I am not a Swayamsevak, I am closely related with the R.S.S. So I feel sad when I see that even a Nationalistic organisation like B.M.S. fails to understand the basic ideologies of the monotheistic traditions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism, and harps on the much vaunted theory of Sarva Pantha Samãdar.</description>

WHAT DOES THE LEAGUE DEMAND?
I
[The Muslim League&amp;rsquo;s Resolution of March 1940]
On the 26th of March 1940, Hindu India was startled to attention as it had never been before. On that day, the Muslim League at its Lahore Session passed the following Resolution :—
 &amp;ldquo;1. While approving and endorsing the action taken by the Council and the Working Committee of the All-India Muslim League as indicated in their resolutions dated the 27th of August, 17th and 18th of September and 22nd of October 1939 and 3rd of February 1940 on the constitutional issue, this Session of the All-India Muslim League emphatically reiterates that the Scheme of Federation embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, is totally unsuited to, and unworkable in the peculiar conditions of this country and is altogether unacceptable to Muslim India;</description>

AMERICA,
1894.
. . . &amp;ldquo;It is not the building that makes the home, but it is the wife that makes it,&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;न गृहं गृहमित्याहुर्गृहिणी गृहमुच्यते ।&amp;quot;) says a Sanskrit poet, and how true it is! The roof that affords you shelter from heat and cold and rain is not to be judged by the pillars that support it — the finest Corinthian columns though they be — but by the real spirit-pillar who is the centre, the real support of the home — the woman.</description>

MY DEAR SHASHI (RAMAKRISHNANANDA),
I have not written to you since coming to this country. But Haridas Bhai&amp;rsquo;s1 letter gives me all the news. It is excellent that G. C. Ghosh2 and all of you have treated him with due consideration.
I have no wants in this country, but mendicancy has no vogue here, and I have to labour, that is, lecture in places.</description>

DEAR SIR, (Rao Bahadur Narasimhachariar.)
Your kindness to me makes me venture to take a little advantage of it. Mrs. Potter Palmer is the chief lady of the United States. She was the lady president of the World&amp;rsquo;s Fair. She is much interested in raising the women of the world and is at the head of a big organisation for women. She is a particular friend of Lady Dufferin and has been entertained by the Royalties of Europe on account of her wealth and position.</description>

Salutations to Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna!

DEAR BROTHERS, (Brother-disciples of Swamiji.)
Before this I wrote to you a letter which for want of time was very incomplete. Rakhal (Brahmananda) and Hari (Turiyananda) wrote in a letter from Lucknow that Hindu newspapers were praising me, and that they were very glad that twenty thousand people had partaken of food at Shri Ramakrishna&amp;rsquo;s anniversary. I could do much more work but for the Brahmos and missionaries who have been opposing me unceasingly, and the Hindus of India too did nothing for me.</description>

 A common tenet of Hinduism is “Sarva Dharma Samabhãva,” which literally means that all Dharmas are equal to or harmonious with each other. In recent times this statement has been highlighted as meaning that “all religions are the same” - that all religions are merely different paths to God or the same spiritual goal. Based on this logic the religious path that one takes is a matter of personal preference, like choosing whether to eat rice or chapatis in order to fill one’s stomach.</description>

 CHAPTER II
A NATION CALLING FOR A HOME
That there are factors, administrative, linguistic or cultural, which are the predisposing causes behind these demands for separation, is a fact which is admitted and understood by all. Nobody minds these demands and many are prepared to concede them. But, the Hindus say that the Muslims are going beyond the idea of separation and questions, such as what has led them to take this course, why are they asking for partition, for the annulment of the common tie by a legal divorce between Pakistan and Hindustan, are being raised.</description>

Many thanks for your kindness in sending me the introduction to Mr. Frederic Douglas. You need not be sorry on account of the ill-treatment I received at the hands of a low class hotel-keeper at Baltimore. It was the fault of the Vrooman brothers. Why should they take me to a low hotel?

Your two letters are to hand, as also the two of Ramdayal Babu. I have got the bill of lading; but it will be long before the goods arrive.

The litigants of Salhedanda village of Mandla tahsil by name Luta and Hazari were coerced by one Padri byname Anthony Thudiyhill (Roman Catholic) to effect a compromise of their case on pain of dire consequences.</description>

DEAR SANYAL,
. . Paramahamsa Deva was my Guru, and whatever I may think of him in point of greatness, why should the world think like me? And if you press the point hard, you will spoil everything. The idea of worshipping the Guru as God is nowhere to be met with outside Bengal, for other people are not yet ready to take up that ideal.</description>

Accept my heartfelt gratitude for your motherly advice. I hope I will be able to carry out them in life.
How can I express my gratitude to you for what you have already done for me and my work, and my eternal gratitude to you for your offering to do something more this year. But I sincerely believe that you ought to turn all your help to Miss Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Greenacre work this year.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
I am astonished to hear the scandals the Ramabai circles are indulging in about me. Don&amp;rsquo;t you see, Mrs. Bull, that however a man may conduct himself, there will always be persons who invent the blackest lies about him? At Chicago I had such things every day against me.

MY DEAR SHASHI,
. . . You write that you have recovered from your illness; but you must henceforth be very careful. Late dinners or unwholesome food, or living in a stinking place may bring on a relapse, and make it hard to escape the clutches of malaria. First of all you should hire a small garden-house — you may get one for thirty or forty rupees.</description>

HINDU CASE AGAINST PAKISTAN

CHAPTER IV
BREAK-UP OF UNITY
Before the Hindus complain of the destruction of the unity of India, let them make certain that the unity they are harping upon does exist. What unity is there between Pakistan and Hindustan?
Those Hindus, who maintain the affirmative, rely chiefly upon the fact that the areas which the Muslims want to be separated from India have always been a part of India.</description>

DEAR SHASHI,
. . . I am quite in agreement with what Sarada is doing, but it is not necessary to preach that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was an Incarnation, and things of that sort. He came to do good to the world; not to trumpet his own name — you must always remember this. Disciples pay their whole attention to the preservation of their master&amp;rsquo;s name and throw overboard his teachings; and sectarianism etc.</description>

HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING, ENGLAND,
17th Sept., 1895.
DEAR MRS. BULL,
Mr. Sturdy and I want to get hold of a few of the best, say, strong and intelligent men in England to form a society, and therefore we must proceed slowly. We must take care not to be run over with &amp;ldquo;fads&amp;rdquo; from the first. This you will know has been my policy in America too.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
I have not done any visible work as yet except helping Mr. Sturdy in studying Sanskrit. &amp;hellip; Mr. Sturdy wants me to bring over a monk from India from amongst my brethren to help him when I am away in America. I have written to India for one. . . . So far it is all right. I am waiting for the next wave.</description>

DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. F. H. Leggett)
You have not forgotten your son? Where are you now? And Tante and the babies? What about our saintly worshipper at your shrine? Joe Joe is not entering &amp;ldquo;Nirvana&amp;rdquo; so soon, but her deep silence almost seems to be a big &amp;ldquo;Samadhi&amp;rdquo;.
Are you on the move? I am enjoying England very much.</description>

MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA,
I am very glad to receive your letter. It is excellent work that you are doing. R— is very liberal and openhanded, but no advantage should be taken over him for that reason. About the raising of funds by Shrimān —, well, it is a fair enterprise; but my boy, this is a very queer world, where even the World-Gods Brahmā and Vishnu find it difficult to evade the clutches of lust and gold.</description>

Many thanks for your kind note of welcome. I arrived last Friday after ten days of a very tedious voyage. It was awfully rough and for the first time in my life I was very badly seasick. . . .

G.A. Wells
 Why I Am Not a Muslim, By Ibn Warraq (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1995) 402 pp., $25.95 cloth.
Why I Am Not a Muslim certainly deserves the epithet “courageous” with which R. J. Hoffmann introduces it in his Foreword, not so much because of its thesis that Islamic civilization often reached magnificent heights despite the religion of Islam, as because almost all the fundamental tents of Islam are here scrutinized uncompromisingly.</description>

 CHAPTER VI
PAKISTAN AND COMMUNAL PEACE
Does Pakistan solve the Communal Question, is a natural question which every Hindu is sure to ask. A correct answer to this question calls for a close analysis of what is involved in it.One must have a clear idea as to what is exactly meant, when the Hindus and Muslims speak of the Communal Question. Without it, it will not be possible to say whether Pakistan does or does not solve the Communal Question.</description>

DEAR SISTER, (Miss S. Farmer)
In this universe where nothing is lost, where we live in the midst of death in life, every thought that is thought, in public or in private, in crowded thoroughfares or in the deep recesses of primeval forests, lives. They are continuously trying to become self-embodied, and until they have embodied themselves, they will struggle for expression, and any amount of repression cannot kill them.</description>

DEAR SARADA,
. . .Your idea of the paper is very good indeed. Apply yourself to it heart and soul. . . . Never mind the funds. . . . There are many to preach Christianity and Mohammedanism — you just go through the preaching of your own country&amp;rsquo;s religion. But then if you can get hold of a Mohammedan who is versed in Arabic and have old Arabic books translated, it will be a good plan.</description>

. . . Day before yesterday I had a fine visit with Prof. Max Müller. He is a saintly man and looks like a young man in spite of his seventy years, and his face is without a wrinkle. I wish I had half his love for India and Vedanta. At the same time he is a friend of Yoga too and believes in it.</description>

HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN
I
[Lala Hardayal&amp;rsquo;s scheme for conversion in the North-West]
Thinking of the Hindu alternative to Pakistan, the scheme that at once comes to one&amp;rsquo;s mind is the one put forth by the late Lala Hardayal in 1925. It was published in the form of a statement which appeared in the Pratap of Lahore.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
The Raja-Yoga book is going on splendidly. Saradananda goes to the States soon.
I do not like any one whom I love to become a lawyer, although my father was one. My Master was against it, and I believe that that family is sure to come to grief where there are several lawyers. Our country is full of them; the universities turn them out by the hundreds.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
The English people are very generous. In three minutes&#39; time the other evening, my class raised £150 for the new quarters for next autumn&amp;rsquo;s work. They would have given £500 on the spot if wanted, but we want to go slow, and not rush into expense. There will be many hands here to carry on the work, and they understand a bit of renunciation, here — the deep English character.</description>

MY DEAR SHASHI,
Today I received a letter from Ramdayal Babu, in which he writes that many public women attend the Ramakrishna anniversary festival at Dakshineswar, which makes many less inclined to go there. Moreover, in his opinion one day should be appointed for men and another for women. My decision on the point is this:
1. If public women are not allowed to go to such a great place of pilgrimage as Dakshineswar, where else shall they go to?</description>

Your very welcome news reached me just now, on my return here from Switzerland. I am very, very happy to learn that at last you have thought it better to change your mind about the felicity of &amp;ldquo;Old Maids Home&amp;rdquo;. You are perfectly right now — marriage is the truest goal for ninety-nine per cent of the human race, and they will live the happiest life as soon as they have learnt and are ready to abide by the eternal lesson — that we are bound to bear and forbear and that life to every one must be a compromise.</description>

Ibn AI-Rawandi
  Why I am not a Muslim by Ibn Warraq
(Prometheus Books, £15 to RPA members).
 In one of his early works the traditionalist writer Frithjof Schuon makes an acute observation about the mentality of Muslims: ‘The intellectual - and thereby the rational - foundation of Islam results in the average Muslim having a curious tendency to believe that non-Muslims either know that Islam is the truth and reject it out of pure obstinacy, or else are simply ignorant of it and can be converted by elementary explanations; that anyone should be able to oppose Islam with a good conscience quite exceeds the Muslim’s power of imagination, precisely because Islam coincides in his mind with the irresistible logic of things.</description>

HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN
III
[Mr. Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s tenacious quest for Hindu-Muslim unity]
Mr. Savarkar is quite unconcerned about the Muslim reaction to his scheme. He formulates his scheme and throws it in the face of the Muslims with the covering letter &amp;lsquo;take it or leave it.&amp;rsquo; He is not perturbed by the Muslim refusal to join in the struggle for Swaraj. He is quite conscious of the strength of the Hindus and the Hindu Maha Sabha and proposes to carry on the struggle in the confident hope that, alone and unaided, the Hindus will be able to wrest Swaraj from the British.</description>

Although I am in full sympathy with the various branches of religious and social work, I find that specification of work is absolutely necessary. Our special branch is to preach Vedanta. Helping in other work should be subservient to that one ideal.</description>

HINDU ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN
[IV]
[the number is missing in the printed text]
[The riot-torn history of Hindu-Muslim relations, 1920-1940]
Such is the history of Mr. Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s efforts to bring about Hindu-Moslem unity. What fruits did these efforts bear? To be able to answer this question it is necessary to examine the relationship between the two communities during 1920-40, the years during which Mr.</description>

DEAR FRANKINCENSE,
So Gopāla1 has taken the female form! It is fit that it should be so — the time and the place considering. May all blessings follow her through life. She was keenly desired, prayed for, and she comes as a blessing to you and to your wife for life. I have not the least doubt.
I wish I could have come to America now if only to fulfil the form &amp;ldquo;the sages of the East bringing presents to the Western baby&amp;rdquo;.</description>

MY DEAR MARY,
Things are turning out most curiously for me. From Colombo in Ceylon, where I landed, to Ramnad, the nearly southernmost point of the Indian continent where I am just now as the guest of the Raja of Ramnad, my journey has been a huge procession — crowds of people, illuminations, addresses, etc., etc. A monument forty feet high is being built on the spot where I landed.</description>

DEAR MRS. BULL,
Saradananda sends £20 to be placed in the famine relief in India. But as there is famine in his own home, I thought it best to relieve that first, as the old proverb says. So it has been employed accordingly.
I have not a moment to die as they stay, what with processions and tomtomings and various other methods of reception all over the country; I am almost dead.</description>

DEAR MARY,
A few days ago I received your beautiful letter. Yesterday came the card announcing Harriet&amp;rsquo;s marriage. Lord bless the happy pair!
The whole country here rose like one man to receive me. Hundreds of thousands of persons, shouting and cheering at every place, Rajas drawing my carriage, arches all over the streets of the capitals with blazing mottoes etc.,!!! The whole thing will soon come out in the form of a book, and you will have a copy soon.</description>

      <description>I hear some unavoidable domestic grief has come upon you. To you, a man of wisdom, what can this misery do? Yet the amenities of friendly intercourse, incidental to relative existence in this world, require my making mention of it. Those moments of grief, however, very often bring out a better spiritual realisation. As if for a while the clouds withdraw and the sun of truth shines out. In the case of some, half of the bondage is loosened.</description>

ALMORA,

DEAR RAKHAL,
I am wholly in sympathy with the subject-matter of the letter of Charu that you have sent me.
In the proposed Address to the Queen-Empress the following points should be noted:
1. That it must be free from exaggeration, in other words, statements to the effect that she is God&amp;rsquo;s regent and so forth, which are so common to us natives.</description>

MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA,
I am getting detailed reports of you and getting more and more delighted. It is that sort of work which can conquer the world. What do differences of sect and opinion matter? Bravo! Accept a hundred thousand embraces and blessings from me. Work, work, work — I care for nothing else. Work, work, work, even unto death! Those that are weak must make themselves great workers, great heroes — never mind money, it will drop from the heavens.</description>

Ibn Warraq grew up in a Muslim family. Islam is a jealous religion so that any man who grew up in a Muslim family and is, for that reason considered a Muslim, not by his own volition, has to remain a Muslim for life, or else he is sentenced to death, and this sentence will be carried out as soon as a Muslim assassin can get him in the crossed hairs.</description>

MUSLIM ALTERNATIVE TO PAKISTAN
I
[The proposed Hyderabad scheme of legislative reform is not promising]
The Hindus say they have an alternative to Pakistan. Have the Muslims also an alternative to Pakistan? The Hindus say yes, the Muslims say no. The Hindus believe that the Muslim proposal for Pakistan is only a bargaining manoeuvre put forth with the object of making additions to the communal gains already secured under the Communal Award.</description>

Glad to learn that you are better in health than before. Well, it is seldom that Brother Yogen reports the bare truths, so do not at all be anxious to hear them. I am all right now, with plenty of muscular strength, and no thirst. &amp;hellip; The liver, too, acts well. I am not certain as to what effects Shashi (Babu)&amp;rsquo;s medicine had.</description>

I am very glad to receive your letter and go through the contents. Your wishes about the orphanage are very good and Shri Maharaj (Shri Ramakrishna.) will not fail to fulfil them at an early date. Try your best to found a permanent centre. &amp;hellip; Never worry about money.

According to your instructions, I write a letter to Mr. Levinge, the Dist. Magistrate. Besides, you will write a big letter to the Indian Mirror, describing in detail his method of work (having got the same revised by Dr. Shashi), and send a copy of it to the gentleman named above.

I had a letter from Joe saying that you are both coming to India.

DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra)
Please be not anxious because I could not write to you and could not go to Belgaon. I was suffering very much from illness and it was impossible for me to go then. Now thanks to my travels in the Himalayas, I have greatly regained my health. I shall soon resume work. In two weeks I am going to the Punjab, and just after delivering a lecture or two at Lahore and Amritsar, I shall start via Karachi for Gujarat, Cutch, etc.</description>

DEAR SARADA,
I am sorry to learn from your letter that you are not doing well. If you can make an unpopular man popular, then I call you a clever fellow.

MURREE,

MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA,
I am very glad to receive your letter. You need not make a big plan for the present, but do only what is possible under existing circumstances. Gradually the way will open to you. We must certainly have the orphanage, no hesitating in that. We must not leave the girls in the lurch either. But then we must have a lady superintendent for an orphanage of girls.</description>

MURREE,
10th October, 1897.
DEAR RAKHAL,
Reached Murree from Kashmir in the evening of the day before yesterday. Everybody had an enjoyable time of it, only Krishnalal (Dhirananda) and Gupta (Sadananda) suffered now and then from fever, which, however, was but slight. This Address is to be sent to the Raja of Khetri. Have it printed in gilt etc. The Raja is expected at Bombay about the 21st or 22nd of October.</description>

DEAR M1 —
C’est bon, mon ami — now you are doing just the thing, Come out, man! No sleeping all life; time is flying. Bravo! That is the way.
Many thanks for your publication. Only, I am afraid it will not pay its way in a pamphlet form. . . . Never mind, pay or no pay — let it see the blaze of daylight.</description>

1. Legacy of hate
Hindus and Muslims must endeavour
to undo partition
By K. R. Malkani
 The Hindu-Muslim problem is a fact of Indian life. This problem is a legacy of the past, particularly that of the recent past, when the British gave it a new and dangerous twist, resulting in the partition of India. And it is a problem that sours relations, distorts the whole Indian polity and acts as a drag on the country.</description>

 CHAPTER IX
LESSONS FROM ABROAD
Hindus who will not yield to the demand of the Muslims for the division of India into Pakistan and Hindustan, and would insist upon maintaining the geographical unity of India without counting the cost, will do well to study the fate that has befallen other countries which, like India, harboured many nations and sought to harmonise them.
It is not necessary to review the history of all such countries.</description>

LAHORE,
15th November, 1897.
DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra)
It is a matter of deep regret that in spite of my earnest wishes, I do not find it feasible to go to Karachi this time and see you. First, because Captain and Mrs. Sevier, who have come from England and are travelling with me for the last nine months nearly, are very anxious to buy some land at Dehra Dun and start an orphanage there.</description>

      <description>I have duly received your letter and that of dear Haripada. Of course you have ample reason to feel sorry for, but you see, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it. And what took me here also became a fiasco; neither could I go to Sindh. It is the Lord&amp;rsquo;s will. Now, I have an idea of proceeding to Calcutta through Rajputana, Kathiawar, and Sindh. But some difficulty may crop up on the way.</description>

I appreciate your letter very much and am extremely happy to learn that the Lord is silently preparing wonderful things for our motherland.
Whether we call it Vedantism or any ism, the truth is that Advaitism is the last word of religion and thought and the only position from which one can look upon all religions and sects with love.</description>

It is a lazy life I am leading for the last two months, floating leisurely in a boat, which is also my home, up and down the beautiful Jhelum, through the most gorgeous scenery God&amp;rsquo;s world can afford, in nature&amp;rsquo;s own park, where the earth, air, land, grass, plants, trees, mountains, snows, and the human form, all express, on the outside at least, the beauty of the Lord — with almost no possessions, scarcely a pen or an inkstand even, snatching up a meal whenever or wherever convenient, the very ideal of a Rip Van Winkle!</description>

. . . It seems there is a gloom over your mind. Never mind, nothing is to last for ever. Anyhow life is not eternal. I am so, so thankful for it. Suffering is the lot of the world&amp;rsquo;s best and bravest — yet, for aeons yet — till things are righted; if possible, here — at least it is a discipline which breaks the dream.</description>

2. BJP shifts stand to woo Muslims
By S.N.M. Abdi
 KISHANGANJ, March 1 - The BJP is wooing the electorate in this Muslim-dominated district, 18 km from the Indo-Bangladesh border, by inviting Bangladeshis to enter “not in a clandestine manner but through the front door”.
The change in the BJP’s rigid stand on “infiltration” has given the party a foothold in Thakurganj, Bahadurganj and Kishanganj constituencies, which go to the polls shortly.</description>

CHAPTER X
SOCIAL STAGNATION
I
[Muslim Society is even more full of social evils than Hindu Society is]
The social evils which characterize the Hindu Society, have been well known. The publication of Mother India by Miss Mayo gave these evils the widest publicity. But while Mother India served the purpose of exposing the evils and calling their authors at the bar of the world to answer for their sins, it created the unfortunate impression throughout the world that while the Hindus were grovelling in the mud of these social evils and were conservative, the Muslims in India were free from them, and as compared to the Hindus, were a progressive people.</description>

You are perfectly right; I am brutal, very indeed. But about the tenderness etc., that is my fault.

I am afraid that the rest and peace I seek for will never come. But Mother does good to others through me, at least some to my native land, and it is easier to be reconciled to one&amp;rsquo;s fate as a sacrifice. We are all sacrifices — each in his own way. The great work is going on — no one can see its meaning except that it is a great sacrifice.</description>

DEAR NIVEDITA,
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work. I want to be quiet and rest. I know the time and the place; but the fate or Karma, I think, drives me on — work, work. We are like cattle driven to the slaughter-house — hastily nibbling a bite of grass on the roadside as they are driven along under the whip. And all this is our work, our fear — fear, the beginning of misery, of disease, etc.</description>

      <description>CLVI SAN FRANCISCO,
25th March, 1900.
DEAR NIVEDITA,
I am much better and am growing very strong. I feel sometimes that freedom is near at hand, and the tortures of the last two years have been great lessons in many ways. Disease and misfortune come to do us good in the long run, although at the time we feel that we are submerged for ever.
I am the infinite blue sky; the clouds may gather over me, but I am the same infinite blue.</description>

I am so glad at your good fortune. Things have got to come round if we are steady. I am sure you will get all the money you require here or in England.
I am working hard; and the harder I work, the better I feel. This ill health has done me a great good, sure.</description>

MY DEAR JOE,
Just now I received yours and Mrs. Bull&amp;rsquo;s welcome letter. I direct this to London. I am so glad Mrs. Leggett is on the sure way to recovery.
I am so sorry Mr. Leggett resigned the presidentship.
Well, I keep quiet for fear of making further trouble.
You know my methods are extremely harsh and once roused I may rattle A— too much for his peace of mind.</description>

3. BJP promoting a ‘minority-friendly’
image for elections
Express New Service
 New Delhi - While declaring that liberation of the Varanasi and Mathura temples was not on its agenda, the Bharatiya Janata Party has not entirely foreclosed the potentially emotional issues.
Fashioning an ambivalent strategy ahead of the next year’s general elections, the BJP after its Panaji session, has sought to don a “minority-friendly” image, while insisting that its “basic image will stay intact”.</description>

 CHAPTER XI
COMMUNAL AGGRESSION
Even a superficial observer cannot fail to notice that a spirit of aggression underlies the Hindu attitude towards the Muslim and the Muslim attitude towards the Hindu. The Hindu&amp;rsquo;s spirit of aggression is a new phase which he has just begun to cultivate. The Muslim&amp;rsquo;s spirit of aggression is his native endowment, and is ancient as compared with that of the Hindu.</description>

The representatives came from various countries, from India in the south, to Scotland in the north, with England and America buttressing the sides.
We were having great difficulty in electing the president, for though Dr. James (Professor William James) was there, he was more mindful of the blisters raised on him by Mrs. Melton (probably a magnetic healer) than solution of world problems.</description>

NATIONAL FRUSTRATION
I
[Can Hindus count on Muslims to show national rather than religious loyalty?]
Suppose an Indian was asked, what is the highest destiny you wish for your country, what would be his answer? The question is important, and the answer cannot but be instructive.
There can be no doubt that other things being equal, a hundred-per-cent Indian, proud of his country, would say, &amp;ldquo;An integral and independent India is my ideal of India&amp;rsquo;s destiny.</description>

NATIONAL FRUSTRATION
III
[The necessary national political loyalty is not present among Muslims]
Notwithstanding this difference in their ultimate destiny, an attempt is made to force the Hindus and Muslims to live in one country, as one people, bound by the political ties of a single constitution. Assuming that this is done and that the Muslims are somehow manoeuvred into it, what guarantee is there that the constitution will not break down ?</description>

(This day marks the beginning of the regular teaching given daily by Swami Vivekananda to his disciples at Thousand Island Park. We had not yet all assembled there, but the Master&amp;rsquo;s heart was always in his work, so he commenced at once to teach the three or four who were with him. He came on this first morning with the Bible in his hand and opened to the Book of John, saying that since we were all Christians, it was proper that he should begin with the Christian scriptures.</description>

Be brave and be sincere; then follow any path with devotion, and you must reach the Whole. Once lay hold of one link of the chain, and the whole chain must come by degrees. Water the roots of the tree (that is, reach the Lord), and the whole tree is watered; getting the Lord, we get all.

After every happiness comes misery; they may be far apart or near. The more advanced the soul, the more quickly does one follow the other. What we want is neither happiness nor misery. Both make us forget our true nature; both are chains — one iron, one gold; behind both is the Atman, who knows neither happiness nor misery.</description>

Our best work is done, our greatest influence is exerted, when we are without thought of self. All great geniuses know this. Let us open ourselves to the one Divine Actor, and let Him act, and do nothing ourselves. &amp;ldquo;O Arjuna! I have no duty in the whole world&amp;rdquo;, says Krishna.

To try to think without a phantasm is to try to make the impossible possible. We cannot think &amp;ldquo;mammalia&amp;rdquo; without a concrete example. So with the idea of God.
The great abstraction of ideas in the world is what we call God.
Each thought has two parts — the thinking and the word; and we must have both. Neither idealists nor materialists are right; we must take both idea and expression.</description>

Shri Ramakrishna was the son of a very orthodox Brahmin, who would refuse even a gift from any but a special caste of Brahmins; neither might he work, nor even be a priest in a temple, nor sell books, nor serve anyone.

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) TUESDAY, July 2, 1895. (The Divine Mother.)
Shāktas worship the Universal Energy as Mother, the sweetest name they know; for the mother is the highest ideal of womanhood in India. When God is worshipped as &amp;ldquo;Mother&amp;rdquo;, as Love, the Hindus call it the &amp;ldquo;right-handed&amp;rdquo; way, and it leads to spirituality but never to material prosperity. When God is worshipped on His terrible side, that is, in the &amp;ldquo;left-handed&amp;rdquo; way, it leads usually to great material prosperity, but rarely to spirituality; and eventually it leads to degeneration and the obliteration of the race that practices it.</description>

Generally speaking, human religion begins with fear. &amp;ldquo;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&amp;rdquo; But later comes the higher idea. &amp;ldquo;Perfect love casteth out fear.&amp;rdquo; Traces of fear will remain with us until we get knowledge, know what God is. Christ, being man, had to see impurity and denounced it; but God, infinitely higher, does not see iniquity and cannot be angry.</description>

Until you are ready to change any minute, you can never see the truth; but you must hold fast and be steady in the search for truth. . . .
Chārvākas, a very ancient sect in India, were rank materialists. They have died out now, and most of their books are lost. They claimed that the soul, being the product of the body and its forces, died with it; that there was no proof of its further existence.</description>

Om tat sat! According to Shankara, there are two phases of the universe, one is I and the other thou; and they are as contrary as light and darkness, so it goes without saying that neither can be derived from the other.

Infinite manifestation dividing itself in portion still remains infinite, and each portion is infinite.1
Brahman is the same in two forms — changeable and unchangeable, expressed and unexpressed. Know that the Knower and the known are one. The Trinity — the Knower, the known, and knowing — is manifesting as this universe. That God the Yogi sees in meditation, he sees through the power of his own Self.</description>

There is no place for reasoning in Madhva&amp;rsquo;s explanation, it is all taken from the revelation in the Vedas.
Ramanuja says, the Vedas are the holiest study. Let the sons of the three upper castes get the Sutra (The holy thread.) and at eight, ten, or eleven years of age begin the study, which means going to a Guru and learning the Vedas word for word, with perfect intonation and pronunciation.</description>

Man as Atman is really free; as man he is bound, changed by every physical condition. As man, he is a machine with an idea of freedom; but this human body is the best and the human mind the highest mind there is. When a man attains to the Atman state, he can take a body, making it to suit himself; he is above law.</description>

There are sixty-five million Mohammedans in India, some of them Sufis.1 Sufis identify man with God, and through them this idea came into Europe. They say, &amp;ldquo;I am that Truth&amp;rdquo;; but they have an esoteric as well as an exoteric doctrine, although Mohammed himself did not hold it.
&amp;ldquo;Hashshashin&amp;quot;2 has become our word &amp;ldquo;assassin&amp;rdquo;, because an old sect of Mohammedanism killed nonbelievers as a part of its creed.</description>

7. Pampering the minority ego
Talveen Singh
 Are there no limits to what Muslims can demand, and get away with, in the imagined cause of their religion? India is not a Muslim country and, by the grace of our 30 million gods, never will be. So there is no reason why our political leaders should have to start kowtowing and running scared everytime a bunch of semi-literate mullahs gets up and starts making a noise.</description>

NATIONAL FRUSTRATION
V
[The vision of Pakistan is powerful, and has been implicitly present for decades]
While it is necessary to admit that the efforts at Hindu-Muslim unity have failed and that the Muslim ideology has undergone a complete revolution, it is equally necessary to know the precise causes which have produced these effects. The Hindus say that the British policy of divide and rule is the real cause of this failure and of this ideological revolution.</description>

Without mother-love no creation could continue. Nothing is entirely physical, nor yet entirely metaphysical; one presupposes the other and explains the other. All Theists agree that there is a background to this visible universe, they differ as to the nature or character of that background. Materialists say there is no background.
In all religions the superconscious state is identical.</description>

Fourth Vyasa Sutra. &amp;ldquo;Âtman (is) the aim of all.&amp;rdquo;
Ishvara is to be known from the Vedanta; all Vedas point to Him (Who is the Cause; the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer). Ishvara is the unification of the Trinity, known as Brahmā, Vishnu, and Shiva, which stand at the head of the Hindu Pantheon. &amp;ldquo;Thou art our Father who takest us to the other shore of the dark ocean&amp;rdquo; (Disciple&amp;rsquo;s words to the Master).</description>

      <description>RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE) SATURDAY, July 13th, 1895.
Everything we know is a compound, and all sense-knowledge comes through analysis. To think that mind is a simple, single, or independent is dualism. Philosophy is not got by studying books; the more you read books, the more muddled becomes the mind. The idea of unthinking philosophers was that the mind was a simple, and this led them to believe in free-will.</description>

Philosophy in India means that through which we see God, the rationale of religion; so no Hindu could ever ask for a link between religion and philosophy.
Concrete, generalised, abstract are the three stages in the process of philosophy. The highest abstraction in which all things agree is the One. In religion we have first, symbols and forms; next, mythologies; and last, philosophy.</description>

Where there is polyandry, as in Tibet, women are physically stronger than the men. When the English go there, these women carry large men up the mountains.
In Malabar, although of course polyandry does not obtain there, the women lead in everything. Exceptional cleanliness is apparent everywhere and there is the greatest impetus to learning. When I myself was in that country, I met many women who spoke good Sanskrit, while in the rest of India not one woman in a million can speak it.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;unseen cause&amp;rdquo; (Or mass of subtle impressions.) leads us to sacrifice and worship, which in turn produce seen results; but to attain liberation we must first hear, then think or reason, and then meditate upon Brahman.
The result of works and the result of knowledge are two different things. &amp;ldquo;Do&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do not do&amp;rdquo; are the background of all morality, but they really belong only to the body and the mind.</description>

Rāmānuja divides the universe into Chit, Achit, and Ishvara — man, nature, and God; conscious, subconscious, and superconscious. Shankara, on the contrary, says that Chit, the soul, is the same as God. God is truth, is knowledge, is infinity; these are not qualities. Any thought of God is a qualification, and all that can be said of Him is &amp;ldquo;Om tat sat&amp;rdquo;.</description>

(The lesson today was mainly Shankara&amp;rsquo;s argument against the conclusion of the Sānkhya philosophy.)
The Sankhyas say that consciousness is a compound, and beyond that, the last analysis gives us the Purusha, Witness, but that there are many Purushas — each of us is one. Advaita, on the contrary, affirms that Purushas can be only One, that Purusha cannot be conscious, unconscious, or have any qualification, for either these qualities would bind, or they would eventually cease; so the One must be without any qualities, even knowledge, and It cannot be the cause of the universe or of anything.</description>

So long as I say &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo;, I have the right to speak of God protecting us. When I see another, I must take all the consequences and put in the third, the ideal, which stands between us; that is the apex of the triangle. The vapour becomes snow, then water, then Ganga; but when it is vapour, there is no Ganga, and when it is water, we think of no vapour in it.</description>

Perception is our only real knowledge or religion. Talking about it for ages will never make us know our soul. There is no difference between theories and atheism. In fact, the atheist is the truer man. Every step I take in the light is mine for ever. When you go to a country and see it, then it is yours.</description>

 BOMBAY - The Koran in Sanskrit? The idea is not as bizarre as it may sound.

[The burden of proof on the advocates of Pakistan is a heavy one]
With all that has gone before, the sceptic, the nationalist, the conservative and the old-world Indian will not fail to ask &amp;ldquo;Must there be Pakistan?&amp;rdquo; No one can make light of such an attitude. For the problem of Pakistan is indeed very grave, and it must be admitted that the question is not only a relevant and fair one to be put to the Muslims and to their protagonists, but it is also important.</description>

Yoga is the science of restraining the Chitta (mind) from breaking into Vrittis (modifications). Mind is a mixture of sensation and feelings, or action and reaction; so it cannot be permanent. The mind has a fine body and through this it works on the gross body. Vedanta says that behind the mind is the real Self.</description>

To attain liberation through work, join yourself to work but without desire, looking for no result. Such work leads to knowledge, which in turn brings emancipation. To give up work before you know, leads to misery. Work done for the Self gives no bondage. Neither desire pleasure nor fear pain from work. It is the mind and body that work, not I.</description>

The powers acquired by the practice of Yoga are not obstacles for the Yogi who is perfect, but are apt to be so for the beginner, through the wonder and pleasure excited by their exercise. Siddhis are the powers which mark success in the practice; and they may be produced by various means, such as the repetition of a Mantra, by Yoga practice, meditation, fasting, or even by the use of herbs and drugs.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Things may be done, caused to be done, or approved of&amp;rdquo;, and the effect upon us is nearly equal.
Complete continence gives great intellectual and spiritual power. The Brahmachārin must be sexually pure in thought, word, and deed. Lose regard for the body; get rid of the consciousness of it so far as possible.
Âsana (posture) must be steady and pleasant; and constant practice, identifying the mind with the Infinite, will bring this about.</description>

Not even can we say &amp;ldquo;is&amp;rdquo; about it, for that too is relative. Any imagination, any concept is in vain. Neti, neti (&amp;ldquo;Not this, not this&amp;rdquo;) is all that can be said, for even to think is to limit and so to lose.</description>

Christs and Buddhas are simply occasions upon which to objectify our own inner powers. We really answer our own prayers.
It is blasphemy to think that if Jesus had never been born, humanity would not have been saved. It is horrible to forget thus the divinity in human nature, a divinity that must come out. Never forget the glory of human nature.</description>

Luther drove a nail into religion when he took away renunciation and gave us morality instead. Atheists and materialists can have ethics, but only believers in the Lord can have religion.
The wicked pay the price of the great soul&amp;rsquo;s holiness. Think of that when you see a wicked man. Just as the poor man&amp;rsquo;s labour pays for the rich man&amp;rsquo;s luxury, so is it in the spiritual world.</description>

EXCERPTS: Preaching love and tolerance
By Ali S. Asani
Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, who lies buried in Ajmer, was one of the most revered sufis of India. Ali S. Asani
writes about him and his admirers.
Who was Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti and why has his dargah attained such pre-eminence? Although Muinuddin Chishti looms large in the history of Islam and Sufism in South Asia, we have, unfortunately, very little accurate information about him, because of an absence of reliable contemporary sources.</description>

The real Guru is the one through whom we have our spiritual descent. He is the channel through which the spiritual current flows to us, the link which joins us to the whole spiritual world. Too much faith in personality has a tendency to produce weakness and idolatry, but intense love for the Guru makes rapid growth possible, he connects us with the internal Guru.</description>

Nishthā (devotion to one ideal) is the beginning of realisation. &amp;ldquo;Take the honey out of all flowers; sit and be friendly with all, pay reverence to all, say to all, &amp;lsquo;Yes, brother, yes, brother&amp;rsquo;, but keep firm in your own way.&amp;rdquo; A higher stage is actually to take the position of the other. If I am all, why can I not really and actively sympathise with my brother and see with his eyes?</description>

Individuals who are to get freedom in this life have to live thousands of years in one lifetime. They have to be ahead of their times, but the masses can only crawl. Thus we have Christs and Buddhas. . . .
There was once a Hindu queen, who so much desired that all her children should attain freedom in this life that she herself took all the care of them; and as she rocked them to sleep, she sang always the one song to them — &amp;ldquo;Tat tvam asi, Tat tvam asi&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;That thou art, That thou art&amp;rdquo;).</description>

&amp;ldquo;Whom the ignorant worship, Him I preach unto thee.&amp;rdquo;
This one and only God is the &amp;ldquo;knownest&amp;rdquo; of the known. He is the one thing we see everywhere. All know their own Self, all know, &amp;ldquo;I am&amp;rdquo;, even animals. All we know is the projection of the Self. Teach this to the children, they can grasp it. Every religion has worshipped the Self, even though unconsciously, because there is nothing else.</description>

The question is: Is it necessary to pass through all the lower stages to reach the highest, or can a plunge be taken at once? The modern American boy takes twenty-five years to attain that which his forefathers took hundreds of years to do. The present-day Hindu gets in twenty years to the height reached in eight thousand years by his ancestors.</description>

Without the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; there can be no &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; outside. From this some philosophers came to the conclusion that the external world did not exist save in the subject; that the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; existed only in the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. Others have argued that the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; can only be known through the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; and with equal logic. These two views are partial truths, each wrong in part and each right in part.</description>

10. More Space for ‘namaaz’ urged
By Vidyadhar Date
 BOMBAY, April 28.
Some leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra have proposed that the floor space index (FSI) for mosques in Bombay be increased to accommodate a larger number of people offering namaaz (prayers). This would also help end offering of prayers on the roads outside mosques.*
The offering of namaaz on roads had caused considerable tension in Bombay two years ago with the Shiv Sena and the BJP voicing strong protests and organising maha artis on the roads.</description>

[Partition is a very possible contingency for which it&amp;rsquo;s best to be prepared]
There are two sides to the question of Pakistan, the Hindu side and the Muslim side. This cannot be avoided. Unfortunately, however, the attitude of both is far from rational. Both are deeply embedded in sentiment. The layers of this sentiment are so thick that reason at present finds it extremely difficult to penetrate.</description>

The disciple passed the preceding night in Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s room. At 4 a.m. Swamiji roused him and said &amp;ldquo;Go and knock up the Sadhus and Brahmacharins from sleep with the bell.&amp;rdquo; In pursuance of the order, the disciple rang the bell near the Sadhus who slept. The monastic inmates hastened to go to the worship-room for meditation.</description>

[Place: The Math, Belur. Year: 1902.]
Swamiji was now staying at the Math. The disciple came to the Math and towards the evening accompanied Swamiji and Swami Premananda for a walk. Finding Swamiji absorbed in thought, the disciple entered into a conversation with Swami Premananda on what Shri Ramakrishna used to say of Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s greatness.</description>

While walking on the banks of the Ganga at Calcutta one afternoon, the disciple saw a Sannyasin in the distance approaching towards Ahiritola Ghat. While he came near, the disciple found the Sannyasin to be no other than his Guru, Swami Vivekananda.</description>

Today is the first of Âshārh (June-July). The disciple has come to the Math before dusk from Bally, with his office-dress on, as he has not found time to change it. Coming to the Math, he prostrated himself at the feet of Swamiji and inquired about his health.</description>

(Translated from Bengali )
[Shri Priya Nath Sinha]
We evince a sad lack of restraint in conversation or any conjoint action such as music and so on. Everyone tries to put himself foremost. The jostling at railway or steamer station is another illustration of this. A friend of Swamiji had a talk with him one day at the Math on this subject. Swamiji remarked, &amp;ldquo;You see, we have an old adage: &amp;lsquo;If your son is not inclined to study, put him in the Durbars (Sābha).</description>

[Shri Priya Nath Sinha]
Arrangements were being made for Swamiji&amp;rsquo;s leaving India for America for the second time (1899 A.D.). He had gone to Calcutta to see one of his friends, and returning from there stopped for a few minutes at Balaram Babu&amp;rsquo;s house at Baghbazar. He then sent for another friend to accompany him to the Math. The friend came, and the following conversation took place between him and Swamiji:</description>

VENGEANCE OF HISTORY
(Mrs. Wright)
[At the end of August 1893, Swami Vivekananda stayed at Annisquam at the house of Prof. J. H. Wright. So astonishing a sight did Swamiji present in this quiet little New England village that speculations set in at once as to who this majestic and colourful figure might be. From where had he come? At first they decided that he was a Brahmin from India, but his manners did not fully conform to their ideas.</description>

RELIGIOUS HARMONY
(The Detroit Free Press, February 14, 1894)
Swami is a person of medium stature, with the dusky complexion common with people of his nationality, gentle in manner, deliberate in movement, and extremely courteous in every word, movement, and gesture. But the most striking feature of his personality are his eyes, which are of great brilliancy. The conversation naturally drifted upon the subject of religion, when Swami said among many other striking remarks:</description>

13. Secret of BJP’s success
K.R. Malkani
 Only a year ago when the BJP did not get as many seats in UP, MP and Himachal Pradesh as expected, many people thought that the party had passed its peak. Not many of them paused to consider that even in its reduced state the party had polled one crore votes more - and won a hundred seats more - than the Congress.</description>

FALLEN WOMEN
(The Detroit Tribune, March 17, 1894)
&amp;ldquo;Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was her very great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve, as everyone knows. In the West people say rude things about Lalun&amp;rsquo;s profession and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that morality may be preserved. In the East, where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice.</description>

      <description>NOTE
Swami Vivekananda left Calcutta for the West, for the second time, on the 20th June, 1899, by the BISN steamship Golconda. In reading these pages the reader should remember that Swamiji wrote them in a light, humorous tone in Bengali, which it is impossible to render in English.
The second section of these memoirs, relates to his return journey from the West at the end of 1900.
These were originally published in the Udbodhan.</description>

I
Om Namo Nārāyanāya, (&amp;ldquo;Salutations to the Lord&amp;rdquo;; the usual form of addressing a Sannyasin. These memoirs of his second journey to the West were addressed to Swami Trigunatitananda, Editor, Udbodhan and hence this form of address.) Swāmi. — Pronounce the last syllable of the second word in a high pitch, brother, in the Hrishikesh fashion. For seven days we have been on board the ship and every day I think of writing to you something about our mode of life, and of writing materials also you have given me enough, but the characteristic lethargy of a Bengali stands in the way and foils everything.</description>

We have an adage among us that one that has a disc-like pattern on the soles of his feet becomes a vagabond. I fear, I have my soles inscribed all over with them. And there is not much room for probability, either. I have tried my best to discover them by scrutinising the soles, but all to no purpose — the feet have been dreadfully cracked through the severity of cold, and no discs or anything of the kind could be traced.</description>

The first view of Constantinople we had from the train.

      <description>ON ART In art, interest must be centred on the principal theme. Drama is the most difficult of all arts. In it two things are to be satisfied — first, the ears, and second, the eyes. To paint a scene, if one thing be painted, it is easy enough; but to paint different things and yet to keep up the central interest is very difficult. Another difficult thing is stage-management, that is, combining different things in such a manner as to keep the central interest intact.</description>

Feeling is the soul, the secret of everything. There is more music in common people&amp;rsquo;s songs, and they should be collected together. The science of Dhrupad etc., applied to the music of Kirtana will produce the perfect music.</description>

      <description>ON MANTRA AND MANTRA-CHAITANYA The Mantra-Shāstris (upholders of the Mantra theory) believe that some words have been handed down through a succession of teachers and disciples, and the mere utterance of them will lead to some form of realisation. There are two different meanings of the word Mantra-chaitanya. According to some, if you practise the repetition of a certain Mantra, you will see the Ishta-Devatā who is the object or deity of that Mantra.</description>

      <description>ON CONCEPTIONS OF GODHEAD Man&amp;rsquo;s inner hankering is to find some one who is free, that is, beyond the laws of nature. The Vedantins believe in such an Eternal Ishvara, while the Buddhists and the Sānkhyas believe only a Janyeshvara (created God), that is, a God who was a man before, but has become God through spiritual practice. The Purānas reconcile these two positions by the doctrine of Incarna tion. That is, they say that the Janyeshvara is nothing but the Nitya (Eternal) Ishvara, taking by Māyā the form of a Janyeshvara.</description>

      <description>ON FOOD You preach to others to be men but cannot give them good food. I have been thinking over this problem for the last four years. I wish to make an experiment whether something of the nature of flattened rice can be made out of wheat. Then we can get a different food every day. About drinking water, I searched for a filter which would suit our country. I found one pan-like porcelain vessel through which water was made to pass, and all the bacilli remained in the porcelain pan.</description>

 LONDON, August 23 - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president L.K. Advani criticised the Rao government’s Kashmir policy, promised a tougher approach if his party came to power and urged the Indian community in Britain to counter the lobbying by the Pakistanis.
He sought to mobilise the Indian community at a meeting organised by the “Overseas Friends of the BJP” and said that there could be no dialogue with terrorists.</description>

      <description>ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE Talking of the respective duties of a monk and a householder, Swamiji said:
A Sannyasin should avoid the food, bedding, etc., which have been touched or used by householders, in order to save himself — not from hatred towards them — so long as he has not risen to the highest grade, that is, become a Paramahamsa. A householder should salute him with &amp;ldquo;Namo Nārāyanāya&amp;rdquo;, and a Sannyasin should bless the former.</description>

      <description>ON QUESTIONING THE COMPETENCY OF THE GURU In the course of a conversation Swamiji spiritedly remarked, &amp;ldquo;Leave off your commercial calculating ideas. If you can get rid of your attachment to a single thing, you are on the way to liberation. Do not see a public woman, or sinner, or Sādhu. That vile woman also is the Divine Mother. A Sannyāsin says once, twice, that she is Mother; then he gets deluded again and says, &amp;lsquo;Hence, O vile, unchaste woman!</description>

      <description>SHRI RAMAKRISHNA THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS LIFE AND TEACHINGS In a narrow society there is depth and intensity of spirituality. The narrow stream is very rapid. In a catholic society, along with the breadth of vision we find a proportionate loss in depth and intensity. But the life of Sri Ramakrishna upsets all records of history. It is a remarkable phenomenon that in Sri Ramakrishna there has been an assemblage of ideas deeper than the sea and vaster than the skies.</description>

      <description>ON SHRI RAMAKRISHNA AND HIS VIEWS By force, think of one thing at least as Brahman. Of course it is easier to think of Ramakrishna as God, but the danger is that we cannot form Ishvara-buddhi (vision of Divinity) in others. God is eternal, without any form, omnipresent. To think of Him as possessing any form is blasphemy. But the secret of image-worship is that you are trying to develop your vision of Divinity in one thing.</description>

      <description>SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION&amp;rsquo;S IDEAL In order that a nation may rise, it must have a high ideal. Now, that ideal is, of course, the abstract Brahman. But as you all cannot be inspired by an abstract ideal, you must have a personal ideal. You have got that, in the person of Shri Ramakrishna. The reason why other personages cannot be our ideal now is, that their days are gone; and in order that Vedanta may come to everyone, there must be a person who is in sympathy with the present generation.</description>

      <description>MERCINARIES IN RELIGION (Delivered in Minneapolis on November 26, 1893:
Reported in the Minneapolis Journal)
The Unitarian church was crowded yesterday morning by an audience anxious to learn something of eastern religious thought as outlined by Swami Vivekananda, a Brahmin priest, who was prominent in the Parliament of Religions at Chicago last summer. The distinguished representative of the Brahmin faith was brought to Minneapolis by the Peripatetic Club, and he addressed that body last Friday evening.</description>

      <description>THE DESTINY OF MAN (Delivered in Memphis on January 17, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
The audience was moderately large, and was made up of the best literary and musical talent of the city, including some of the most distinguished members of the legal fraternity and financial institutions.
The speaker differs in one respect in particular from some American orators. He advances his ideas with as much deliberation as a professor of mathematics demon strates an example in algebra to his students.</description>

      <description>REINCARNATION (Delivered in Memphis on January 19, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
Swami Vive Kananda, the beturbaned and yellow-robed monk, lectured again last night to a fair-sized and appreciative audience at the La Salette Academy on Third street.
The subject was &amp;ldquo;Transmigration of the Soul, or &amp;ldquo;metempsychosis&amp;rdquo;. Possibly Vive Kananda never appeared to greater advantage than in this role, so to speak. Metempsychosis is one of the most widely-accepted beliefs among the Eastern races, and one that they are ever ready to defend, at home or abroad.</description>

      <description>COMPARATIVE THEOLOGY (Delivered in Memphis on January 21, 1894:
Reported in Appeal-Avalanche)
&amp;ldquo;Comparative Theology&amp;rdquo; was the subject of a discourse last night by Swami Vive Kananda at the Young Men&amp;rsquo;s Hebrew Association Hall. It was the blue-ribbon lecture of the series, and no doubt increased the general admiration the people of this city entertain for the learned gentleman.
Heretofore Vive Kananda has lectured for the benefit of one charity-worthy object or another, and it can be safely said that he has rendered them material aid.</description>

15. BJP bid to woo Muslims
The Times of India News Service
 ALIGARH, October 15 - The BJP today kicked off its pre-election campaign to woo Muslim voters by promising to provide a “riot-free India in which human rights of all sections would be protected”.
Addressing the first state convention of the newly-formed minority front of the BJP, former national president of the party Murli Manohar Joshi urged Muslims to take a “fresh look” at the BJP, if they wished to escape from the clutches of the Congress, which he alleged had been “exploiting them over the past several decades”.</description>

      <description>THE SCIENCE OF YOGA (Fragmentary notes of a lecture recorded by Ida Ansell and reprinted from Vedanta and the West, July-August 1957.)
(Delivered at Tucker Hall, Alameda, California, on April 13, 1900)
The old Sanskrit word Yoga is defined as [Chittavrittinirodha]. It means that Yoga is the science that teaches us to bring the Chitta under control from the state of change. The Chitta is the stuff from which our minds are made and which is being constantly churned into waves by external and internal influences.</description>

Before leaving for the USA, Swamiji used to change his name very often. In earlier years he signed as Narendra or Naren; then for some time as Vividishananda or Sachchidananda. But for the convenience of the readers, these volumes use the more familiar name Vivekananda.

Glory to Ramakrishna!
BAIDYANATH,
25th December, 1889.
DEAR SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I have been staying for the last few days at Baidyanath in Purna Babu&amp;rsquo;s Lodge. It is not so cold, and my health too is indifferent. I am suffering from indigestion, probably due to excess of iron in the water. I have found nothing agreeable here — neither the place, nor the season, nor the company.</description>

ALLAHABAD,
30th December, 1889.
DEAR SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
Gupta left a slip when coming and the next day a letter from Yogananda gave me all the news and I immediately started for Allahabad which I reached the day after, to find that Yogananda had completely recovered. He had chicken-pox (with one or two smallpox rashes also). The doctor is a noble soul, and they have got a brotherhood, who are all great pious men and highly devoted to the service of Sādhus.</description>

GHAZIPUR,

REVERED SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I am now stopping with Satish Babu at Ghazipur. Of the few places I have recently visited, this is the healthiest. The water of Baidyanath is very bad — it leads to indigestion. Allahabad is very congested. The few days I passed at Varanasi, I suffered from fever day and night — the place is so malarious!</description>

Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!
C/O Satish Mukherji,
GORABAZAR, GHAZIPUR.
14th February, 1890.
REVERED SIR (Shri Balaram Bose),
I am in receipt of your letter of contrition. I am not leaving this place soon — it is impossible to avoid the Babaji&amp;rsquo;s request. You have expressed remorse at not having reaped any appreciable results by serving the Sadhus. It is true, and yet not true; it is true if you look towards ideal bliss; but if you look behind to the place from which you started, you will find that before you were an animal, now you are a man, and will be a god or God Himself in future.</description>

MY DEAR GUPTA (Swami Sadananda),
I hope you are doing well. Do your own spiritual exercises, and knowing yourself to be the humblest servant of all, serve them. Those with whom you are staying are such that even I am not worthy to call myself their humblest servant and take the dust of their feet. Knowing this, serve them and have devotion for them.</description>

Received your kind note yesterday. I am very sorry to learn that Suresh Babu&amp;rsquo;s illness is extremely serious. What is destined will surely happen. It is a matter of great regret that you too have fallen ill. So long as egoism lasts, any shortcoming in adopting remedial measures is to be considered as idleness — it is a fault and a guilt. For one who has not that egoistic idea, the best course is to forbear.</description>

VIII SALEM (U.S.A.),
30th Aug., 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (HONOURABLE PROFESSOR) (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I am going off from here today. I hope you have received some reply from Chicago. I have received an invitation with full directions from Mr. Sanborn. So I am going to Saratoga on Monday. My respects to your wife. And my love to Austin and all the children. You are a real Mahātmā (a great soul) and Mrs.</description>

Saturday, 4th Sept., 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I hasten to tender my heartfelt gratitude to you for your letters of introduction. I have received a letter from Mr. Theles of Chicago giving me the names of some of the delegates and other things about the Congress.
Your professor of Sanskrit in his note to Miss Sanborn mistakes me for Purushottama Joshi and states that there is a Sanskrit library in Boston the like of which can scarcely be met with in India.</description>

      <description>X CHICAGO,
2nd October, 1893.
DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
I do not know what you are thinking of my long silence. In the first place I dropped in on the Congress in the eleventh hour, and quite unprepared; and that kept me very very busy for some time. Secondly, I was speaking almost every day in the Congress and had no time to write; and last and greatest of all — my kind friend, I owe so much to you that it would have been an insult to your ahetuka (unselfish) friendship to have written you business-like letters in a hurry.</description>

XI CHICAGO,
10th October, 1893.
DEAR MRS. TANNATT WOODS,
I received your letter yesterday. Just now I am lecturing about Chicago — and am doing as I think very well; it is ranging from 30 to 80 dollars a lecture, and just now I have been so well advertised in Chicago gratis by the Parliament of Religions that it is not advisable to give up this field now. To which I am sure you will agree.</description>

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),
You would be glad to know that I am doing well here and that almost everybody has been very kind to me, except of course the very orthodox. Many of the men brought together here from far-off lands have got projects and ideas and missions to carry out, and America is the only place where there is a chance of success for everything.</description>

DEAR MRS. WOODS,
Excuse my delay in answering your letter. I do not know when I will be able to see you again. I am starting tomorrow for Madison and Minneapolis.
The English gentleman you speak of is Dr. Momerie of London. He is a well-known worker amongst the poor of London and is a very sweet man. You perhaps do not know that the English church was the only religious denomination in the world who did not send to us a representative, and Dr.</description>

DEAR BROTHER,1
Your letter just reached me here. I am in a hurry, so excuse a few points which I would take the liberty of correcting you in.
In the first place, I have not one word to say against any religion or founder of religion in the world — whatever you may think of our religion. All religions are sacred to me. Secondly, it is a misstatement that I said that missionaries do not learn our vernaculars.</description>

Your letter reached me yesterday. You were perfectly right — I enjoyed the fun of the lunatic Interior, (Chicago Interior, a Presbyterian newspaper which opposed Swamiji. — Ed.) but the mail you sent yesterday from India was really, as Mother Church says in her letter, a good news after a long interval.

DEAR BROTHER SHIVANANDA,
Your letter just reached me. Perhaps by this time you have received my other letters and learnt that it is not necessary to send anything to America any more. Too much of everything is bad. This newspaper booming has given me popularity no doubt, but its effect is more in India than here. Here, on the other hand, constant booming creates a distaste in the minds of the higher class people; so enough.</description>

Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!
1894.
DEAR AND BELOVED (Swami Brahmananda.),
. . . Well, do you think there is any religion left in India! The paths of knowledge, devotion, and Yoga — all have gone, and now there remains only that of Don&amp;rsquo;t touchism — &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me! Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me!&amp;rdquo; The whole world is impure, and I alone am pure. Lucid Brahmajnāna! Bravo!</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
We have no organisation, nor want to build any. Each one is quite independent to teach, quite free to preach whatever he or she likes.
If you have the spirit within, you will never fail to attract others. Theosophists&#39; method can never be ours, for the very simple reason that they are an organised sect, we are not.
Individuality is my motto. I have no ambition beyond training individuals up.</description>

DEAR BROTHER (To Dr. I. Janes.),
I was away in the Catskill mountains and it was almost impossible to get a letter regularly posted from where I was — so accept my apology for the delay in offering you my most heartfelt thanks for your letter in the &amp;ldquo;Eagle&amp;rdquo;.
It was so scholarly, truthful and noble and withal so permeated with your natural universal love for the good and true everywhere.</description>

From Gautam Chaudhuri
 CALCUTTA, Aug. 15 - Desperately seeking ways to make inroads into the minority vote bank in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has set up a core group of six Muslim leaders, who have been asked to concentrate on the minority pockets in UP before the forthcoming Assembly elections, in order to woo the Muslims to give bigger support to the BJP.</description>

Since writing to you my pupils have come round me with help, and the classes will go on nicely now no doubt.
I was so glad at it because teaching has become a part of my life, as necessary to my life as eating or breathing.

DEAR ALASINGA,
Last week I wrote you about the Brahmavādin. I forgot to write about the Bhakti lectures. They ought to be published in a book all together. A few hundreds may be sent to America to Goodyear in New York. Within twenty days I sail for England. I have other big books on Karma, Jnana, and Raja Yogas — the Karma is out already, the Raja will be a very big book and is already in the Press.</description>

In London once more. The climate now in England is nice and cool. We have fire in the grate. We have a whole house to ourselves, you know, this time. It is small but convenient, and in London they do not cost so much as in America. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know what I was thinking — about your mother!

This is the world my brother — this illusion of Māyā — the Lord alone is true. The forms are evanescent; but the spirit, being in the Lord and of the Lord, is immortal and omnipresent. All that we ever had are round us this minute, for the spirit can neither come nor go, it only changes its plane of manifestation.</description>

7th June, 1896.
DEAR MISS NOBLE,
My ideal indeed can be put into a few words and that is: to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.
This world is in chain of superstition. I pity the oppressed, whether man or woman, and I pity more the oppressors.
One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignorance and nothing else.</description>

DEEPALI NANDWANI
 The fiery Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is on a friendship mission. And the target is none other than its ‘erstwhile enemy’, the Muslim community.
The RSS functionaries, sources say, are now meeting Muslim leaders to ‘get itself rid of the fascist tag’ - just last week the top brass led by deputy general secretary K.</description>

I was very glad to receive your last report. I have very little criticism to make except that you ought to write a bit more legibly.
I am quite satisfied with the work done so far, but it must be pushed forward.

Excuse these few lines. I shall write more fully as soon as I reach some place. I am on my way from the hills to the plains.

A letter from Sturdy reached me yesterday, informing me that you are determined to come to India and see things with your own eyes. I replied to that yesterday, but what I learnt from Miss Muller about your plans makes this further note necessary, and it is better that it should be direct.

For the last few months I have been hearing so much of the luxuries I was given to enjoy by the people of the West — luxuries which the hypocrite myself has been enjoying, although preaching renunciation all the while: luxuries, the enjoyment of which has been the great stumbling-block in my way, in England at least.</description>

MY DEAR MRS. LEGGETT,
Many, many thanks for all your kindness and especially the kind note. I am going to start from Chicago on Thursday next, and got the ticket and berth ready for that day.
Miss Noble is doing very well here, and working her way out. I saw Alberta the other day. She is enjoying every minute of her stay here and is very happy.</description>

Nothing new — except Madame Calvé&amp;rsquo;s visit. She is a great woman. I wish I saw more of her. It is a grand sight to see a giant pine struggling against a cyclone. Is it not?
I leave here tonight. These lines in haste as A__ is waiting. Mrs. Adams is kind as usual. Margot doing splendidly. Will write more from California.</description>

DEAR MARGOT,
Your sixth has arrived, but with it yet no change in my fortune. Would change be any good, do you think? Some people are made that way, to love being miserable. If I did not break my heart over people I was born amongst, I would do it for somebody else. I am sure of that. This is the way of some, I am coming to see it.</description>

So glad to get your nice letter. Well, you may be sure I am keeping in touch with my friends. Yet a delay may sometimes cause nervousness.
Dr. and Mrs. Hiller returned to the city, much benefited, as they declare, by Mrs. Melton&amp;rsquo;s rubbings. As for me, I have got several huge red patches on my chest.</description>

Sudheendra Kulkarni on Muslims’ choice
 Two Prime Ministers, one present and the other his immediate predecessor, have last week made statements about Indian Muslims which, despite the sharp differences in their political ideologies, reveal a remarkable commonality of observation. H.D. Deve Gowda, in an interview given to a major Hindi daily, has stated that “the socio-economic conditions of Muslims in some parts of the country are worse than those of Dalits.</description>

Before I address you on the subject matter of discussion I think it advisable to state for your information that I have been a constant reader and admirer of your writings. From childhood, I was taught to respect the opinions and the teachings of the white-bearded Syed of Aligarh.</description>

The softest flower&amp;rsquo;s sweetest feel;
The charm and force that ever sway
The altar fire&amp;rsquo;s flaming play;

Far-reaching dreams, and patient ways,
Eternal faith in Self, in all
The sight Divine in great in small;

Om Tat Sat! To know the Om is to know the secret of the universe. The object of Jnāna-Yoga is the same as that of Bhakti and Rāja Yogas, but the method is different. This is the Yoga for the strong, for those who are neither mystical nor devotional, but rational.</description>

Jnāna teaches that the world should be given up, but not on that account to be abandoned. To be in the world, but not of it, is the true test of the Sannyāsin. This idea of renunciation has been in some form common to nearly all religions.</description>

Thought is all important, for &amp;ldquo;what we think we become&amp;rdquo;. There was once a Sannyāsin, a holy man, who sat under a tree and taught the people. He drank milk, and ate only fruit, and made endless &amp;ldquo;Prānāyāmas&amp;rdquo;, and felt himself to be very holy.</description>

Rāja-Yoga is as much a science as any in the world. It is an analysis of the mind, a gathering of the facts of the supersensuous world and so building up the spiritual world.</description>

This Yoga is known as the eightfold Yoga, because it is divided into eight principal parts. These are:
First — Yama. This is most important and has to govern the whole life; it has five divisions:</description>

22. J.K. Hindu exiles eulogise Thackeray
BY SUJATA ANANDAN
 MUMBAI, Sept. 24: As the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attempts to shrug off the Shiv Sena, which in recent days has become an albatross round its neck, it might find that it is losing ground to its ally where matters relating to the Hindu heart are concerned.
The BJP’s dilly-dallying over hardcore Hindutva issues has already earned it the ridicule of the extreme right of the Hindu fundamentalist forces.</description>

LETTER THREE
Well may we apply the opening sentence of Dickens&#39; Tale of Two Cities to the present times in India. Well may we say that it is &amp;ldquo;the best of times&amp;rdquo; as well as &amp;ldquo;the worst of times.&amp;rdquo; Best as the country is on the point of having a nation, worst as a particular section of the community wants to check the progress of the country; and unfortunately is headed, or at least is said to be headed, by a man who has been a frequent advocate of representative Government in India.</description>

      <description>WOMEN OF INDIA (Delivered at the Shakespeare Club House, in Pasadena, California, on January 18, 1900)
SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: &amp;ldquo;Some persons desire to ask questions about Hindu Philosophy before the lecture and to question in general about India after the lecture; but the chief difficulty is I do not know what I am to lecture on. I would be very glad to lecture on any subject, either on Hindu Philosophy or on anything concerning the race, its history, or its literature.</description>

Now, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for this morning was to have been the Vedanta Philosophy. That subject itself is interesting, but rather dry and very vast.
Meanwhile, I have been asked by your president and some of the ladies and gentlemen here to tell them something about my work and what I have been doing.</description>

      <description>BUDDHA&amp;rsquo;S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 18, 1900)
Buddhism is historically the most important religion — historically, not philosophically — because it was the most tremendous religious movement that the world ever saw, the most gigantic spiritual wave ever to burst upon human society. There is no civilisation on which its effect has not been felt in some way or other.
The followers of Buddha were most enthusiastic and very missionary in spirit.</description>

      <description>DISCIPLESHIP (Delivered in San Francisco, on March 29, 1900)
My subject is &amp;ldquo;Discipleship&amp;rdquo;. I do not know how you will take what I have to say. It will be rather difficult for you to accept it — the ideals of teachers and disciples in this country vary so much from those in ours. An old proverb of India comes to my mind: &amp;ldquo;There are hundreds of thousands of teachers, but it is hard to find one disciple.</description>

Those of you who have been attending my lectures for the last month or so must, by this time, be familiar with the ideas contained in the Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta is the most ancient religion of the world; but it can never be said to have become popular. Therefore the question &amp;ldquo;Is it going to be the religion of the future?</description>

      <description>STRUGGLE FOR EXPANSION (Written by the Swami during his first visit to America in answer to questions put by a Western disciple.)
The old dilemma, whether the tree precedes the seed or the seed the tree, runs through all our forms of knowledge. Whether intelligence is first in the order of being or matter; whether the ideal is first or the external manifestation; whether freedom is our true nature or bondage of law; whether thought creates matter or matter thought; whether the incessant change in nature precedes the idea of rest or the idea of rest precedes the idea of change — all these are questions of the same insoluble nature.</description>

Our main problem is to be free. It is evident then that until we realise ourselves as the Absolute, we cannot attain to deliverance. Yet there are various ways of attaining to this realisation. These methods have the generic name of Yoga (to join, to join ourselves to our reality).</description>

This whole universe is a case of lost balance. All motion is the struggle of the disturbed universe to regain its equilibrium, which, as such, cannot be motion. Thus in regard to the internal world it would be a state which is beyond thought, for thought itself is a motion.</description>

The Imitation of Christ is a cherished treasure of the Christian world. This great book was written by a Roman Catholic monk.</description>

23. Secularism is the very colour
of our blood: Vajpayee
Pankaj Sharma
 JAIPUR: BJP’s imminent strategy is going to be crystal clear now. Days to come would give the BJP a secular-socialist colour. BJP’s top leadership at a Jaipur meeting decided that initiatives would have to be taken to bring the Muslim community close to it at all costs, that a movement would have to be launched to fight corruption at every level, that the poor’s welfare oriented economic policies would have to be forcefully advocated, that a movement would have to be launched against foreign companies, and that a fight to the finish would have to be started against the forces retarding BJP’s march to power.</description>

These were nothing but a very strong letter which he wrote to her in vindication of his position on the 1st February, 1895, which will be found reproduced in the fifth volume of the Complete Works of the Swami.</description>

If things go ill or well —

Each one to weep or laugh as may;
Each one his dress to don —
Its scenes, alternative shine and rain.

      <description>TO AN EARLY VIOLET (Written to a Western lady-disciple from New York, 6th January 1896.)
What though thy bed be frozen earth,
Thy cloak the chilling blast;
What though no mate to cheer thy path,
Thy sky with gloom o&amp;rsquo;ercast;
What though if love itself doth fail,
Thy fragrance strewed in vain;
What though if bad o&amp;rsquo;er good prevail,
And vice o&amp;rsquo;er virtue reign:
Change not thy nature, gentle bloom,</description>

      <description>TO MY OWN SOUL (Composed at Ridgely Manor, New York, in 1899.)
Hold yet a while, Strong Heart,
Not part a lifelong yoke
Though blighted looks the present, future gloom.
And age it seems since you and I began our
March up hill or down. Sailing smooth o&amp;rsquo;er
Seas that are so rare —
Thou nearer unto me, than oft-times I myself —
Proclaiming mental moves before they were!
Reflector true — Thy pulse so timed to mine,</description>

      <description>THE DANCE OF SHIVA (Translated from a Hindi / Bengali song.)
Lo, the God is dancing
— Shiva the all-destroyer and Lord of creation,
The Master of Yoga and the wielder of Pināka. (Trident.)
His flaming locks have filled the sky,
Seven worlds play the rhythm
As the trembling earth sways almost to dissolution,
Lo, the Great God Shiva is dancing.</description>

      <description>SHIVA IN ECSTASY (Translated from a Bengali song.)
Shiva is dancing, lost in the ecstasy of Self, sounding his
own cheeks.
His tabor is playing and the garland of skulls is swinging
in rhythm.
The waters of the Ganga are roaring among his matted
locks.
The great trident is vomiting fire, and the moon on his
forehead is fiercely flaming.</description>

O Krishna, my friend, let me go to the water,

O friend, let me go today, let me go.
I have to fill my pitcher in the waters of the Jumna.
I pray with folded hands, friend, let me go.</description>

ॐ ह्रीं ऋतं त्वमचलो गुणजीत् गुणेड्यो
नक्तंदिवं सकरुणं तव पादपद्मम्।
मोहङ्कषं बहुकृतं न भजे यतोऽहं
तस्मात्त्वमेव शरणं मम दीनबन्धो ॥१॥
1. Om! Hrim! Thou art the True, the Imperturbable One, transcending the three Gunas and yet adored for Thy virtues! Inasmuch as I do not worship day and night, with yearning, Thy compassionate lotus feet which destroy all ignorance, therefore, O Thou friend of the lowly, Thou art my only refuge.</description>

24. A good augury
 Sir, - It is heartening to note that the Bharatiya Janata Party, of late, has realised its folly of isolating Muslims. In Kerala it is organising meetings in which intellectuals of both the communities exchange their views so as to remove the misunderstandings and misconceptions between them. In these conclaves, efforts are made to cultivate and establish healthy relationship between the two communities.</description>

      <description>NO ONE TO BLAME (Written from New York, 16th May, 1895.)
The sun goes down, its crimson rays
Light up the dying day;
A startled glance I throw behind
And count my triumph shame;
No one but me to blame.
Each day my life I make or mar,
Each deed begets its kind,
Good good, bad bad, the tide once set
No one can stop or stem;
No one but me to blame.</description>

      <description>NOTES OF CLASS TALKS WHEN WILL CHRIST COME AGAIN?
I never take much notice of these things. I have come to deal with principles. I have only to preach that God comes again and again, and that He came in India as Krishna, Rāma, and Buddha, and that He will come again. It can almost be demonstrated that after each 500 years the world sinks, and a tremendous spiritual wave comes, and on the top of the wave is a Christ.</description>

      <description>MAN THE MAKER OF HIS DESTINY There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalised and recorded and made into a huge book.</description>

      <description>GOD: PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL My idea is that what you call a Personal God is the same as the Impersonal Being, a Personal and Impersonal God at the same time. We are personalised impersonal beings. If you use the word in the absolute sense, we are impersonal; but if you use it in a relative meaning, we are personal. Each one of you is a universal being, each one is omnipresent.</description>

      <description>THE DIVINE INCARNATION OR AVATARA Jesus Christ was God — the Personal God become man. He has manifested Himself many times in different forms and these alone are what you can worship. God in His absolute nature is not to be worshipped. Worshipping such God would be nonsense. We have to worship Jesus Christ, the human manifestation, as God. You cannot worship anything higher than the manifestation of God. The sooner you give up the worship of God separate from Christ, the better for you.</description>

      <description>PRANAYAMA First of all we will try to understand a little of the meaning of Prānāyama. Prāna stands in metaphysics for the sum total of the energy that is in the universe. This universe, according to the theory of the philosophers, proceeds in the form of waves; it rises, and again it subsides, melts away, as it were; then again it proceeds out in all this variety; then again it slowly returns.</description>

Swami Vivekananda said, &amp;ldquo;All the words spoken at this parliament come to the common conclusion that the brotherhood of man is the much-to-be-desired end. Much has been said for this brotherhood as being a natural condition, since we are all children of one God. Now, there are sects that do not admit of the existence of God — that is, a Personal God.</description>

25. Muslims in Behrampada voted
in a pragmatic way
By Anil Singh
 MUMBAI: Simply put, it was gutter-level politics, quite literally, which helped the Shiv Sena win the civic seat from Behrampada. The Sena was the only party which got the drains cleaned and had toilets built for the women of this Muslim-dominated slum in Bandra east.
Apart from their work in the area, a host of other factors went into ensuring the Sena’s victory in the slum which witnessed some of the bloodiest communal riots in December 1992-January 1993.</description>

Vivekananda delivered a lecture on &amp;ldquo;The Love of God&amp;rdquo; at the Unitarian Church last night before the largest audience that he has yet had. The trend of the lecturer&amp;rsquo;s remarks was to show that we do not accept God because we really want Him, but because we have need of Him for selfish purposes.</description>

Of the different philosophies, the tendency of the Hindu is not to destroy, but to harmonise everything. If any new idea comes into India, we do not antagonise it, but simply try to take it in, to harmonise it, because this method was taught first by our prophet, God incarnate on earth, Shri Krishna.</description>

      <description>THE RELIGION OF LOVE (Notes of a lecture delivered in London on November 16, 1895)
Just as it is necessary for a man to go through symbols and ceremonies first in order to arrive at the depth of realisation, so we say in India, &amp;ldquo;It is good to be born in a church, but bad to die in one&amp;rdquo;. A sapling must be hedged about for protection, but when it becomes a tree, a hedge would be a hindrance.</description>

      <description>JNANA AND KARMA (Notes of a lecture delivered in London, on November 23, 1895)
The greatest force is derived from the power of thought. The finer the element, the more powerful it is. The silent power of thought influences people even at a distance, because mind is one as well as many. The universe is a cobweb; minds are spiders.
The universe equals the phenomena of one Universal Being. He, seen through our senses, is the universe.</description>

      <description>THE CLAIMS OF VEDANTA ON THE MODERN WORLD (Report of a lecture delivered in Oakland on Sunday, February 25, 1900, with
editorial comments of the Oakland Enquirer)
The announcement that Swami Vivekananda, a distinguished savant of the East, would expound the philosophy of Vedanta in the Parliament of Religions at the Unitarian Church last evening, attracted an immense throng. The main auditorium and ante-rooms were packed, the annexed auditorium of Wendte Hall was thrown open, and this was also filled to overflowing, and it is estimated that fully 500 persons, who could not obtain seats or standing room where they could hear conveniently, were turned away.</description>

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu philosopher, delivered another lecture in Wendte Hall last evening. His subject was: &amp;ldquo;The Reality and The Shadow&amp;rdquo;. He said:
&amp;ldquo;The soul of man is ever striving after certainty, to find something that does not change. It is never satisfied. Wealth, the gratification of ambition or of appetite are all changeable.</description>

 MUMBAI, MARCH 8 - Chief Minister Manohar Joshi’s assurance to a delegation of Catholic leaders, last month, has surprised Mangalprabhat Lodha, BJP MLA from Malabar Hill.
The issue is the Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill, introduced by Lodha as a private member’s Bill in the last Assembly session at Nagpur. The Bill seeks to make the use of force or allurement for religious conversion a cognisable offence in the State.</description>

PART 2 &amp;ndash; [The Unity Conference and the relativity of rights]
[A] In the discussions at tbe Unity Conference held at Delhi, one thing struck me very forcibly. That was the fact that so many of the ablest and most patriotic Muhammadan young men, as well as a few Hindus, were obsessed with the idea of &amp;ldquo;absolute rights.&amp;rdquo; Time after time it was said that the Muhammadans had an inherent right to slaughter cows, and that that right could only be curtailed by their own voluntary sacrifice.</description>

      <description>I AM THAT I AM (Notes of a lecture give in San Francisco on March 20, 1900)
The subject tonight is man, man in contrast with nature. For a long time the word &amp;ldquo;nature&amp;rdquo; was used almost exclusively to denote external phenomena. These phenomena were found to behave methodically; and they often repeated themselves: that which had happened in the past happened again — nothing happened only once. Thus it was concluded that nature was uniform.</description>

      <description>UNITY (Notes of a lecture delivered at the Vedanta Society, New York, in June, 1900)
The different sectarian systems of India all radiate from one central idea of unity or dualism.
They are all under Vedanta, all interpreted by it. Their final essence is the teaching of unity. This, which we see as many, is God. We perceive matter, the world, manifold sensation. Yet there is but one existence.
These various names mark only differences of degree in the expression of that One.</description>

      <description>THE WORSHIP OF THE DIVINE MOTHER (Fragmentary notes taken on a Sunday afternoon in New York in June, 1900)
From the tribal or clan-God, man arrives, in every religion, at the sum, the God of gods.
Confucius alone has expressed the one eternal idea of ethics. &amp;ldquo;Manu Deva&amp;rdquo; was transformed into Ahriman. In India, the mythological expression was suppressed; but the idea remained. In an old Veda is found the Mantra, &amp;ldquo;I am the empress of all that lives, the power in everything.</description>

In France the &amp;ldquo;rights of man&amp;rdquo; was long a watchword of the race; in America the rights of women still beseech the public ear; in India we have concerned ourselves always with the rights of Gods.
The Vedanta includes all sects. We have a peculiar idea in India. Suppose I had a child; I should not teach him any religion, but the practice of concentrating his mind; and just one line of prayer — not prayer in your sense, but this: &amp;ldquo;I meditate on Him who is the Creator of the universe; may He enlighten my mind.</description>

At the three-day in-camera proceedings of the VHP which concluded at Karsevakpuram here today, the front ranking leaders of the parishad abandoned programmes to launch movement to “liberate” the two shrines by taking possession of the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and the Shahi Mosque in Mathura which they consider encroachment upon the Lord Vishwanath Temple and Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple respectively.</description>

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai)
It is a long time since I heard from you. I hope I have not offended you anyway. I came down with the Thakore Saheb of Mahabaleshwar, and I am living here with him. I would remain here a week or more and then proceed to Rameshwaram via Hyderabad.</description>

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai)
The bearer of this letter, Babu Akshaya Kumar Ghose, is a particular friend of mine. He comes of a respectable family of Calcutta. I found him at Khandwa where I made his acquaintance, although I knew his family long before in Calcutta.
He is a very honest and intelligent boy and is an undergraduate of the Calcutta University. You know how hard the struggle is in Bengal nowadays, and the poor boy has been out in search of some job.</description>

I am very much gratified on receiving your letter, especially as that is the proof that you have the same kindness towards me.
About the kindness and gentlemanliness of your friend Mr. Bederkar of Indore and of the Dakshinis in general, the less said the better; but of course there are Dakshinis and Dakshinis, and I would only quote to you what Shankar Pandurang wrote me at Mahabaleshwar on my informing him that I had found shelter with the Limdi Thakore:</description>

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB,
On my way here, I wanted to go to your place at Nadiad and redeem my pledge, but certain circumstances prevented me, and the greatest of them was that you were not there; and to play Hamlet leaving Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s part out is a ridiculous affair; and as I know for certain that you are to return in a few days to Nadiad, and as I am shortly going back to Bombay, say in 20 days, I thought it better to postpone my visit for that time.</description>

May, 1893.
DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB,
Surely my letter had not reached you before you wrote to me. The perusal of your letter gave me both pleasure and pain simultaneously: pleasure, to see that I have the good fortune to be loved by a man of your heart, power, and position; and pain, to see that my motive has been misinterpreted throughout. Believe me, that I love you and respect you like a father and that my gratitude towards you and your family is surely unbounded.</description>

Are the Hindu and Muhammadan religions and cultures so fundamentally different, or to be more exact, so antagonistic, as to make their followers naturally and instinctively hostile to each other?</description>

DEAR__ ,
The other day I received a letter from G. G., Mysore. G. G. unfortunately thinks that I am all-knowing, else he would have written his Canarese address on the top of the letter more legibly. Then again it is a great mistake to address me letters to any other place but Chicago. It was my mistake of course at first, because I ought to have thought of the fine Buddhi (intellect) of our friends who are throwing letters at me anywhere they find an address at the top.</description>

Communal Award by His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Government÷1932
In the statement made by the Prime Minister on 1st December last on behalf of His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Government at the close of the second session of the Round Table Conference, which was immediately afterwards endorsed by both Houses of Parliament, it was made plain that if the communities in India were unable to reach a settlement acceptable to all parties on the communal questions which the Conference had failed to solve, His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Government were determined that India&amp;rsquo;s constitutional advance should not on that account be frustrated, and that they would remove this obstacle by devising and applying themselves a provisional scheme.</description>

One Chicago lady, Mrs. Pratt of Kenilworth, wanted to give me $500; she became so much interested in me; but I refused. She has made me promise that I would send word to her whenever I need money, which I hope the Lord will never put me in.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
The letter from the Madras people was published in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Boston Transcript. I hope to send you a copy. You may have seen it in some Chicago paper. I am sure there is some mail for me at Cook &amp;amp; Sons — I shall be here till Tuesday next at least, on which day I am going to lecture here in Annisquam.</description>

XXVII To Mr. Leon Landsberg
HOTEL BELLEVUE,

DEAR LEON,
Forgive me, but I have the right, as your Guru, to advise you, and I insist that you buy some clothes for yourself, as the want of them stands in the way of your doing anything in this country. Once you have a start, you may dress in whatever way you like. People do not object.</description>

HOTEL BELLEVUE,
BEACON ST., BOSTON,
13th September, 1894.
DEAR SISTER,
Your kind note reached me this morning. I have been in this hotel for about a week. I will remain in Boston some time yet. I have plenty of gowns already, in fact, more than I can carry with ease. When I had that drenching in Annisquam, I had on that beautiful black suit you appreciate so much, and I do not think it can be damaged any way; it also has been penetrated with my deep meditations on the Absolute.</description>

      <description>XXIX CHICAGO,
September, 1894.
DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),
Your kind letter reached long ago, but as I had not anything to write I was late in answering.
Your kind note to G. W. Hale has been very gratifying, as I owed them that much. I have been travelling all over this country all this time and seeing everything. I have come to this conclusion that there is only one country in the world which understands religion — it is India; that with all their faults the Hindus are head and shoulders above all other nations in morality and spirituality; and that with proper care and attempt and struggle of all her disinterested sons, by combining some of the active and heroic elements of the West with the calm virtues of the Hindus, there will come a type of men far superior to any that have ever been in this world.</description>

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),
Very kind of you to send up a man inquiring about my health and comfort. But that&amp;rsquo;s quite of a piece with your fatherly character. I am all right here. Your kindness has left nothing more to be desired here. I hope soon to see you in a few days. I don&amp;rsquo;t require any conveyance while going down. Descent is very bad, and the ascent is the worst part of the job, that&amp;rsquo;s the same in everything in the world.</description>

at BJP Muslim meeting
Express News Service
 NEW DELHI, JUNE 7 - A MISUNDERSTANDING between firebrand BJP leader Uma Bharati and her senior Sikander Bakht over “Vande Mataram” created a flutter at the National Muslim Youth Convention organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha here today.
In a departure from BJP tradition, the convention did not begin with the national song, inviting Bakht’s wrath.</description>

Supplementary Communal Award/1/
&amp;ldquo;Then there was the question of the representation of communities in the Centre, particularly of the Muslim community. There, I think, I can say definitely÷1 think I have said it indirectly very often before ÷ that the Government consider that the Muslim community should have a representation 33 1/3 percent in the Federal Centre. As far as Indian India is concerned that must be a matter for arrangement between the communities affected and the princes, but, so far as the British Government has any part in the question we will, at any time, give our good offices to making it as easy as possible for the arrangement between those parties with regard to the future allocation of seats.</description>

Your letter pleased me extremely. I, of course, understand the joke, but I am not the baby to be put off with a joke; now take more.
The secret of success of the Westerners is the power of organisation and combination. That is only possible with mutual trust and co-operation and help. Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain, whom you well knew in Bombay. This man never takes anything but pure vegetables even in this terribly cold climate, and tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and religion.</description>

DEAR FRIEND,
I am perfectly aware that although some truth underlies the mass of mystical thought which has burst upon the Western world of late, it is for the most part full of motives, unworthy, or insane. For this reason, I have never had anything to do with these phases of religion, either in India or elsewhere, and mystics as a class are not very favourable to me.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Truth alone triumphs, not untruth. Through truth alone lies the way to Devayāna (the way to the gods).&amp;rdquo; Those who think that a little sugar-coating of untruth helps the spread of truth are mistaken and will find in the long run that a single drop of poison poisons the whole mass.</description>

What I expected has come. I always thought that although Prof. Max Muller in all his writings on the Hindu religion adds in the last a derogatory remark, he must see the whole truth in the long run. As soon as you can, get a copy of his last book Vedantism; there you will find him swallowing the whole of it — reincarnation and all.</description>

Mr. Leggett told me of your phonograph. I told him to get a few cylinders — I talk in them through somebody&amp;rsquo;s phonograph and send them to Joe — to which he replied that he could buy one, because &amp;ldquo;I always do what Joe asks me to do.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
The letters from India and the parcel of books reached me safe. I am so happy to know of Mr. Sam&amp;rsquo;s arrival. I am sure he is &amp;ldquo;bewaring of the vidders&amp;rdquo; nicely. I met a friend of Mr. Sam&amp;rsquo;s one day on the street. He is an Englishman with a name ending in &amp;ldquo;ni&amp;rdquo;. He was very nice.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
Many thanks for the Indian mail. It brought a good deal of good news. You are enjoying by this time, I hope, the articles by Prof. Max Müller on the &amp;ldquo;Immortality of the Soul&amp;rdquo; which I sent to Mother Church. The old man has taken in Vedanta, bones and all, and has boldly come out.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
Many thanks for the Indian mail. I cannot express in words my gratitude to you. As you have already read in Max Müller&amp;rsquo;s article on Immortality I sent Mother Church, that he thinks that those we love in this life we must have loved in the past, so it seems I must have belonged to the Holy Family in some past life.</description>

Your kind note received today. I am going to Paris first with a friend and start for Europe on the 17th of August. I will however remain in Paris only a week to see my friend married, and then I go over to London.
Your advice about an organisation was very good indeed. And I am trying to act on that line.</description>

DEAR FRIEND,
. . . It is only just that I should try to give you a little of my views. I fully believe that there are periodic ferments of religion in human society, and that such a period is now sweeping over the educated world. While each ferment, moreover, appears broken into various little bubbles, these are all eventually similar, showing the cause or causes behind them to be the same.</description>

It is useless to express my gratitude for your kindness; it is too great for expression. . . .

DEAR JOE JOE,
A thousand pardons for not promptly writing to you. I arrived safe in London, found my friend, and am all right in his home. It is beautiful. His wife is surely an angel, and his life is full of India. He has been years there — mixing with the Sannyasins, eating their food, etc.</description>

 On account of the Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, refugees moved from Pakistan, without much interruption, to various parts of India, especially to West Bengal, till 1971, when political boundaries in South Asia were redrawn. Even after the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971, however, the march of refugees to West Bengal appeared to be ceaseless.</description>

[A] Add to this the Fatwa of the Ulemas that India being a &amp;ldquo;Dar­ul-Harab&amp;rdquo; (a place of war), every good Muslim ought to leave it and migrate to a Muslim country. We know by this time how the Hijrat movement ended; how much money was wasted over it and how much misery was wrought thereby. The best commentary on it was witnessed by me at Constantinople.</description>

Just now two young gentlemen, Mr. Silverlock and his friend, left. Miss Müller also came this afternoon and left just when these gentlemen came in.
One is an Engineer and the other is in the grain trade. They have read a good deal of modern philosophy and science and have been much struck by the similarity with the latest conclusions of both with the ancient Hindu thought.</description>

DEAR SHARAT,
Your letter only made me sad. I see you have lost all enthusiasm. I know all of you, your powers and your limitations. I would not have called you to any task which you are incompetent to do. The only task I would have given you was to teach elementary Sanskrit, and with the help of dictionaries and other things assist S.</description>

RIDGELY MANOR,
29th December, 1895.
DEAR FRIEND,
By this time the copies of the lectures must have reached you. Hope they may be of some use.
I think, in the first place, there are so many difficulties to overcome; in the second place, they think that they are fit for nothing — that is the national disease; thirdly, they are afraid to face the winter at once; the Tibet man they don&amp;rsquo;t think is a very strong man to work in England.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
Many thanks for your kind New Year&amp;rsquo;s greetings. I am glad to learn you enjoyed your six weeks with the Esq. although they be only golf playing. I have been in the midst of the genuine article in England. The English people received me with open arms, and I have very much toned down my ideas about the English race.</description>

BLESSED AND BELOVED,
Many many thanks for the books. The Sankhya Karika is a very good book, and the Kurma Purana, though I do not find in it all expected, has a few verses on Yoga. The words dropped in my last letter were Yoga-Sutra, which I am translating with notes from various authorities. I want to incorporate the chapter in Kurma Purana in my notes.</description>

DEAR ALASINGA,
By this time you must have got enough of matter on Bhakti from me. The last copy, dated 21st December, of Brahmavadin is in. I have been smelling something since the last few issues of the Brahmavadin. Are you going to join the Theosophists? This time you simply gave yourselves up. Why, you get in a notice of the Theosophists&#39; lectures in the body of your notes!</description>

I am coming before May if possible. You need not worry about that. The pamphlet was beautiful. The newspaper cuttings from here will be forwarded if we can get them.
The books and pamphlets here have been got up this way. A committee was formed in New York. They paid all the expenses of stenographing and printing on condition the books will belong to them.</description>

I received your last just now and it frightened me immensely.
The lectures were delivered under the auspices of certain friends who paid for the stenography and all other expenses on condition they alone will have the right to publish them. As such, they have already published the Sunday lectures as well as three books on &amp;ldquo;Karma-Yoga&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raja-Yoga&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Jnana-Yoga&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
I am afraid you are offended and did not answer any of my letters. Now I beg a hundred thousand pardons. By very good luck, I have found the orange cloth and am going to have a coat made as soon as I can. I am glad to hear you met Mrs. Bull. She is such a noble lady and kind friend.

Government of India Resolution of 1934 on Communal Representation of Minorities in the Services/1/
the 4th July 1934
SECTION I÷GENERAL
No. F. 14/17-B./33.÷In accordance with undertakings given in the Legislative Assembly the Government of India have carefully reviewed the results of the policy followed since 1925 of reserving a certain percentage of direct appointments to Government service for the redress of communal inequalities. It has been represented that though this policy was adopted mainly with the object of securing increased representation for Muslims in the public services, it has failed to secure for them their due share of appointments and it has been contended that this position cannot be remedied unless a fixed percentage of vacancies is reserved for Muslims.</description>

[B] This is an appropriate place for examining the origin and bearings of the Shuddhi movement of which we have heard so much of late. The movement is as old as the Arya Samaj or even the Sikh religion.</description>

Greetings to you from the other shore. The voyage has been pleasant and no sickness this time. I gave myself treatment to avoid it.

DEAR MARY,
Your letter reached just now. Of course, you were not jealous but all of a sudden were inspired with sympathy for poor India. Well, you need not be frightened. Wrote a letter to Mother Church weeks ago, but have not been able to get a line from her yet. I am afraid the whole party have taken orders and entered a Catholic convent — four old maids are enough to drive any mother to a convent.</description>

LXXX To Kripananda
SWITZERLAND,
August, 1896.
DEAR—,
Be you holy and, above all, sincere; and do not for a moment give up your trust in the Lord, and you will see the light. Whatever is truth will remain for ever; whatever is not, none can preserve. We are helped in being born in a time when everything is quickly searched out. Whatever others think or do, lower not your standard of purity, morality, and love of God; above all, beware of all secret organisations.</description>

I am now taking rest. I read from different letters a lot about Kripananda. I am sorry for him. There must be something wrong in his head. Let him alone. None of you need bother about him.
As for hurting me, that is not in the power of gods or devils. So be at rest. It is unswerving love and perfect unselfishness that conquer everything.</description>

DEAR FRIEND,
I have at last seen Prof. Deussen. . . . The whole of yesterday was spent very nicely with the Professor, sight-seeing and discussing about the Vedanta.
He is what I should call &amp;ldquo;a warring Advaitist&amp;rdquo;. No compromise with anything else. &amp;ldquo;Ishwara&amp;rdquo; is his bug-bear. He would have none of it if he could. He is very much delighted with the idea of your magazine and wants to confer with you on these subjects in London, where he is shortly going.</description>

DEAR SISTER,
Today I reached London, after my two months of climbing and walking and glacier seeing in Switzerland. One good it has done me — a few pounds of unnecessary adipose tissue have returned back to the gaseous state. Well, there is no safety even in that, for the solid body of this birth has taken a fancy to outstrip the mind towards infinite expansion.</description>

LONDON,
3rd December, 1896.
DEAR JOE,
Many, many thanks, dear Joe Joe, for your kind invitation; but the Dear God has disposed it this way, viz I am to start for India on the 16th with Captain and Mrs. Sevier and Mr. Goodwin. The Seviers and myself take steamer at Naples. And as there will be four days at Rome, I will look in to say good-bye to Alberta.</description>

DEAR RAKHAL,
As you see, by this time I am on my way. Before leaving London, I got your letter and the pamphlet. Take no heed of Mazoomdar&amp;rsquo;s madness. He surely has gone crazy with jealousy. Such foul language as he has used would only make people laugh at him in a civilised country. He has defeated his purpose by the use of such vulgar words.</description>

DEAR MARY,
I received your letter forwarded from London in Rome. It was very very kind of you to write such a beautiful letter, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I do not know anything about the evolution of the orchestra in Europe. We are nearing Port Said after four days of frightfully bad sailing from Naples. The ship is rolling as hard as she can, and you must pardon my scrawls under such circumstances.</description>

DEAR RAKHAL,
I am to start by S.S. Mombasa next Sunday. I had to give up invitations from Poona and other places on account of bad health. I am very much pulled down by hard work and heat.
The Theosophists and others wanted to intimidate me. Therefore I had to give them a bit of my mind. You know they persecuted me all the time in America, because I did not join them.</description>

All of you have doubtless reached Madras by this time. I should think Biligiri is certainly taking great care of you, and that Sadananda serves you as your attendant. In Madras the worship should be done in a completely Sattvic manner, without a trace of Rajas in it. I hope Alasinga has by now returned to Madras.</description>

MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,
Your very very kind, loving, and encouraging letter gave me more strength than you think of.
There are moments when one feels entirely despondent, no doubt — especially when one has worked towards an ideal during a whole life&amp;rsquo;s time and just when there is a bit of hope of seeing it partially accomplished, there comes a tremendous thwarting blow.</description>

From your letter I got all the important news. I got a letter from Sudhir also and also one from Master Mahashay. I have also got two letters from Nityananda (Yogen Chatterjee) from the famine areas.
Even now money is floating on the waters, as it were, . . . but it will surely come. When it comes, buildings, land, and a permanent fund — everything will come all right.</description>

DEAR SUDHIR,
Your letter gave me much pleasure. One thing, perhaps, I forget to tell you — to keep a copy of the letter you sent me. Also all important communications to the Math from different persons and to different persons should be copied and preserved.
I am very glad to learn that things are going on well, that the work there is steadily progressing as well as that of Calcutta.</description>

If the Hindus occupy a larger number of posts under the Government than they would be entitled to on a purely numerical basis, they are not to be blamed for it.</description>

DEAR MARIE,
I begin here my promised big chatty letter with the best intention as to its growth, and if it fails, it will be owing to your own Karma. I am sure you are enjoying splendid health. I have been very, very bad indeed; now recovering a bit — hope to recover very soon.
What about the work in London?</description>

MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,
I am being played upon curiously by both good and evil influences from London these times here. . . . On the other hand, your letters are full of life and sunshine, and bring strength and hope to my spirits, and they sadly want these now. God knows.
Although I am still in the Himalayas, and shall be here for at least a month more, I started the work in Calcutta before I came, and they write progress every week.</description>

SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,
30th September, 1897
MY DEAR SHASHI,
Now I am returning from a visit to places in Kashmir. In a day or two I shall leave for the Punjab. As my health is now much better, I have decided to tour again in the same way as before. Not too much lecturing — one or two lectures, perhaps, in the Punjab, otherwise none.</description>

SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,
30th September, 1897
DEAR RAKHAL,
I understand from a letter of Gopal Dada that you have seen that piece of land at Konnagar. It seems that that site is rent-free and measures 16 bighas (about 5 acres), and that the price is below eight or ten thousand rupees. Do what you think best after considering the healthiness and other factors. In a day or two I shall leave for the Punjab.</description>

      <description>CX To Sister Nivedita
SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,
1st October, 1897.
DEAR MARGO,
Some people do the best work when led. Not every one is born to lead. The best leader, however, is one who &amp;ldquo;leads like the baby&amp;rdquo;. The baby, though apparently depending on everyone, is the king of the household. At least, to my thinking, that is the secret. . . . Many feel, but only a few can express. It is the power of expressing one&amp;rsquo;s love and appreciation and sympathy for others, that enables one person to succeed better in spreading the idea than others.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
I feel I have been working as if under an irresistible impulse for the last ten days, beginning from Kashmir. It may be either a physical or a mental disease. Now I have come to the conclusion that I am unfit for further work. . . . I now understand that I have been very harsh to all of you.</description>

MURREE,
12th October, 1897.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
I wrote at length in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s letter. I think it desirable to give you special directions about certain matters. . . . (1) To all those who collect money and send it to the Math . . . the acknowledgment of the amounts will be issued from the Math. (2) The acknowledgment must be in duplicate, one for the sender, and one for filing in the Math.</description>

JAMMU,
3rd November, 1897.
MY DEAR MISS NOBLE, (This was the last letter received in England by Sister Nivedita.)
. . . Too much sentiment hurts work. &amp;ldquo;Hard as steel and soft as a flower&amp;rdquo; is the motto.
I shall soon write to Sturdy. He is right to tell you that in case of trouble I will stand by you. You will have the whole of it if I find a piece of bread in India — you may rest assured of that.</description>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,
The lecture at Lahore is over somehow. I shall start for Dehra Dun in a day or two. I have now postponed my tour to Sind, as none of you are agreeable to it, and also because of various other obstacles. Somebody has opened my two letters from England on the way.

We shall start for Khetri tomorrow. Gradually the luggage has greatly increased. After Khetri I intend to send everybody to the Math. I could get done through them none of the work which I had hoped.

To Swami Brahmananda
SRINAGAR,
17th July, 1898.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
I got all the news from your letter. . . . My opinion regarding what you have written about Sarada is only that it is difficult to make a magazine in Bengali paying; but if all of you together canvass subscribers from door to door, it may be possible. In this matter do as you all decide.</description>

To Swami Brahmananda
SRINAGAR,
1st August, 1898.
MY DEAR RAKHAL,
You are always under a delusion, and it does not leave you because of the strong influence, good or bad, of other brains. It is this: whenever I write to you about accounts, you feel that I have no confidence in you. . . . My great anxiety is this: the work has somehow been started, but it should go on and progress even when we are not here; such thoughts worry me day and night.</description>

      <description>CXXXII To Miss Mary Hale
SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,
28th August, 1898.
MY DEAR MARY,
I could not make an earlier opportunity of writing you, and knowing that you were in no hurry for a letter, I will not make apologies. You are learning all about Kashmir and ourselves from Miss MacLeod&amp;rsquo;s letter to Mrs. Leggett, I hear — therefore needless going into long rigmaroles about it.
The search for Heinsholdt&amp;rsquo;s Mahatmas in Kashmir will be entirely fruitless; and as the whole thing has first to be established as coming from a creditable source, the attempt will also be a little too early.</description>

DEAR HARIPADA,
I got all news from your letter and wire. That you may easily pass your examination in Sindhi is my prayer to the Lord.
Recently my health was very bad, and so I have been delayed, otherwise I had intended to leave for the Punjab this week. The doctor had advised me not to go to the plains at the present time, as it is very hot there.</description>

MY DEAR MARY,
Thanks to Mrs. Adams; she roused you naughty girls to a letter at last. &amp;ldquo;Out of sight out of mind&amp;rdquo; — as true in India as in America. And the other young lady, who just left her love as she flitted by, deserves a ducking I suppose.
Well, I have been in a sort of merry-go-round with my body which has been trying to convince me for months that it too much exists.</description>

M. Nobel writes to me to defer my visit to him at Paris to some other date, from London, as he will have to be away for a long time. As you know sure, I shall not have many friends staying now in London, and Miss MacLeod is so desirous I should come.</description>

MY DEAR JOE,
We are in at last. Turiyananda and I have beautiful lodgings here. Saradananda&amp;rsquo;s brother is with Miss Noble and starts Monday next.
I have recovered quite a bit by the voyage. It was brought about by the exercise on the dumb-bells and monsoon storms tumbling the steamer about the waves. Queer, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Hope it will remain.</description>

MY DEAR MARIE,
I am in London again. This time not busy, not hustling about but quietly settled down in a corner — waiting to start for the U.S. America on the first opportunity. My friends are nearly all out of London in the country and elsewhere, and my health not sufficiently strong.
So you are happy in the midst of your lakes and gardens and seclusion in Canada.</description>

I have simply been taking rest at the Leggetts&#39; and doing nothing. Abhedananda is here. He has been working hard.
He goes in a day or two to resume his work in different places for a month. After that he comes to New York to work.
I am trying to do something in the line you suggested, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how far an account of the Hindus will be appreciated by the Western public when it comes from a Hindu.</description>

      <description>Horse Range  Range depended on breed, the weight of the rider (and armor), and many other factors, such as environmental conditions. Mongol ponies, for instance, were bred for stamina - i.e., traveling long hours and distances at a steady pace. The scrappy little Indian-bred horses used by the far-ranging Maratha cavalry in India were similarly bred for long-haul stamina. Infantry could cover at most 30 km per day. Mongols often used multiple (3/4) horses per rider, and stored meat between saddle and the horse to each on horseback.</description>

      <description>Problems with Science  Medieval History  The renaissance spirit owes a lot to the pagan revivalist Plethon, whose school was unfortunately subverted. In the Middle Ages, the view that the Book of Nature and the Book of Scripture must be harmonious (because they have the same &amp;ldquo;author&amp;rdquo;) led to non-literal interpretations of scripture to conform to empirical data. [??]  William of Conch (1100-1154) said: &amp;ldquo;Since the same earth, water and heat continue to exist today, there is no natural reason why new human races are not produced naturally from their interaction.</description>

Once the transfer of knowledge complete, the former disciple, or/and his/her followers progressively erase all traces of the original source, repackages the ideas as their own thought, and may even proceed to denigrate the source tradition. In the final stage, the ideas are exported back to India by the former disciple and/or his followers for consumption.</description>

      <description>Arab superiority Although the Prophet said all were equal before Allah, founders of 3/4 sunni madhabs explicitly mentioned superiority of Arabs. Even Zaydi Shias give them the same special privileges.
-Sayyids (plural Sadah) (descendants of the Prophet) -Quraysh (the tribe the prophet was from) -other Arabs -non Arabs
Only Maliki school doesn&amp;rsquo;t preach Arab superiority.
Marriage restrictions &amp;ldquo;Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali school said that mawla (non Arabs) men are unsuitable to marry Arab women.</description>

      <description>From divodAsa:
 After the fall of Marakkars, the Arakkal Ali Rajas of Kannur followed the same path. Ali Rajas of Arakkal were converts from a line of the Hindu Kolathiri Rajas of north Malabar. There are many folklore associated with them in North Malabar. They gained royal status via association with Kolathiris. But later they betrayed the Hindus of Malabar and began to claim superiority over Hindu kings by allying with Hyder Ali of Mysore [6]</description>

      <description>War  &amp;ldquo;Even from Agatangeghos&#39; account it is clear that the triumph of this new force was assured only after a decisive period during which Gregory the Illuminator &amp;ldquo;relied on the King&amp;rsquo;s terror and instruction to secure obedience from all&amp;rdquo; (p443). Preaching meekness and mildness to his flock Gregory the Illuminator and his allies did not consider such virtues appropriate to their own proselytising work. In the Christian conversion force and war clearly played a role immensely more important than the preaching of the priests!</description>

In 1980s and 1990s, not everybody in Punjab had television sets. People used to gather outside shops to watch the serial Mahabharata based on the great Hindu epic. The Khalistani radicals used to bomb. Another day, another set of people watching the TV serial Mahabharata was bombed by Khalistani radicals.</description>

      <description>Appropriation of texts and traditions  Johannes Bronkhorst: &amp;ldquo;There are no ancient texts that “belong” in any essential sense to the tradition that identifies with it. The Mahabharata “belongs” as little to modern Hindus as the Bible “belongs” to modern Christians. Historical scholarship cannot be steered by modern groups that have appropriated the texts they are studying.&amp;rdquo; The abrahamist scaffolding may be nearly impossible to completely overcome.

      <description>The BJP has grown out of the Golwalkar worldview, and in theory it swears by the “integral humanism” of Deendayal Upadhyaya (ca. 1965). Of this system, the name is the most important thing, as it amounts to a modern reformulation of the word Dharma. However, the party’s undeniable evolution, while modernizing its economic views and its PR, has mostly meant its growing away from ideology altogether.  History  In 1922, the Hindu Mahasabha was created as a guardian of Hindu interests.</description>

      <description>Reaction to WSJ anti-brahmin op-ed  I write today on behalf of the Hindu community to express our outrage regarding WSJ’s Op-Ed,titled “Canceling Student Debt Will Be a Brahmin Bailout” (Nov. 29th, 2020) by Mr. Zaid Jilani. It is a telling sign of our times that an Op-Ed lacking erudition and factual accuracy while reinforcing Hinduphobia and stereotypes of Hindus, is part of a newspaper such as the WSJ. The callous usage of the word “Brahmin” amounts to blatant propaganda and a thinly veiled attack on the Hindu community and will promote hatred and animosity towards Hindus in the United States and worldwide.</description>

      <description>Consolidation and propaganda in the Andamans In the first part of this narrative I have given an account, not of prisoner&amp;rsquo;s life and condition only but mainly that of the political convicts in the prison-house of the Andamans. The Story is brought down to the year 1914, The struggle, the courage, the tenacity of will, and the fight for principle of the political prisoners during the period, had their effect on other Hindu prisoners in that jail and had instilled into them the spirit of social and cooperative endeavour.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Shuddhi&amp;rdquo; movement in the Andamans
I was sent to the Andamans in 1911, and I soon found out that some Hindu prisoners had been converted to Islam and assumed Muslim names after their transportation to the Andamans. And when I traced the genesis of this change, I found that the Hindus in that place never found it worth while to think of, and took it as a matter of course.</description>

      <description>While climbing up to my cell in the Byculla prison I felt that I had to go one step higher in solitariness and dejection. For the cell here was more gloomy and far lonelier than the one I had occupied at Dongri. At Dongri I had no other person near about me, but the noise of the outer world fell upon my ears. I had, besides, a book or two to read, and some sundry articles about me.</description>

      <description>The World War (1914) and its menace to the Andamans The reader must have gathered from the first Chapter of this section, how, we, political prisoners, were handicapped for news from India, and how, later on, that is, after my transportation to the Silver Jail, matters became easier for us to procure news from India and circulate it in the Andamans. Officers like Mr. Barrie spread among us canards from India to harass and frighten us at the start of our prison-life here, whereas after two years we gave him the correct news about the position in India, so that faked news found no soil to take root in these islands since that date onwards.</description>

      <description>On The Way The portion of the prison-house reserved for the chalan&amp;rsquo;s confinement in the gaol at Thana, was to me like crossing the threshold and entering the precincts ofthe Andamans. The room in which I was locked up in that outlying part of the gaol, though a solitary cell, was within hearing of the rooms occupied by the prisoners in die Chalan. I could hear from my room the noise they created, the sighs they heaved, their wails, their talks and their good cheer, clearly enough to divert me from the long loneliness of my own cell.</description>

      <description>Political prisoners again flood the Andamans! While these manoeuverings ofthe German submarine in the waters of the Andamans were in progress to attack the islands, I happened to receive a press-cutting from a friend which contained the heading &amp;ldquo;Mutiny at Meerut&amp;rdquo;, This cutting was thrown into my cell by a political prisoner employed as a writer in the office below.
About the month of May last, a plot was discovered in India to start a revolution with an army at Meerut rising in mutiny against the Government.</description>

      <description>The spread of Hindi in the Andamans I had begun my work to obtain for Hindi the status of the national language of India, and to popularise it by every means at my disposal from the year 1906 when I was in England. The members of the Abhinav Bharata in England repeated the pledge every night before they retired for sleep, lo &amp;lsquo;make India independent to weld her into one nation, to turn her into a republic, and last and the fourth, to make Hindi the national language of India and Devanagari the script in which it should be written.</description>

      <description>The Cult of the Bomb The first batch of political prisoners sent to the Andamans consisted of Bengalis involved in the Manik Tola Bomb Case, and two gentlemen from Maharashtra, namely Mr. Ganesh Savarkar and Mr. Wamanrao Joshi. Soon after them came another batch of six persons from Bengal implicated in the trial for political dacoity. Of all these, three from Bengal and two from Maharashtra happened to be sentenced to transportation for life.</description>

      <description>The Black Sea They took me on the ladder and put me in the ground-floor of that steamer. A portion with strong iron bars was set apart in that place, no better than a long and narrow cage to accommodate twenty or thirty of us, in which were to be huddled prisoners on transportation at least fifty in number. We were no better there than cattle huddled up on board the steamer.</description>

      <description>The Fourth Strike and my ill-health The misfortune to which I have referred at the end of the last chapter happened thus. There was a political prisoner among us by name Bhan Singh. He was a Sikh, and for skirmishing with his tindal and the petty officer, he was locked up in the cell and Mr. Barrie was sent for by the tindal and the petty officer combined. Mr. Barrie entered the cell and abused him, and the Sikh prisoner returned abuse for abuse.</description>

      <description>The Andamans The group of islands, including the Andamans and the Nicobars, constitute a link not only with the past history of India but also with her development in the world of tomorrow. As such no Indian can afford to be ignorant about this group of islands. India of today is bound to have cultural contacts with other parts of the world; and the Andamans are a part of it that she is bound to influence.</description>

      <description>On Death-Bed While all these activities were carried on with zest during the later years of the war, I found my health completely shattered, as I wrote in the letter I had sent to my brother; and I was removed to the Hospital for rest and treatment. When my fever was ever hundred degrees on my body, and the dysentery had become very acute, the hospital Authorities began to attend to me with greater care and undertook regular treatment of my disease.</description>

      <description>We reach Andamans Our steamer had entered the port of the Andamans and her anchor was cast with ringing chain into its waters. She had stopped, and boats and officers&#39; launches were seen gathering around her to remove the prisoners. We had to wait for a long time before we were let down into the boats. I cast a glance around me to survey the place where I was to pass the rest of my life.</description>

      <description>Riots in Punjab and Gujarat. (1919-1920) The war had ended and its reaction on India was just coming to a close, when news came in the Andamans about riots in Punjab and Gujarat. We were taken by surprise to read that news. In the tremendous upheaval of the great war and its repercussion on the world, nothing cataclysmic could happen in India. And now these riots - on a day after the fair, an uprising of sleepers awakened and struggling for commotion, after the tide had turned!</description>

      <description>The First Week in my cell The Jamadar led me to Chawl No. 7. On the way lay a big reservoir of water. The Jamadar asked me to take my bath there. I had not taken my bath for four or five days. My body was full of sweat and dirt. The sea-voyage had done it. I was delighted with the permission to bathe. But I had no garment to change.</description>

      <description>Amnesty and political prisoners The Jail Commission had left the Andamans. There was no doubt in my mind that the members of the Commission were considerably impressed by the statement I had submitted, and the discussion I had with them. And I have reason to believe that they did not suggest my release because, though I had plainly put it to them that if the new reforms proved a success the revolutionaries would follow the path of peace, I had introduced many ifs and but&amp;rsquo;s to qualify that general proposition, and they were angered by them.</description>

      <description>I see my elder brother Myself and my elder brother were in the same jail, and we had not seen each other yet. His heart received a shock to know that I was here. And the news ofhis sufferings had wrung my heart. But a day came to prove unto me that these happenings in the past were almost nothing in our experience of life. Joy is scarcely fraught with such pain as that day brought to us both.</description>

      <description>Miniature Hindu Raj When I stepped into the Andamnnn there was in it, in prison and outside, what one may rightly call, Pathan Raj. Dressed in brief authority, the Pathan dominated the scone. It was overthrown, ns I Imvo described in thin story, hy the time that my stay in the prison had come nearly to an end. The Pathan raj was gone and Hindu Raj had taken its place. If that was no more than a span, this was no better than one and one-fourth that span.</description>

      <description>Last days In the Andamans Just about this time my younger brother paid me a visit in the Andamans. There was no hope then of my release from that place. My elder brother had continued to be failing in health. And, therefore, the first thought that struck us when we three met together was that perhaps that was the last meeting together of us three. For, the next time that such a permission would be granted to us would be only after the lapse of one year.</description>

In spite of a thousand obstacles in their way, those who had learnt to love and admire me put themselves into contact with me and gave me news about the islands.</description>

      <description>As we alighted from the steamer and touched the port at Calcutta we were put in the lock up at the Alipore jail. The fear that I had felt on leaving Andamans in the morning had but proved too true. Myself and my brother were put in different cells. Wearing our prison-garments and holding our bedding under the arm-pit and our pots and pans in one hand, we were both marching together like thieves directed by our escort of sepoys, when my elder brother was directed along a side passage by the sepoy in charge, and I was taken in different direction by another.</description>

      <description>Correspondence with India and means of information A prisoner in the Andamans was permitted to write only one letter home during the year. The letter had, perforce, to be as brief as possible. Again, it was to be an open letter, to be censored first by the jailor, next by the Colonial Officer, and to be despatched if approved by them. Every prisoner was warned that the letter shall not be forwarded if it breathed a single word against the jail authorities.</description>

      <description>Meeting with friends from the Andamans This was my second visit to Yeravada Jail. First I was put there in 1910 and for the second time now 1923. In those days the prison was full of convicts sentenced in the Mulshi Satyagraha case. They came and they went, all of them political prisoners. Some were punished with whipping. Those who had remained behind used to tell me of their severe ordeal in the Yeravada jail.</description>

      <description>The Coronation Ceremony of 1911 and its shadow on the prison in the Andamans As narrated in the previous chapter, the publication of Mr. Hotilal&amp;rsquo;s letter by The Bengali created a flutter in the official dovecotes. In the wake of that stir and excitement was created an atmosphere of sudden hope in the prison at Andamans. A thick rumour was abroad that all political prisoners, including myself, would be released in a month or two after the Coronation Durbar at Delhi to follow the King-Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Coronation in London.</description>

      <description>Dear Reader
The story is told. The curtain is rung down on it. Two life- sentences have been run. And I have brought together my recollections of them within the cover of this book. They are narrated in brief outline to you; they are put together within the narrowest compass.
When I came into this world, God sent me in it on a sort of life-sentence. It was the span of life allotted to me by Time to stay in this &amp;ldquo;prison-house of life.</description>

      <description>The prisoner&amp;rsquo;s food in the Andamans While these changes were going on in India between the end of 1911 and the beginning of 1912, I had nearly finished my one year of imprisonment in the island of the Andamans. In spite of bad food and inhuman treatment in that prison, I had managed to keep normal health, on the whole, during the period. I may, therefore, give here a general idea of the kind of food we were served in this prison.</description>

      <description>Suicide, Mental derangement, arrests, the second and the third strike In the first six months of my sentence in the Andamans, I was treated as a prisoner in solitary confinement. As a matter of fact almost all other prisoners were sent outside the prison for their work after they had finished their term of six months of simple or hard labour in the prison itself But at the time that they were taken out.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER II
Distortions in Indian History
Introduction: roots of distortion
India gained independence from the British in 1947, or more than fifty years ago. But intellectually and educationally India continues be a European colony. This is because, during the first forty years of her existence as a free nation, the Congress Party and the intellectual establishment, continued to encourage colonial institutions and thinking. The result today is that there is an English educated elite that identifies itself more with the West than with India and her ancient civilization.</description>

      <description>Intro  Social and medical work was/ is used by the missionaries to prepare the ground for conversion. Though Christian propaganda may use the following creed to spread &amp;ldquo;1. Do good to your neighbours. 2. Forgive your enemies. 3. Spread my message all over.&amp;rdquo;, we have noted that Christianity is far more sinister.  Mother Teresa, the angel from hell  Christopher Hitchens says: &amp;ldquo;MT was not a friend of the poor.</description>

      <description>Current status  Territorial aggression by mainland China is being opposed by a good coalition of neighbors - India, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia, Russia.  Recent history  &amp;ldquo;The Han civilization was largely demolished by the cunning mlechCha-s, followed by a stern cut from the samurai’s blade. However, the mlechCha-s in their conquest of Japan ended up giving the chIna-s a new leash of life. The chIna-s not being the type that easily passes up an opportunity took the chance to resurrect their power and display their belligerence ever since.</description>

      <description>Abrahamist bias  Political sympathies, and the victor writes history phenomenon. Examples elsewhere  Junipero Serra canonization G2015.    Islamophilia  Criticizing Islam means criticizing their own Christian past - fundamental problems are the same. To modern Europeans, the fundamental evils of intolerant Abrahamisms (Eg. Banu Quraiza massacre) are abstract concepts, as are Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno and the emperor Julian. The Aurangzebs, Mahmuds and Aladins (ie their early Christian equivalents) of Europe are about as abstract as the forgotten Roman Gods.</description>

      <description>Desiderata (cross-national) We are in favor of the following (subject to change):
  A strong revival of paganism (potentially bound by the meta-template of hinduism) as an alternative to the Abrahamic religions.
  Protection of individual freedom to the maximum possible extant.
 Freedom of speech and its limits - see here. Marijuana should be legalized and regulated - just like alcohol, tobacco, red bull and coffee.  Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol.</description>

      <description>Bede account : TW. Translation of Pope Gregory&amp;rsquo;s letter to the Abbot Melitus (This epistle is dated in the 19th year of the Emperor Maurice): &amp;ldquo;To his most beloved son the Abbot Melitus Gregory the servant of the servants of God We have been much concerned since the departure of our congregation is with you because we have not received any account of the good success of your journey When Almighty God shall bring you to the most man our brother Bishop Augustine tell him upon the most mature deliberation upon the affairs the English I have thought of that is that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to be destroyed but let the idols that are in them be destroyed, let holy water be made and sprinkled in the said temples, let altars be erected and relics placed.</description>

      <description>Consider the list of individual heroes involved in politics and war. Thence we learn the following. Where ever kShatriyas tasked with protecting their land (as if it were their wife) and subjects (as if they were their children) fell, others rose to take their place (eg: harihara and bukka, chandragupta maurya, shivAji, reDDi chieftains). They were guided and inspired by learned men and sages (eg: tukArAm, vidyAraNya, chANakya). Further, their efforts were financed often by taxation, but also sometimes by donations from merchants.</description>

      <description>Disdain for &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo; hindu  Sikhism has latent abrahamist tendencies. In a way, it is proto-islamophile-secularism. Same with many baba-isms. See anti-hindu patterns page for details.  mIri-pIri  It aimed to rearm hindus (spiritually and materially) during oppressive Mughal muslim times by emphasizing (even by &amp;ldquo;democratizing&amp;rdquo;) kShatra. In a sense, they revived the Steppe warrior ethos - albeit in a limited sense (lacking in sophistication, and with many unArya tendencies).</description>

      <description>Intro  So, the representation of Hindu traditions by dry scholars tends to be maddeningly flawed (whether in their textbooks, books or talks). Practitioners on the other hand are more reliable. But a *scholarly practitioner* is the best. This is the difference between शुष्क-पण्डितता and आर्द्रमना ऋषिः.  Analogies: How valuable (to insiders or outsiders) are books about making Indian music or dancing, if written by one who does not do either?</description>

      <description>Here we examine problems of democracy and briefly consider alternative systems of government
Problems  The &amp;ldquo;one person one vote&amp;rdquo; paradigm prominent in democracies rests on an unnatural, false assumption: That all men are equal in their abilities and judgement. Politicians compete for attention and approval of masses (who in heterogeneous countries like India tend to be bottom heavy - ie dominated by incompetents). So, their legislative goals and administration becomes flawed.</description>

      <description>Raid booty to market hogging Via MT.
 Yuanshi records an interesting conversation between kulashekhara Pandya-I &amp;amp; the ambassador of Kubilai Khan. The pANDya states: &amp;ldquo;All Muslim states make full use of their countries’ natural products- gold, pearls and precious objects [and with] all their surpluses the Muslims come [here] to trade&amp;rdquo; This suggests that by 1280 CE the Mohd were using their wealth to get a grip on South Indian markets.</description>

For instance, in say the Marahaṭṭā country, where we formerly lived, there was the system of the bārā balutedāra-s which has perhaps lasted in some form from the pre-Āryan days of the Harappan civilization. This system comprised of 12 jāti-s who offered essential services for a village.</description>

      <description>Long term malaise A muslim society is, in the long term, bad for the muslim population itself, due to:
 Misogyny taking many forms:  Forced veil for women, Taharroush rape game, female genital mutiliation.   Opposition to free spirited scientific enquiry in general. Islam is bloody within and without. So, muslims tend to fight each other to death about what &amp;ldquo;true islam&amp;rdquo; is and who is a &amp;ldquo;heretic&amp;rdquo;. Opposition to joy of many types, and increase in &amp;ldquo;victimless crimes&amp;rdquo; at worst, or a schizophrenic acceptance at best extending to even allowance of child abuse (eg.</description>

      <description>Sri gurubhyo namaha!
Nuruddin was hallucinating and he knew it. That image of gold and red kept coming back to him, his eyes were reeling under the excessive light inside his brain, sending shockwaves through his body. He shivered more out of a need to shrug off this preposterous reality than fear. How was it even possible?
The streets sang with the camaraderie of foreign tongues, the lotus filled ponds and lakes were lit up with oil lamps all along the perimeters, the two-storied guest houses were decorated with mango leaves and rangolis, roads lined with flowering trees, incense-filled the air, fragrant in the cool spring dusk, beautiful dancing women heady with exquisite gold jewellery, tinkling bells and silver anklets, gliding gaily towards the massive structure, skipping and hopping, climbing the steps like deer springing away from strange sights… all this easy laughter heralded certain doom.</description>

      <description>Intro 5 May 1949, Punjab High Court, Peterhoff, Simla, India
Nathuram Godse assassinated Gandhiji on 30 January 1948. The trial began on 27 May 1948 and concluded on 10 February 1949. He was sentenced to death.
An appeal to the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the sentence was upheld. This statement is the last made by Godse before the Court.
WHY I KILLED GANDHI Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture.</description>

      <description>Principle  Even if greater disengagement from western indology results in less vigorous study of hindu past in the short term, it will at least be on strong foundations. Genuine and honest Hindu/ sanskrit scholarship does not need the shelter of academia to emerge.  There are religious institutions, rich circles of connoisseurs form around local experts in the shAstra-s.    Examples of foolish engagement  Bad funding: Various idiot rich hindu-s funding sanskrit/ hindu chairs and projects which are liable to be under the influence of anti-hindu academics.</description>

      <description> General understanding of sikh drives and patterns are explained elsewhere. With the emergence of modern Hindutva, the &amp;ldquo;democratization&amp;rdquo; of kShatra by sikhs is superseded (and rendered obsolete) by a better version more consonant with overall Hindu tradition. Within sikhs, the better traditions (see pro-hindu patterns page and sects page) merit encouragement.  </description>

      <description>OUR PAST It spens superfluous to dwell on the achievements of the Hindus in the History of nations. Lord Curzon who cannot be accused of synpathy with Indian aspirations said in his address at the Delhi Durbar in 1901: &amp;ldquo;Powerful empires existed and flourished here, while the Englishmen were still wandering painted in the woods and while the British colonies were still a wilderness and a jungle. India has left a deeper park on the history, the philosophy and religion of mankind, than aty other terrestrial unit in the universe.</description>

      <description>Islamic iconoclasm is well known. Some salient examples are given below. Other examples of anti-iconography sentiment: snowman fatwa, maldives museum attack.  Saudi Arabia and the middle east:  muhammad and the idols at kAbA. The tree planted by ZarathruShTa. ISIL kalIf  Yazidi temples. Museum vandalism and library burning - DM201502. Nimrud. Palmyra.    Egypt, Lybia  &amp;ldquo;Al-Malik al-Aziz Uthman the son of the counter-crusader Salah ad-Din who wanted clean Giza of its jāhilīyah devoted a large amount of labor to demolish the pyramids but only having succeeded in damaging the smallest of the big three eventually gave up.</description>

      <description>General pattern Saints and martyrs  Many saints were criminals. &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Boniface chopped down Thor&amp;rsquo;s Oak sacred to Germanics, &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Nicholas said to have done same in Lycia to Hellenic sacred trees, &amp;ldquo;St&amp;rdquo; Martin did same (later Dutch Protestants defaced his cathedral) If you read martyr stories, you find saints going up and destroying shrines and icons, and then threatening to come back with a crusader army if the pagans refuse to convert.</description>

Kanchi MahasvamI produced foolishness that claimed crazy stuff such as &amp;ldquo;all religions are the same&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ramses and rama are related&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;aztec is probably a corrpution of Astika&amp;rdquo; etc.. (1).  But, a mitigating factor: &amp;ldquo;the AchArya was not a svayaM-devatA-vAdin &amp;amp; upheld the deva-dharma sincerely despite certain serious idiosyncratic misapprehensions&amp;rdquo;.   Criticism  Swami Aksharananda (Guyana) here.    nAtha-sampradAya  &amp;quot; Of the 13 Nath sub-orders, I understand the Rawal or Nagnath order of Punjab consisted of Muslims though it traced its ancestry to Shiva.</description>

Yet, he is also popularly venerated many parts of India as nAtha shaiva, rAmabhakta, recited bhagavadgItA, dattAtreya bhakta, dattAtreya himself etc&amp;hellip; The devotees have come up with a yantra, gAyatrI mantra &amp;amp; even homapaddhati for fakir baba.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am not a Hindu. And I am certainly not a Muslim. So, when I started writing my earlier book Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim Conflict, in the spring of 1990, I was an outsider to this conflict between Hindus and Muslims. But as I ventured deeper into the unique configuration of forces now existing in India, I saw that this was not a conflict between just any two communities.</description>

      <description>Personality  Below, we talk about the Nicene Jesus. (Gnostic Christ seems have been *much* better. There were other &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;quot;s too - some say all of them were fictional.) Jesus, if he existed, was racist. (As more non-jew converts came in, this was subsumed by a broader out-group hostility.)  (Matthew 15:21-28 and Mark 7:24-30) - &amp;ldquo;Gentile (non-Jew) woman once begged him to cast away the demon that had possessed her daughter&amp;hellip; He cold-heartedly told the woman that only the Jews were his children and that the Gentiles were dogs.</description>

      <description>Hinduism is a minority religion in Punjab. During the Khalistan movement, the minority Hindus and Jains were subjected to several attacks. Hindu and Jain temples were frequently vandalized and desecrated. This thread documents a few instances.
It is to be noted that many of these incidents happened prior to the Operation Blue Star carried out by Congress Government in 1984. The attacks of Hindu temples were not confined to just Punjab.</description>

Culled from a series of conversations held over a period of six months with the famous tribal leader Rojalin Kondh, instrumental in the rebuilding of the Konark Temple, this is the first such written account of a Kui. Basic facts have not been tampered with, but some liberties have been taken in embellishing the account to make it more reader-friendly.</description>

      <description>Context From divodAsa:
 It is to be noted that it was a Muslim who persuaded the Samuthiris to invade Valluvanad and annex the regions, thus turning the national festival of Kerala, Mamankam, into a bloody battlefield where hundreds and hundreds of Nair youths fought and perished. The Muslim leader who persuaded Samuthiris were given the title Calicut Koya and was appointed as bodyguard of Samuthiri, always taking position to his right side [2].</description>

      <description>Sanskrit vs Farsi  The entry of Persian into India was mostly due to it being the court / official language of a great Muslim kings. It was &amp;ldquo;high culture&amp;rdquo; for them (even if they were ethnic turks). This is how India got the camp language (urdu) with its heavy use of farsi and arabic loan words. Common soldiers in the camps had to converse with the farsi spouting nobility. To quote Sandeep: &amp;ldquo;Kannada was the official language of the Mysore state when the Wodeyar dynasty ruled over the Mysore kingdom…When Tipu took over, he changed the administrative language from Kannada to Farsi.</description>

Stop favoring non-hindu/ anti-hindu religions, and unnecessarily controlling hindu affairs. Temple control out of sickular government hands.  Karnataka has spent a mere 1/5 of the money it earned due to its management of hindu temples/ institutions for upkeep/ donation. The rest was assigned to Muslim and Christian institutions (ES).   Various cases of double standards by Indian courts should be curbed.</description>

      <description>This is not to deny the positive contribution and truly objective scholarship of some western academics towards the understanding of Hindu past and Hindu nationalism. Yet, we Hindus have shown ourselves to be internally capable of doing all this, and the subversive actions do stand out as a liability. Western academic setup also includes Indians trained in and beholden to that system. This list does not excuse shoddy research, bad presentation and bad behavior by some Hindu-s.</description>

      <description>Find inter-school rivalries &amp;ldquo;What do we understand by contextualizing the texts? Lineal conflicts and personal attacks that developed into prolonged clashes between the gurukulas, for instance. And the scribal errors purported to be as such but purposely employed devices to alter meaning or variants resulting from the popularity of the text in vernacular traditions. Even beneath an ostentatious eulogy, we may decipher a lamentation if carefully gone against the grain by following the paronomastic hints or “slesharthas“.</description>

      <description>(1) Maharashtra Physiography :
Besides being simple and honest in their habits, Maharashtrians from ancient times (1) have always been brave warrior sufficiently hardy to meet any challenge and tenacious to hold on inspite of unspeakable hardships. That has been their nature for which to a greater extent, the physical conditions of the country are responsible.
&amp;ldquo;The characteristic features (2) of the Maharashtra country are the great mountain ranges which enclose it on two sides, the Sahyadri range running from north to south, and the Satpura and Vindhya ranges running from east to west, The minor ranges, which break out in rugged outline from these mountain Chains and from the watersheds of many rivers which fall ultimately into the Godavari and into the Krishna, give the whole country an appearance ruggedness and unevenness not to be met with in other parts of India on such a scale.</description>

These people want approval and admiration of others. This is the disease that motivated moronic actions right from dharmarAja to PrithvirAja Chauhan to Nehru and Gandhi.
 Think what kind of disaster it would have been if kRShNa thought that way. That yudhiShThira gave duryodhana his choice of weapon and combatant when he emerged from the lake hiding spot, and kRShNa scolded him - &amp;ldquo;Again, even now you are gambling!</description>

Note: at 38:01 in this National Geographic documentary, they say: &amp;ldquo;These statues did not loose their heads by accident&amp;hellip; What the Hindu priests started, muslim invaders completed.&amp;rdquo; Equating Hindu priests and Muslim invaders is vile deception.</description>

Dear Shri Khushwant Singh,
Please accept my thanks for making it known (Hindustan Times, May 2) to a large number of people that Koenraad Elst exists in flesh and blood, and is not Sita Ram Goel&amp;rsquo;s invention or disguise.
Far from being &amp;ldquo;made up by BJP&amp;rsquo;s propanganda wing&amp;rdquo;. most people in the RSS/BJP crowd believed and said that it was was I trying to pass under a foreign name and a changed style.</description>

      <description>The battle of freedom once begun
And handed down from sire to son
Though often lost is ever won!!
To-day is the tenth of May!
It was on this day, that in the ever memorable year of 1857, the first campaign of the War of Independence was opened by you, Oh Martyrs, on the battle-field of India. The Motherland, awakened to the sense of her degrading slavery, Unsheathed her sword, burst forth from the shackles and struck the first blow for her liberty and for her honour.</description>

      <description>Judging non-superficially Let us put it this way – with “Skin in the game” to keep it real. Even an impartial neutral non-hindu atheist might see the point.
Would one, as a father of two young Hindu girls, want to live in the midst of a muslim neighborhood (punjabi, bangla, moplah, kashmiri take your pick)? A burmese buddhist neighborhood? A Balinese Hindu neighborhood? A vietnamese buddhist neighborhood?
I mean – The muslims can eat all of the same chicken Tikka masala and the Vietnamese can eat all the cocroaches they catch.</description>

      <description>Preface
The first half century of India’s existence as a free nation is characterized by two significant failures: first, a failure to define the concept of India as a nation; second, a failure to evolve national institutions in education and intellectual life. In other words, a comprehensive failure to define a vision of nationalism rooted in the country’s history and culture. The result is that anti-national forces have had a field day, seriously undermining national security.</description>

      <description>Most historians, British as well as Indian, have described and dismissed the rising of 1857 as a ‘Sepoy Munity’ or at best ‘The Indian Mutiny’. Indian revolution is on the other hand, and national minded leaders thinkers have regarded it as a planned and organised olitical and military rising aimed at destroying the British power in India. Mr. Sawarkar’s is an attempt to look at the incidents of 1857 from the Indian point of view.</description>

 For 89-year-old Challa Chandra Reddy, the memories of August 27, 1948, are vivid. “August 27 is observed as a dark day in Bairanpalli. It was on this day in 1948 that 92 residents of Bairanpalli were slaughtered mercilessly. Women were raped and terrorised. Razakaars went up to the extent of making women play bathukamma naked,” he claimed. (In Navaratri, Batukamma festival is celebrated by Telugus.</description>

      <description>Hindu law:  Reconversion to the hindu ethos was codified in the devala-smRti [PVK_IMG1, TW17] and Vignaneswara’s commentary to Yagyavalkya Smriti [S].  Risks from converts While Hindus get all excited (and rightly so) about foreigners taking to their religion; one must note that foreign converts to Hinduism bring with them significant risks - so, caution is appropriate:
 Malhotran U-turn: The convert learns some Hindu tattva or technique, faces some social pressure to return to original bearings, repackages the H tattva or technique in Christian/ Jewish terms.</description>

Regional rivalries can often be exploited by enemies of Hindus. Claiming to address genuine or imagined grievances, they can weaken the Hindu state. Example: &amp;ldquo;Dravidian&amp;rdquo; faultine and the Anglospheric interventions.  Language  (Regional) Language chauvinism is a front for secularism.

      <description>Summary Arab or Islamic or Christian science are but continuations of prior pagan traditions.
 &amp;ldquo;Arab&amp;rdquo; science wasn&amp;rsquo;t Arab, but Persian (Avicenna, Biruni, AlKhawarizmi (Algorithm), etc.), Syriac, Chaldean, from long traditions that preceded the Arab invasion. They just wrote in Arabic; Newton wrote in Latin but isn&amp;rsquo;t called &amp;ldquo;Italian&amp;rdquo;. - NN Taleb
 Neo-platonic influence and rejection  &amp;ldquo;So in reality the so called “Islamic Science” was a venture of the pagan Neo-Platonists fleeing the terror of Isaism, and many of the early “Islamic intellectuals” like Thabit ibn Kurra were by their own admission Hellenistic pagans.</description>

Hence it merits a separate page. Alternative phrases that helps us understand secularism better  sickularism (via Ambreesh) - post-christian christianism.</description>

      <description>Orthodoxy on fundamental Islamic tenets.   As Carl informs: &amp;ldquo;In Islamic philosophy, ahadiyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Uniqueness&amp;rsquo; of Allah, and occurs commonly in very fundamental surahs like Ikhlas. Wahdaniyyat refers to the &amp;lsquo;Oneness&amp;rsquo; of reality.&amp;rdquo; Theologians like Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi used these two concepts in his formulation of an epistemological Wahdat-ash-Shuhood (oneness of creator and created only in the eyes of the witnesser) as opposed to the older ontological formulation of Wahdat-ul-Wujood (oneness of existence; ie creater and created are one).</description>

      <description>video source p1 and p2. machine transcription below.
usually when we hear this term secret history the connotation of ten is of a narrative that is either suppressed lost forgotten but somehow not accessible. however i use this term secret history in context of the jammer with a slightly different meaning. secret not because it is suppressed or lost actually history of the earth is pretty much available in plain sight - very easily accessible.</description>

The records show that Tipu authorised sixty seven grants of rent-free land, primarily to temples and mosques, solely for the taluks of Calicut, Ernad, Bettathnad and Chowghat.</description>

      <description>Broad goals RoP is a memetic (ie mental) disease of epidemic proportions. It CANNOT coexist with devadharma in the long run- one WILL have to give way to another. Carriers of this memetic disease, ie muslims, should be urgently quarantined and treated with compassionate firmness. We may look at how other nations are dealing with the problem. As part of such efforts, fertility of the disease-ridden population should be severely contrained.</description>

      <description>Legal divisions   Maddhab Map2    Current Islamic jurisprudence largely affirms the purported intolerant attitudes.  Prominent sunni schools  Hanbali jurisprudence is considered very strict and conservative, especially regarding questions of creed. Hanbali school holds that the two primary sources of Islamic law are the Qur&amp;rsquo;an and the prophetic tradition; the Hanbali school is known for its strong emphasis on verifying and utilizing the latter on equal ground with the former, whereas other schools granted the tradition a secondary role.</description>

      <description>Vishvaguru attitude is a type of arrogance.
This attitude lurks whenever you hear, these type of statements: &amp;ldquo;veda-s have everything; there is nothing the mlecCha-s have to offer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;rAmAyaNa period we had flying machine, mahAbhArata time we had cloning and nuclear weapons&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;there is no problem with hinduism; it suffices to just follow the shAstra&amp;rdquo;.
Occurance elsewhere That&amp;rsquo;s something shared by late mideval China, and recently by western liberal democrats. Contrast with Japan - she&amp;rsquo;s a student culture - selectively and carefully picked and learned from Indians, Chinese, Dutch, Americans - no &amp;ldquo;know it all&amp;rdquo; attitude.</description>

      <description>Motivating Concepts  Motivating Terrorism  KE: &amp;ldquo;Thus, when Mohammed Atta, Mohammed Bouyeri and hundreds of other Muslim terrorists declare in their farewell letters/videos that their motive is Islam, we have to believe them. But when they talk about Islam, claiming that their own interpretation is the same as Prophet Mohammed’s, we have to ascertain for ourselves the truth of that claim. And then we find that Prophet Mohammed’s intention was indeed closer to al-Qaeda’s than to that of the Sufis, a movement which invokes Quranic authority but was quite unknown in Mohammed’s day.</description>

      <description>Source: Sankrant Sanu here.
Some wolves were let loose among a pack of deer. They hunted in a pack as habitual predators, and started killing off the deer, picking on the young and vulnerable first.
The deer appealed to the State for protection. State said wolves are a minority, they will be protected. But but said the deer, it is we who need protection. We do not interfere with the wolves, we leave them alone, but they don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Intro  &amp;ldquo;Abrahamic Worship&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;pUjA&amp;rdquo; (=adoration) distinction. 1, 2, 3, 4 Abrahamic concept of worship is more rigid - God tells you how he should be served in revelations; you cannot go worship him through idols, for example. So there is the concept of &amp;ldquo;right worship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;false worship&amp;rdquo;.  By contrast, pUjA can take many forms. Consider: आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम्। सर्वदेवनमस्काराः केशवं प्रति गच्छति॥   The famous Abrahamist objection to goes: &amp;ldquo;Worship the creator, not the creation.</description>

“…Āditya Hṛudayam Puṇyam Sarva Śatru Vināśanam….”
Although he did not have to, Seetaraama Sastry Chief Archaka of the oldest surviving Surya Devata temple in the land, decided to dress his lord for the last time. The one in charge of this duty was brusquely told to go and fetch the requisite garments and garlands and various other accessories that would adorn Suryanarayana today while the Chief Archaka himself made sure that he anointed the deity with the best of oils, fragrant with natural essences.</description>

      <description>Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s problem with India (especially kashmir) is not one arising over the need for greater security (or neutralizing a threat) - but is ideological (Christine Fair video says: &amp;ldquo;a greedy state&amp;rdquo;). US strategy has been to attempt to put Pakistan at ease (via-a-vis India) by providing it with more weapons and aids - this has failed.
Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; society has roughly the same ideological preferences as the military. Its youth continue to be conservative.</description>
